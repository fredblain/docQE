Questions: are Stewards after the accident on the bus illegal? 
The law knows it is not, in a Fernreisebus Umherlaufen not allowed the 
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the society student agency in the proximity of the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and passengers on the bus during the journey to run along back and forth. 
"We wanted to comply with the law strictly and formally, it is the work of a Stewards in breach of the law on the road", the spokesman for the Department of Transportation Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, in the last week, a young died Stewardess, was probably caused by the driver of the lorry, the path of the bus kreuzte. 
The young woman sat in that moment, in addition to the driver unfortunately, at the least safe place in the car, even if they have two other jobs. 
A bus at the time but it can also have an accident or sharply curbed, in which the Steward austrägt coffee or newspapers. 
Also plays a role, whether the bus after the Fahrzeugbrief Stehplätzen is also equipped with. 
If this is not provided for in the bus, the passengers sit. 
The Fernreisebusse of student Agency have no Stehplätze; what is the director of the company, janura Radim, compared with aktuáln confirmed. Cz. 
"This we have discussed with the Treasury first, and it has not agreed to the movement of travellers. 
They later scaled back, and we have come to a consensus that the passengers during the journey can go to the toilet, if you have your seat, "he informed his position with. 
The law makes no Steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a Stewards - no law describes this role. 
But there are no law prohibits the transporter to provide services. 
The law on the roads only the concept vehicle companions; its rights and obligations defined, "adds, but not, clearly, the spokesman of the Ministry Hanzelka added. 
The Director of the Department of Transport vehicles on the road Ministry Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, thinks that the law to cover this issue. 
"It depends on whether the bus in the product approval also has Stehplätze. 
This is everything, "he said. 
Buses under parts in Stadtbusse Stehplätze is where it is limited and the maximum speed, with Nahverkehrsbusse Stehplätzen and a higher level of speed and Fernreisebusse without Stehplätze with the highest permitted speed and seats, which are equipped with seat belts. 
As on the plane, says the professional 
The besip-fachmann Jaroslav hoín looks for road safety in the movement of Stewards on board a bus not essential. 
"in a liquid vehicle is not threatening many dangers, the situation is comparable with the service on board an aircraft. 
Here, too, is not sure when turbulence, and the Stewardess can find themselves in the head. " 
"slow sharply, however, a bus, then, of course, also apply the laws of physics. 
As in the Stadtbus or in a tram. 
The safety of the Stewards must clarify the carrier by internal rules ", he says, and also says that these issues from the perspective of the law not fully resolved. 
Janura is prepared to provide services to remove 
Student agency offers as the only Busfirma services of Stewards. 
The company employs some 200 people in this function. 
The director is their profession not even after the accident as a risk to drink. 
"as soon as I but gets the impression that the profession of risk the future Stewards, I will remove him. 
Coffee and newspapers can receive the travellers in boarding. 
That would also reduce costs, "he says. 
As interest in the security justified the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin, the absence of Stewards in his buses. His company, but only a fraction of lines compared with student agency. 
"We have no hostesses, we have been opposed it from the start. 
Ends sooner or later it with some fatal accident ", he had not quite a year for týden. Cz. 
It was an incredible tragedy 
The accident of a lines bus to Naples was a young Stewardess Málaga Pilsen from the region, the two years for the society had worked. 
The Slovenian lorry was probably without abgebogen blinken of the state to touch the bus and had blocked the steam. 
The driver of the bus tried to evade by a strong manoeuvre, but with the right front kollidierte with the lorry. 
That the two jobs for the Stewards janura disputes are sold. 
"This jobs can not be reserved for long-distance, they are blocked." 
Firm wants to sue the lorry drivers. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency will not wait on the Court's judgment, a financial compensation they expected but also from the culprits. 
A change in the law? 
Not in sight 
A precise regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus, which could bring a statutory regulation, which involved a team of experts of the Department of Transportation dreißigköpfiges already operates more than a year. 
"This, however, is still at no specific conclusion. 
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones in the journey ", so professional hoín. 
"The Transport Ministry considers the activities of the Stewards not as something that passenger safety, much could threaten Hanzelka", with the control of the safety of the buses within the jurisdiction of the police and the employment protection authorities.
