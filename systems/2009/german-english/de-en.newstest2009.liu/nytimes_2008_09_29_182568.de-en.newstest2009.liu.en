Obscure street in town, often forget to sell may soon. 
New York City has thousands of main roads, side streets, avenues and other bypass roads which some famous and others only convenient. 
However, it is even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing local difficult to say where an extra place, simply because most people have never heard of. 
These tiny street is in the East village and runs from the first street towards North between Bowery and second trappers, without the second street. 
It is 30 foot wide and 120 feet long and is, rather, for a dusty alleyway after a actively used as a transit streets. 
There is also no road signs. 
It is practically impossible to find them to a standard-straßenplan. 
This road has nevertheless your admirer. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company, which recently luxuriöse buildings on the first street has put in place. 
It wants an extra place new pflastern, about a clean passage to the shops and Boutiquen in the new buildings are expected. 
Verehrern belongs to the rest of the longstanding neighbourhood, which says that it is fascinated by the short alleyway, simply because they are one of the remnants of the past in blocks of houses. 
But the stadtverwaltungs department for protection and construction of the flats is responsible and is responsible for the street, has no interest to preserve it. 
During a meeting of the Committee for land use of the Parish Council this month, representatives of the City Council and Avalon Bay a proposal for the purchase of the road through the construction company raised. 
However, the Committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan, which is to be presented next month, so Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the town council 3. 
"very little room is owned by the city remained extra, and we want to belong to continue to place the city, she said. 
"It could be offers, as one the road repair and is pursuing what could be done by Avalon, but we also want guarantees that the public access." 
Avalon Bay has announced a few months, the small street pflastern and set up a new seats, which, among other things, are intended for a café in which the company would like to lease space. 
The idea that the street could buy Avalon Bay was, for the first time during the session this month. 
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road while it wants to you, but not necessarily possess. 
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is these dilapidated to renovate alleyway at a public meeting and to make it," said and added that the city itself the sale had proposed. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the department for building protection insisted that it was indeed the desire of the city, the street to sell and stressed that the responsibility of the department is to develop the property rather than to administer. 
Compared with its colourful neighbourhood of the Bowery place extra, has something of his historic impression. 
Some believe that her name in the years the street 1802, as a large farm, owned by Philip Minthorne divided between his numerous children and a close strip of land from anyone was used. 
The back door of the Musikklubs CBGB, the Punkrockdenkmals, which was closed in 2006, opened the extra place and the road is certainly the most known as backdrop for the photograph on the cover of Albums' 'by Ramones to the current long. 
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the managers of the Ramones, of the photograph in November 1976. 
The street was full of scrap metal, shackles and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and Seilen. 
Some residents, einschliesslich of bloggers on the letter of the East village Gentrifizierung, the idea of the sale of extra place, rejected the argument that this public piece of land, however modest as it is to continue to remain in public. 
Others have an extra place than a rarity - a virtually unchanged cluster of the city, should be left in peace. 
Jeremiah died Moss, the blog name 'Jeremiahs verschwindendes New York wants (' 'the book under has the complaints: a bitter nostalgic view of the dying city "), has a part of the discussion of Stadtgeschichte on an extra place, published in the journal," the New York' that appeared in the year 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, said: "an extra place is a small narrow cul-de-sac, even during the day and by verrostete Metalltüre darkness remains the warehouses, closed windows and Regenrinnen wochenalte newspapers is flying over". 
With few exceptions, the street just as recently appeared in one evening. 
A rat ran through the back of the part of the street, not far from the door, the sooner to CBGB, where today a more expensive clothes shop. 
Graffiti on the walls were to see and an empty Bierflasche was on the ground not far from a fresh set of ausrangierten newspapers. 
Some shoppers said they had rarely thought about an extra place, but proposed that the road could be something aufpoliert. 
Fields, added that in his view, some people the attraction of the road in its current state underestimated. 
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places in the dark, damp and disgusting manner.
