The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, in a city of special kind 
Hidden between the excesses of leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles from the flashy, noisy and towering drive away, is a quiet city in which the pride and the complications of Afro-amerikanischen culture come to light. 
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the city, Zora Neale Hurstons, is not as simple as Hurston to describe it in 1935: "the city with five lakes, three Krocketplätzen, 300 Brown hides, 300 good Schwimmern Guaven, more than enough, 2 schools and no prison." 
It is nowadays a pilgrimage site. 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and ruby Dee, for the annual festival in Eatonville Zora, came at the most famous author of Harlem renaissance memory. 
And still remains the city and the describes it as a Touristenausflugsziel made by including them in the Florida began the tour guide to periods of depression by the Federal writers' project has been produced in many ways a place of particular variety. 
Eatonville is so independent, solid and private as in the 1930s than Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida are often refused to their true ideas to share with the Weissen man, "so little about us knows that he cannot escape what he knows." 
Even nowadays, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama, at an open dialogue on race relations, there are many calls to suffering, of Aussenseitern to be seen. 
"We are very anxious as our history is telling me 'Hortense Jones, 59, from birth, a resident of the town and Community Member of the oldest Church of the city. 
It must vote. " 
Eatonville was a paradox of triumph for a long time, and the fight. 
It is both a historic example of the black movement as a community of nearly 2,000 inhabitants, in the poverty levels twice as high as the national average. 
It is a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example of the - sometimes sentenced, sometimes touted - black culture of rural south, whose roots lie in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that residents here both proud and at the hat. 
And really began the concerns of Eatonville's image with Zora Hurston, as all of the names. 
It was the world their city, in books by heart, and in Mundart were written, as "Mules and men '' (1953) and" their eyes were watching God (1973). 
Five paragraphs in the Florida tour guide modified the city, which is very close to the route 77, a road through the centre of Florida, oft-vergessene leads to the scene of black history and human drama. 
Vehemently as Oskar, both in real life and in the literature, led to the shop by readers of Hurston Eatonvilles first mayor, Joe Clarke wrote, and then to privateren affairs. 
"off the roads on the left," wrote it, "is the brown -weiss angestrichene modern school, with its leafy gardens and game creation that always Howard Miller, although he can barely read and write." 
It also mentioned the new man from widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn 'drinks of any kind was-auch-immer and sold to hours of rooms fit. " 
In just a few hundred words expressed so Hurston Eatonville with even government in connection, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
It was certainly not a tour guide. 
In fact, this was not a Portrait, which was estimated by everyone. 
"Zora described the situation as they were in the 90 year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the girls verewigte johnson- Hurston, quoted by the men, who sang songs on their beauty, the full sexual innuendo. 
They added: "some people liked it". 
It is still here as a lively Exzentrikerin Hurtson regelmässig, who returned after their family after Jacksonville, Florida, was drawn. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, reminded that if Hurston gebraust came in the city, they usually without warning, in a noisy, Chevrolet rauchend and with trousers, the suicide today in a city is something at their August Kleidungsstil holds. 
According to Mr Franklin, the majority of people fascinated, though many despise them. 
"The people were always happy to see Zora ', said Mr Franklin. 
But "they remained never too long," he added in his chair while he was added to the back schaukelte, at an altitude of the terrace listening to the Sabelia sea, in the eyes of Hurston in all likelihood was baptised. 
As Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and a copy of their books. 
Together with the majority of the world Eatonville seemed to have forgotten about it. 
Although it was once a famous author, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black women on Barnard college in the 1920ern, they have been in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they were buried in an anonymous grave. 
In Eatonville, there was no major commemorations, no public readings in high style. 
"I do not think that their contribution in the world, or at least have understood their heritage," Valerie Wrapped Boyd, author of "in Rainbows", a post on Hurston which was published in 2003. 
The turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the city, in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the Community. 
Orlandos suburbs already had the motorway 4 through the western outskirts. 
The proposal was put forward as a Eatonville, still of a difficult phase in its history a fortnight. 
Forced integration, among other things, the relatively idyllic isolation of the Community. 
In the 1950s led the fight against racial mixing hatred in the Community. 
"in this time was often a bunch of white boys and they alleged oranges and stuff people who sit on the sidelines," said Mr Franklin. 
"There was even a woman was killed in the process. 
They raised a water melon from the car. " 
Hurston in 1955 behind asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the call of the Supreme Court to force, integration, making its decision in the case of brown as "offensive against the Schulrat respektierend 'instead of my race. 
Inhabitants say today that although the lifting of racial division in some respects was positive, the groups cohesion in Eatonville and self-assurance weakened his young people. 
"black children were used to be, hugged it - I remember - one embraced his teachers in the morning and it embraced his teachers on the evening in N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the not-for-profit group for the protection of Eatonville community. 
It could be maintained for so long, they added, not by teachers and pupils came more from the same place. 
"We embraced his White teachers not, because he was a white teacher - I think there is a cultural divide there," said Mrs Nathiri. 
But the rights of citizens have contributed to the fact that room for further Zora Neale Hurstons has been created - black writers, actors and artists who put themselves through prejudices, as they did with positive self-esteem and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society! 
"I do not understand it. 
In 1975, the novelist Alice Walker on the path to Hurstons nameless grave and started for the revival of their glory. 
Five years later was a lot of Robert e. Hemenway hurston-biographie promised to find shelves in the books, and made it back to a part of the American Literaturkanons. 
The fernstraßen project had just at a time in the Eatonvilles most famous daughter once again in the light of public opinion. 
And this time they saw as Retterin Hurstons old neighbours. 
The Community began in 1988 with the planning of Hurston festival in order to show what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the Eröffnungsevent two years later, and every January return many for the celebration. 
Some years later, the district not by its roads. 
"The plans a fünfspurigen Fernstraße crowded the city, accelerated the whole thing with top speed, we were left with genuine," said Mrs Nathiri Bürgerstolz. 
Mrs Boyd put it somewhat easier: '' Zora Eatonville saved. 
The victory against the fernstraßen project prompted a change of the image of the city. 
There were more and more, as Rachelle Zugereiste Munson, a lawyer, here in the Church since 1993, and native started the past. 
Eatonville in 1998, the national historic register. 
A new einstöckige library (of course) opened named after Hurston in 2006 on the neugepflasterten and verschönerten Kennedy boulevard. 
Eatonville, today, it is still a peculiarity in Florida: just 6 miles from the city centre anfühlen Orlandos, it can sometimes feel like a Hintergasse in the summer rains as small as at that time, only 27 of black families in the 1880ern was established. 
(it is currently 90% black.) 
Outsiders in search of the history Eatonvilles and its importance are often still treated with caution. 
For most interviews, the approval in the run-up to necessary and certain things - just as the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles eldest church which was painted by a Weissen and black men in the toil - should not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a bold, confident teacher with a preference for Dunkelrot, still fear that their abgeschirmte Community is misunderstood. 
And yet at the same time to the hurston-festival bigger, was also a greater degree of Heimatstolz was born. 
Young people in particular tend to be regarded as Hurston Eatonville saw their whole race: beautifully, with all its problems, either worse or better, and just as proud, creative and diligent, like any other ridiculous and durchmischt Rassen- and international group in America. 
It is the sincere love for this city in the voice of Mr Franklins, the 18-year-old nephew can hear Edwin Harvey, the plans after the college after Eatonville back, in the town hall or in order to work with the police, according to him, which could use some help. 
And even the younger, as Alondra Kenon and Alexia, eleven-year-old twins from winter park, Eatonville, have learned to describe correctly. 
"the most people, the only here, will think: 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the other," said Alondra Kenon recently after the Church on a Sunday. 
"But if we actually stop and a moment of its history of view it is a very beautiful city."
