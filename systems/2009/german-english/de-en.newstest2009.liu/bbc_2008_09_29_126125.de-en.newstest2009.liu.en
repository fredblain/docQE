Former prime minister of Bangladesh will be denied bail 
A court in Bangladesh has a cautionary request of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina rejected, which means that they could be arrested if they return to the country. 
Their defenders said, is that the Court refused bail on charges of 729,700 Taka ($50 million) from a businessman extortion, while she was Prime Minister. 
The case is one of several pending accusations of corruption against them. 
Sheikh Hasinas longstanding political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month. 
Sheikh Hasina is due to meet in the next few weeks to return to Bangladesh, but her party, the Awami alliance, demanded that the military backed transitional government in its first full freedom. 
The correspondents say that, even though it was granted Haftaussetzung abroad for medical treatment in order to go in the context of their release, it is not clear whether they can remain to remain at liberty if they return to Bangladesh. 
Her lawyers say that they are now up to the Supreme Court against the decision of the High Court appeal. 
"The upper Court has rejected Kautionsbitte Sheikh Hasinas, because it says that they must have given no bail, because it is already on Haftaussetzung abroad in order to be treated abroad," said their lawyer Rafique-ul Huq. 
We will be a legal complaint against the top court. " 
Her lawyers argue that they seek bail from abroad in order to return the country to prepare for the elections in December. 
It is expected to Sheikh Hasina after 17 October will return home on Sunday, said a awami-b√ºndnis-parteivorsitzender. 
It was arrested last year after the army backed transitional government took power in June, but has been released from prison for medical treatments in order to go abroad. 
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against itself.
