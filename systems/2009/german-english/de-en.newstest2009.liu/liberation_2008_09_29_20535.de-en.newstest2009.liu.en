'' have you noticed that an election took place in Minsk? ' 
Young people and opposition marched Sunday night on the capital of Belarus Hauptplatz, in advance to reject the results of the parliamentary elections. 
A few hundred Belarussians, gathered Sunday evening for closure of polling stations in the market square of Minsk, in order to combat the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections to protest. 
Although no result was announced, so many young people have come against the power of Alexander Lukachenko to demonstrate: '' the dictator should resign. 
Some admit that they have not even elected: 'What is the point, if you with my vote but always do what they want,' says a young people. 
They do not believe that the regime, which is the foreign observers in the best light has shown that the negotiations with the European Union, is willing to resume a democratic change. 
The sanctions, including the floor of visas for 40 leading Belarussian personalities and the Aufeislegen certain assets, could be lifted if these elections from the observers evaluated as a clean. 
According to the opposition, they were not. 
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the count, he regretted Yuri Potemkin, press spokesman for the Union of democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of 12 parties. 
This is a cosmetic change, said Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate for the presidential elections in 2006 and leader of the pro-europa-bewegung, because it is important to know who the voices ausz√§hlt, and in us, it is the executive. 
If Members of the opposition in Parliament, then vacated because they were appointed, not elected. 
But she joined Parliament can air time on television, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals mean. ' 
The opposition is, therefore, guilty of interference in the political game, because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be opened. 
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia in a crisis and we are not reform, we run the risk of a protectorate of Russia. 
Now, we want to be independent. '' 
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the voting process, the choice is not as valid. 
She points out that the wahlbeteiligungs figures seem too high, and that the extension of the voting in advance (26% of the electorate of Minsk) the way for any kind of manipulation has paved. 
"they have noted that there has been an election? asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners have been released in August of this year. 
In the polling stations was nobody. 
And it will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, and the ones who are most likely to meet the ideas of the government. ' 
The silence of the night, cut back across the Oktoberplatz. 
President Lukachenko congratulate on television and the members of the Central Election Commission to their success.
