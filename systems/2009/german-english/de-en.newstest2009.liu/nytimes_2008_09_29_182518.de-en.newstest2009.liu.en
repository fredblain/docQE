Innenverteidiger Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after he in the last eight and a half years in camping jets-trikot auflief. 
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the Jets a ergebnisloses Triumphzug enclosed in a game. 
"this sort of thing I have ever seen," said Ellis. 
After a schlampigem game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the bad weather, began the second quarter. 
However, no passport in Favres Lavernues Quarterback arrived for a 12-yard-touchdown Coles, marked the beginning of a afternoon the perfect blend of their burgeoning cooperation made a giant leap forward. 
Coles Favre found in this quarter for two Touchdowns, this time as a held foreign defender ausrutschte and other times 10 seconds before the end of the mid-term. 
"I am not particularly hard, 'says the Coles on the passes to Coles. 
"He is a Superspieler. 
Our vote has, no matter what the people think. " 
While Favre Coles, played catch and took the defence Quarterback Kurt Warner. 
Außenverteidiger Darrelle Revis started counting from a disastrous exploits and has turned it into a 32-yard-touchdown. 
Libero Erik Smith came to a different passport and went away with it. 
Linebacker David Bowen's IRA then for a loss of Warner. 
The last Ballverlust, enforced in Bowen's, was probably the verrückteste. 
The Cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game than the Jets conquered the ball back conquered and Jay Feely to a 20 yard shot leadership has turned 34 to 0. 
It was the most points in a quarter of the Jets had ever made. 
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini said the coach would the Jets' the second quarter or the third quarter? " 
Both on the answer, because the Jets left 21 points in the third quarter without a single, Mangini said: "lend me, I have the second quarter longer comrades from the third. 
A lot of points were achieved in a short space of time. "
