In the elections on Sunday, it was not a member of the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament. 
Russian observers believe that this is the prosperity and stability in the country, conducted by Alexander Lukashenko, however, the OECD suspected breaches of law in the counting of the votes. 
The OECD, from 43 countries, has sent 450 observers, the elections not recognised. 
De terms of 10-millionen-einwohnerstaates does for decades without opposition from the. However, under the name "United Democratic Forces' (ODS) held view before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko seriously hoped for in the unhealthy elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment already 2006 presidential mandate renewed, this time for the fourth time some members of the opposition in the Parliament '' would allow. 
This is why the ODS even by the previously planned boycotts. 
The Ukraine, thanks to the rising price of natural gas imports of becoming ever more dependent on Russia economically. For the relief of the price increases were even credits, and the country has included the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the leading gas pipeline across the country, the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition was thus the hope, Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukashenko and other high-level politicians classified as anti-democratic because of the political system in the EU travel ban. 
For a temporary relaxation caused the evaluation report of the election of the OECD, in which the accent on the positive movements, rather than the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from elections - was. 
The quickly, however, the OECD report criticised the campaign on Monday - therefore should not happen opposition in the press, especially the fact that the opposition in the counting of the votes was allowed to be present. 
Despite all this, the opposition is a recovery in the political system: political prisoners have been released in, for example, and Minsk is even prepared to smaller confrontations with Moscow, while it remains the recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with the Ukraine on paper is a FÃ¶derativstaat, the two areas regarded as independent for a month.

"We have here with many problems - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities have obstacles in the way on distribution, but nevertheless, I have noticed that more and more people support the change, even the older", said Milinkevich, in allusion to the fact that not even the most support pensioners' group agrees with the Lukashenko regime whose sole credit for the production of social security. 
"thanks to the debt of the country and the rise of the trade deficit, it is just a matter of time before the to the silence of a Friedhofes gemahnende" Social Security "to crumble, so Milinkevich. 
Unlike the opposition politicians have Russian observers described the election as a democratic. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the actions, and not the words". The absence of the opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the White Russian voters.
