Also rats have feelings 
A rat or a Schabe sanctuary in danger, that means that they also feels fear? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph ledoux is convinced that a lot of animals have feelings. 
Only, as one check whether you could feel the same if you, like we conduct? 
In the Internet Edge magazine '' has been going on for several years, distinguished scientists published contributions. 
Mirror presented online in a series of selected responses to the question, 'What do you think for true, without being able to show this? " 
I believe that animals feelings and other awareness, without conditions have so far I or anyone else could prove where we are not even able to prove that other people of responsibility. 
But in this case, at least we should hope that all human brains are the same basic configuration. 
However, as soon as we move on to other species and issues of the sensitivity or raise awareness in general, we are entering impassable terrain, because the hardware disagree. 
If a rat in danger, it is the same as many other animals: it is dead, retreats or attacks. 
Like human behaviour, which led some scientists to conclude a comparable subjective experience. 
Point, however, I do not believe. 
Two aspects of the brain structure will make it difficult to our subjective experience to transfer to the animals. 
The almost always close to a human consciousness associated with the circuits the roadside präfrontalen cortex (because of his participation in the short memory and the Ausführungs- / management functions). 
This vast region is in humans developed much higher than in the rest of the primates and seems to be lacking entirely in other creatures. 
At least those aspects of our consciousness, präfrontalen depend on the cortex, including the know who we are, and the ability to plan and to decide there is reason to believe that the man even by the other primates. 
Another dramatic nature, in the linguistic human nature: because such a large part of his Erlebens is associated with language, it is often said of the awareness of pesticide. 
Animals in this case could be ruled out. 
But also depended much if conscience of language, it certainly would affect them, so animal awareness, as it may be structured, probably very of most of our differences bewusstseins- situations. 
It is difficult to determine how to raise awareness in other animals may be. 
If, as some internal and subjective measure, yet, either because of the specific hardware, from our own experience, that brings us to analyse his research into major problems. 
Most of my comments relate to the content of the deliberate Erlebens, but there is also another aspect of the awareness, the science should be more easily accessible. 
It could be the consciousness processes of animals without regard to investigate their content, and that is exactly what is happening in studies on the short memory of primates, especially in the case of the Visualisierung. 
But for this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed up instead we are transferred to the neural Korrelate of consciousness than on the causal mechanism: both may be identical or not. 
It is interesting that this approach also stressed the importance of präfrontalen for achieving the cortex Visualisierung. 
What is now for the feelings? 
I attribute it to the fact that an emotive system such as the fear in one of his own activity is conscious brain activated. 
What we describe as a "fear", is the mental state in which we find ourselves if the activity of the brain lokalisierten defence system (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) working memory. 
Feelings are seen as closely tied to the regions of the cortex, the primates and particularly the human arena. 
Associated with the linguistic nature emerge paragon of varying degrees of sensitivity, because we need to use the words and grammar situations can categorise and differentiate ourselves alongside other fault. 
Antonio Damasio, for example, on the other hand, thinks that feelings from primitiveren activities in the body feeling regions of the cortex and the Hirnstammes Jaak Vandemeulebroucke Pankseep similar to emerge, but that is focused more on the Hirnstamm. 
Since this network in the course of human evolution, have not changed much there could well be involved in a generic overarching feelings. 
The theory, I can not disagree with me, but I think it is unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues that what in rats and people like fear, is also likely to appear in both cases: but how they can check if rats and people the same experience, when they behave in the same way? 
A Schabe sanctuary in danger if they also feels fear? 
In my view, no resemblance of behaviour can simply prove Erlebens opportunities. 
It helps the neurale comparison on: rats and people have similar Hirnstämme Schaben, on the other hand, not even a brain. 
But is the Hirnstamm responsible for feelings? 
And even if you could show that for the people: how they wanted to prove it in rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), feelings. 
But I do not know how I should prove it. 
And because their feelings likely differ radically from our (as the human awareness on specific becoming a circles and on language is based), erforsche I prefer the emotional behaviour as the emotional feelings of rats. 
Here offer any progress on the neural level, provided it in rats and people of the same. 
As I language and conscience erforsche in rats, including not feelings, I do not know whether they exist. 
This may consider to be short-sighted, but I come forward, rather than constantly to run against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist.
