What has been produced in the accounting factory of supplement & amp; like? 
On 8 October negotiations will begin in the criminal case against János award, and his accomplices. 
The defendants, particularly in the organised crime, and grossly reckless damage and business fraud, and other criminal actions, among other things, accused of forging documents. 
According to prosecutor from the tenders have been used capitalized resources for their own purposes, while the services provided to deal with counterfeit bills were shown. 
State funds and subsidies from the self-government HUF 65 million in total - are part of the coffers of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal, part in the private funds of individual fees. 
As the investigation authorities were aware of the concern gave the tendering funds fictitious invoices and the clubs should also be failed to comply with its obligations. 
According to the indictment is a large part of the bills have been falsified. 
The accounting units on the market, which bought by Józsefváros Rundsiegel it allowed in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision of the bills on what companies should be issued on the tour, was north of Lake Balaton firmly with the István Lados was sent by János contract. 
In the wake of these '' Erkundungstour Lados pensions and restaurants should track down. 
He asked about the bills, later to Konsumationen on these proposals based bills for the youth and Sportministerium, social welfare and Labour Minister, as well as the autonomy of Budapest cheques. 
These calculations are predominantly by István Lados and his accomplices have been manipulated András ri, according to our information, the latter of those reports for the Constitution is rumoured to have been responsible. 
One of the objectives of Lados' "Erkundungstour" was a Bierlokal. 
As two of the award and CO in 2003 bills issued from the catering company, is the Group of the association neunzigköpfige Biztos Pont Egyesület bewirtet. 
Now, but the head of the business, such a large party would not even get to the local heart suit them. 
Another bill in the summer of 2002, issued at the foundation Jobb jövért, later known as Együtt a Harmadik évezredért, has also serious violation of form and content errors. 
In a retirement in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and not more than ten people at the same time can compose, according to bill 130 guests. 
The imagination of the counterfeiters were also apparently no bounds when it comes to the Pigal Kft., a catering business, in its accounting documents of customers, according to the indictment Hoppá Jobb jövért and not even proceeds of authority. 
As directors of hvg gyz Farkas. Hu indicated that he was immediately clear that it was forged documents, than it was during a survey by the Prosecutor's Office documents were provided. 
"our Firmenname and the tax number were on the mark wrong appropriate". 
And further: apart from procedural irregularities was also the fact wrong that the company is to have a hundred people living there, when they have a total of 11 rooms of the impossible so many people place. 
It is also on the bill, it would have been referred to feed the restaurant for some time now are no longer in operation. 
The diligent accounting counterfeiters have also neglected to check that the Budapest travel agency plans to target them exclusively offers trips abroad, and you have to take barzahlungs Hungarian visits, which indicated the accounting practice of company also denied. 
As it was known as part of the investigation, you are in addition to the bills also cited the VAT, although travel agency based on a country outside the EU, added value are tax-free. 
The level of VAT was a total of four from the hotel. To the foundation Révfülöp Kft Jobb jövért issued bills wrong because the company rather than 25 only 15 per cent VAT, set off by the staff will also be issued only mechanised bills were, however, the counterfeit documents noted. 
Another mistake, of the '' undermine Rechnungslegern was that it was the transport of goods in a case '' as output, although this had stated by the company specialising in investment advice being offered, told the prosecutor with. 
Another procedural irregularities, false accounting format, thanks to the wrong stamp - was that the on Együtt a Harmadik évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület Biztos Pont invoices issued and could be exposed as a fraud. 
As in the case of Ravenna. And the Sportlager BT Kunfehértó, whose business leaders protested that the bills never to have issued. 
Another "errors" is the counterfeiters in the HIB Kft. From Nyíregyháza undermined: this society was at the time (2001) just in dissolution, as the Group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület there have eaten - the Masseverwalter, was not issued, the bills themselves. 
Deliberately falsified 
The other group of Rechnungsleger are people who have been well aware that they are fictitious invoices. 
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal, the Foundation has Ifjú Szocialisták Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the Foundation, a Harmadik Együtt évezredért HUF in a level of some 4 million issued. 
According to the indictment was the manager of the Collab Kft. By one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi exhibition, persuaded the fictitious invoices. 
At the moment Biogate Kft is also in liquidation. Is also worked with award and company: in 2003, the Ltd, the foundation, as well as the Alapítvány Jobb jövért Atlasz vörösfeny Egyesület Egyesület and clubs with counterfeit bills in the total value of HUF have cared for 5 million to not services rendered. 
However, there was also little payment transactions, as the bills immediately after their exhibition cancelled what the victims have forgotten in your documents to be recorded, however. 
The third group of Rechnungsleger covers people directly associated with the defendants. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian business leader of the Delta Trió Kft., a resident in Budapest, where fuel and vehicle but not auffindbaren handelsfirma. 
This company is, in the period from October to December 2005 several bills on the sale of a total of edv-komponenten HUF have issued about 18 million. 
According to investigative authority is the since 14 September 2005 in liquidation lends cash investment Kft. From Kiskunhalas acts as a buyer of these bills. 
Directors of that company was one such documents, which the companies also Iván Kubatov should be delivered between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information has been Kubatov during the investigation, bills on behalf of gmbh. Atlasz and to the clubs, as well as Hoppá Együtt évezredért Alapítvány issued a Harmadik and whose value even touched. 
The companies fa-bani Jos Faipari Kft. And the jos-investment BT by Romanian bricklayers. Are Iván Kubatovs express request to be created. 
But in truth, none of these firms active Angeklagtem which, according to a lack of contracts. 
But he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplices, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, with the preparation of the companies founding documents, he was charged in the name of the companies with premium bills in the clubs in contact, such as issued in Atlasz and y-generáció. 
As a whole, worth a total of 15 bills Kubatov HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies cash investment, Delta, Trió fa-bani Jos Linaxtrade Jos, investment and on the organizations have issued. 
The Prosecutor's office estimates that each Kubatov Rechnungssumme and 10% of the value added tax scheme could have. 
The company would even Kubatov szi-beri BT. For the exhibition imaginary bills have abused - in this case, the bills the candidacy of Biztos Pont disappeared. 
The company y-generáció and Szövetség a modern in January 2006 Magyarországért have their applications in the not-for-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Mihály TMA Táncsics Alapítvány (''). 
Both received the 500,000 Forint, however, have benefited from these sums being derailed. 
At this, you have to cover up the TMA five fictitious invoices of Works team Kft.. 
These calculations were also in the raid of the office of árpád Kemecsei in the Education Ministry assured. 
In the negotiations will now with a confession by some defendants on the approach of the accounting counterfeiting, as they were before the prosecutor, expected to be accounted for. 
A sensation could happen if the main defendants János award to a full confession decides. 
His previous indications were less detailed several times, and even though he had already pledged fully to report about everything, is still waiting for his confession. 
The question therefore remains open to question whether this is in its interests, whether the Socialists a pact with him about the compensation of most of the damage caused by HUF 50 million have concluded, and whether award in return is prepared to take responsibility. 
But it is entirely possible that contract now plays the "Beleidigten" after his requests to alleviate the imprisonment and house arrest have fallen on deaf ears. 
While other criminals with economic offences far greater damage and they do not have paid at liberty, or at least, remains under house arrest, denied supplement this possibility.
