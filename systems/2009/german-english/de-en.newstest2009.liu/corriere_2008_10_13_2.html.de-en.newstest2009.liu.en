Economic Nobel peace prize goes to Paul Krugman 
The economic Nobel prize is for Americans Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity. 
The 55 years old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer, who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the economic and held foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of Enron collapse, Krugman was in an editorial in the New York Times claims that this second event is crucial for the history of the United States as the attacks. 
A prediction that are not little controversy in response, and the economists has been criticised for some years later today, but as quite right. 
"I am surprised and shocked by how quickly the memory of the scandals within the framework of the breakdown of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the public focus," said Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi by the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank is Krugman a "economist of great value", but also a Banalisierer with a "very aggressive style, particularly against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
