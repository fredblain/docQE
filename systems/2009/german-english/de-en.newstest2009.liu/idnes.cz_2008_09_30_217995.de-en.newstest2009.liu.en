Duell on a knife edge: MP3 players against mobile phones. 
We advised you for your choice 
While nearly every mobile phone mp3-dateien playing, may still not use MP3 player. 
It so we, of course, that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
Despite everything, there is plenty of reasons why you should go a stand-alone player. 
The election depends on the kind of the use and the demands of the future owner. 
It is difficult for me to buy the safe at home a splendid expensive music players, in order to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc hearing. 
Even appear on this musical substance not lps, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for it. 
However, they have lps with kind of rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, dream you probably at least by this. 
This is with the music on travel, with komprimierter music - music in the simple mp3-format. 
Here too there is price and quality categories. 
For one, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player to spend eight thousand kronor in the same way, but a pink-floyd-fan headset would be very difficult to cope with the market for twenty crowns. 
Between those two extremes, there is plenty of room for everyone. 
The range is wide. 
The lifetime of the batteries is crucial. 
Some good Music player can happen much more than just music phones, but what can you do not even tacitly. 
No modern equipment is to use as universal as the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, the telephone and the Simsen, it can reflect both music and videos include a better, it is time to have a worse Fotoapparat and can perhaps also navigate. 
And if you add the Smartphons Kommunikatoren, and it was almost a small computer in the pocket. 
It is a minor miracle, because no fridge can complain and no television fotografieren. 
But the universality of mobile phones will also have its disadvantages. 
The more functions on her mobile phone use it, the more often, however, it must be nachladen. 
And the playing of music is one of the largest energy savings. 
Mobile phones can only a few hours longer than zehn-zwölf music playing, mostly it is much less. 
In this regard Music player (especially the easiest) clearly more efficient. 
You should therefore expect cheap mobile phones that they no longer than a few hours of music playing. 
If it is still a telephone call from and about the safety they prefer to buy a Ladegerät for office - which also applies to more expensive equipment. 
On MP3 players, you will not have this problem, also keep the less good at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with a time loading. 
Another problem, then, if you had bought the music on mobile phones. 
Regrettably, only a small part of the equipment on a usb-abschluss, moreover, not every mobile phone without special software on a PC directly. 
We cannot, of course, the music directly on a storage medium had bought tickets, but only a few readers without reduction with the tiny is ready, the memory cards used in mobile phones. 
In players they need up to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
They need the machine only on usb-port with music to feed from your PC. 
Most mobile phones and player of a place Musikbibliothek, in an orderly manner after the name of the performers, the title of the Albums, the genre or, for example, the assessment by users. 
Some devices are only the Baumstruktur of the address register, like the windows, some of them both (Explorer, Sony, Samsung, iriver Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
Player, it is easier to use mobile phones could have more 
In the selection of a specific equipment, they should be especially after the lifespan of batteries, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of Klangs and, of course, also to inquire about bedien comfort. 
As their music above all aid and you hear every day, for example, in the tram briefly, then a given enough mobiles, the mp3-dateien scenes. 
What really almost every mobile phone. 
They must also not very monitor what Musikformate a mobile or a player can process. 
All MP3 create, and most of the music they will just get in this format. 
The format is one of the most widespread, and most of the equipment also wma-format music in the place. 
Less usual AAC (a format that use apple and its iPods). 
Better mobile phones will also be buying music online. 
It just needs on mobile Internet the relevant sides of a providers (or any other provider), and you can buy a song or album. 
This service in themselves can be a clincher for why they should lay Musikhandy. 
It is unfortunate that the offer the service providers badly and confined mostly only on rapid Radiohits. 
The prices are not the lowest. 
In general but the assumption is that it is precisely this kind of the sale of music (be it on GSM, internet or wireless Internet) dominate the music industry in the future. 
The mobile phone, most in itself. 
If they all want to listen to something, they resort to the mobile phone in the Jackentasche, while the player at home is forgotten. 
However, it is important whether they are always headphones, or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung in their account. 
If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeakers, on almost every mobile phone, but only the least MP3 players. 
Probably the greatest advantage of Musikhandys is for many in the price. 
The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand kronor. 
For three and four thousand kronor you will get a very decent Walkman. 
The biggest drawback for the majority will be that no normal headphones are involved. 
The best and technically ausgereiftesten phones for ordinary headphones with a 3,5-mm-öffnung cost up to fifteen thousand kronor. 
The benefit of the player is, once again, in the light operation. 
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity in the operation with the early normal Kassettenrekorder or, for example, the record players is obvious. 
It is not interfering in the form of a mistake employees mobile Internet and then horrendous bill for data transfers. 
What equipment should now be single 
The cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527), usually on a Slot for memory austauschbare microsd (type m2, media, etc.). 
Even if the card nachkaufen, two thousand kronor. 
But respect. 
In the normally only be Basismodellen cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive can also read 8-gb-speicherkarten. 
If they already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then, after they resort, Cowon Creativ Emgeton or Sony, Samsung, iriver. 
According to capacity (Max. 2 GB) then they should not more than 1100 kronor on the table. 
This is one of the more demanding Hörern, they would prefer specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These machines have independent bedien knöpfe for MP3, and bedien comfort is so on the one mp3-players. 
Most here is Sony Ericsson, which Walkman phones from the series of the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kronor, but with a greater storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long akku-lebensdauer (usually 15 hours, a maximum of up to 35 hours) you make MP3 players of the above manufacturers.
