CSU mercy on time. 
At the end of October, about the fate of the fallen Duos huber-beckstein decided 
Despite the Wahldebakels roles in the meantime no heads, at the top of the Bavarian CSU debates have been postponed the staff. 
A party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their posts, the question is how long this mercy lasts. 
The fate of the tandems after the disastrous 17-prozentigen ballot loss on the last October weekend will be decided at the special Congress. 
The deal already gescholtene double act, but suggested that it would not name off their bellies. 
So that you want to appease angry Group and the left's rank and file, a day after the tsunami '' of Bavaria, given the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences. 
Five years ago, admittedly, under the leadership of the in his career highlight the Edmund Stoiber, received the Christian Social Union still 60.7 percent. Now, however, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they could only 43.4% of the votes. 
The CSU was 46 years Alleinregierer '' in Bavaria, which accounts for 18 percent of the German GDP. 
The Conservatives are the dominant force in the also for the Hungarian economy important southern province in the future, but in a coalition government. 
The first signal of the Party internal restructuring, the potential successor Hubers, Vice-President and federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer also involved in the Erkundungsteam, the with the liberal FDP, or the rechtsgerichteten "free voters' exploratory talks on a possible Munich coalition. 
A twist of fate, it is equal that with the list of "free" those Gabriele Pauli voters in the terms, which are imbued anti-stoiber huber-beckstein has exploited by the double act first and then the determined politician abzuservieren mercilessly. 
The csu-f√ºhrung now concentrated all its energies on the stabilisation Becksteins. 
In the transition process will be the Stoiber, pulling the strings so far from the background, took an active role. The former Prime Minister and the 28 September csu-vorsitzender called the "most bitter day of his political career". 
Huber on Monday made a couple of toxic comments in the direction of CDU, in his view, the CSU would have far more support from the sister party deserves. 
Other csu-politiker interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel. 
If the CSU, the 2005 at a national level has contributed to the success, not with a joint venture back on its feet, Merkel can be called after the Bundestag election in September 2009, Chancellor will not return. 
Merkel from their disappointment about the fiasco has made no secret, believes that the ground loss of CSU have a negative impact on the grand coalition will impact in Berlin. 
What, however, relatively: the injured CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats, however, is continuing. 
18.6 percent received the SPD has hitherto best result in Bavaria since 1946.
