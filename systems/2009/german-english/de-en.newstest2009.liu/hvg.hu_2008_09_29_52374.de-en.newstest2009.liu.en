The psychology of Ã¼berbietens - or why we are willing to pay extra 
The buyer in Auctions tend to spend more and therefore to exaggerate the Feilgebotene. 
Neurologen and economic researchers at the University of New York, it is now managed to neurologisch- economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behaviour to be discovered. 
According to a in the "science" magazine published study want the people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, not admit defeat, and we are prepared to pay even inflated prices. 
The researchers have tried, the neurological scheme of this "game" to explore with experimental auction. 
A group of volunteers should play Lotto while the other armed action was taking part in a Games - in both cases, the active brain areas of the subjects through functional magnetischer resonance (fMRI). 
The participants in both play money could win, but there was a increased activity on the part of the Striatum, a complex below the Gehirnrinde, losers of the auction, measured in terms of the correctness of rival plays an important role. 
Among many other functions, this brain region important for the "of reward" of the nervous system is responsible. 
The researchers said the increase in price would be to avoid overreaction of the Striatums. 
In order to back their theory, the economists in the researchers group in addition research on Nachverfolgung of money. 
In this case, three groups against a partner organizations had to bid under different conditions. 
The control group has been the true value of the product, then you have told their operations. 
A different group has also promised to 15 dollar reward in the case that they emerge as a winner of the game. 
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, in the event of a lost game also were lost. 
The difference between the two groups was then only in that the emphasis in the one on the win, while the other was at the losing. 
As evidence of the hypothesis Neurologen expressed but were members of the "against the losing" group on the extent prepared to higher operations than those in the control or the '' improvement group. 
"This results fall of any previous economic theory. 
They have studied the behaviour in auctions so far, only with the pleasure about the win, or the risk avoidance is justified. 
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved, thanks to the imaging neurological processes, and that we now have a third statement in place ", said Andrew Schotter, professor of economic faculty of the University of New York.
