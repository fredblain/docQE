With the victory on the flat course in 2: 03: 59, Gebrselassie his previous result of 2: 04: 26 in order to improve 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has his 26 world record in his versatile career in which he sets up on every route from one kilometre until the marathon Weltmeisterschaftstitel reached or at least one set a world record. 
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, for fear that the hindsight perhaps exaggerated was that the pollution could aggravate his asthma problems. 
Instead he has registered for the race in Berlin. 
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees on goal, Gebrselassie - with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.

"everything is perfect. 
I have the training a week ago resumed and still had some concerns, but at the end of what is super. " 
He was criticised in Kenya, Ethiopia - particularly from East Africa rivals - that he too many of his Rennläufe orchestriert weltbeste Marathonstars in general, however, leaves too much on the Rennanführer, as if that would be a Bahnrennen, and world records on the race.

Accompanied by four Kenyans Gebrselassie on Sunday was the centre of the line in 1: 02: 04. 
Two Eliteläufer from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi Gebrselassie have still require after the Tempomacher had subsided. 
A little more than three miles from the Finish Gebrselassie has made his last office in order to separate themselves from Kwambai, the second in 2: 05: 36 arrived and so its Bestzeit has improved by almost 5 minutes. 
Kamathi was third in 2: 07: 48.

Last spring, the 36 years old Mikitenko surprising the London marathon in 2: 24: 14. 
She has missed the Games in Beijing because of problems which have been described as a back injury. It has, however, recovered, in order to win in Berlin and their Bestzeit, in its third marathon to improve by five minutes. 
She has scheduled its course, cleverly, by a Quartet from Ethiopian and Kenyan Läuferinnen ausreissen, but only after 30 kilometres outdated.
