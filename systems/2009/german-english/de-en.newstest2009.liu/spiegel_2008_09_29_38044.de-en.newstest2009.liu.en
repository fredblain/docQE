The secrets of bento-box Sylvana. 
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of the Tachibana Highschool, will present the girl to catch kichern, the German is total "Kawaii"! 
What that means? 
Sylvana Mangas already knows from the floor in the new austausch-log told - by Japan. 
"the first day of school in Japan. 
I was excited. 
I had before the Bammel Schulweg. 
I live on the edge Tokios Kawasaki and drive in the direction of 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool. 
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I did not intervene. 
At the beginning of the teaching Tachibana seems not so strictly defined as at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils from 8 p. m., a tumble by about twenty nine a brief Besprechungsrunde with the teacher begins, the home room. '' 
But before the teaching began, I was present in the series, me. 
I am also is not the type, the happy to speak before people, a class of 40 pupils. 
Because I have not had Schuluniform, I have an old rock attracted to my Gastmutter Bluse Kniestr√ºmpfe, blue and black leather shoes. 
In this lift so I did before the bench and tried to put things right where she Sayonara to say: '' - I would like... Sylvana Sylvana, come from Germany and voted in a week of birthday. 
In the moment, I was very happy that I have more than two years ago, had begun to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class have all gewunken getuschelt sniggering and constantly, and I have heard the word "Kawaii". 
The knew I had from my Mangas. 
It is part of the vital importance of Japanese girls and means done her rhetoric, sweet ''. 
Then I am quickly gehuscht at my place. 
The girls beside me has been widely gegrinst, you thought it was an honour that the exchange should be sitting next to her schoolgirl. 
The rest of the hour was fairly calm, but as the Gong message drummed out, I was absolutely bombarded. 
All talked to me and asked kicherten confusion and holes in the gut - it is really difficult to understand, Japanese English. 
In the break from their Bentos packten all then. 
My Gastmutter as a lunchbox had also made me - that is something other than the tedious German Pausenbrote. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages from cucumbers and algae, salad, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. 
Mostly I have not got a clue what exactly I am here in Japan. 
The matter is strange and lunch entirely novel. 
It is clear that everything is truly lecker. 
Well that, with the exception perhaps also lodged salzig brrrr! 
The Bentos in Japanese schools are not only easy lunch. 
It is sometimes that a girl a young a suicide zubereitetes Bento, which they then pays particularly skilful herrichtet - in the hope that the young in the Pausensnack closer. 
I read in my manga-comics. 
I am once eager to find out whether I can see that here too. 
Why Japan? '', because all my friends have asked me when I told them that I, for one year in Tokyo wants to go to school. 
I have always said. 
"because it fascinates me time." 
I read for many years, ideally Mangas. 
And the comic strip and so I understand the culture is better at some point, I have also started to learn a bit in Japanese. 
For me was absolutely clear that I had to travel here at some point. 
Because I also have a penchant for tradition, customs and behaviours. 
And, it sets great store here. 
On one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditionally. 
And because everything is so well organised, I have also felt here, not yet lost, although Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen. "
