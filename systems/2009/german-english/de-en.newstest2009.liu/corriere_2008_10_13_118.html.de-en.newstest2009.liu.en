The walls goes up in Superkleber leaves 
The forces of heavy thanks to a Klebstoffes hochklettern and the walls to be able to defeat as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now apparently has reached almost there. 
In an area with a mob of only 2.5 qcm Kleber, the researchers produced a 100 kg of serious body to peg on a senkrechten wall. 
The studio has an American magazine, the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the air force published research laboratory. 
The material invented by the research team is a further development of already used in glues, what a particular carbon structure, known as kohlenstoff-nanoröhrchen, use. 
"the principle of Klebers you can feel like a number to a batch of spaghetti angeordneter piping Zhong Lin imagine", says Mr Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists did of the feet of inspiration Geckos, which is covered by mikroskopischen Härchen, a perfect stop the animal. 
The with various materials such as glass of Teflon and cutting paper conducted tests have shown that the new Kleber ten times more than the Haltefähigkeit the feet of the reptiles and at the same time away from the Wall "easily", so Liming Dai leaves, researchers in the school of engineering sciences at the University of Dayton. 
On walls along walking? "this material could be used as deciduous glue 'presupposes, Liming Dai. 
On walls around like Spiderman emporzugehen? perhaps, but the researchers think more reminiscent of a less fascinating benefits, such as the link of electrical appliances, because the Nanoröhrchen are just as head of heat and electricity. 
Other areas of application could be in the field of space. 
For the moment, so the Superhelden must still have to wait. 
The other type of research, the University of Berkeley, California, to a new Kleberart. 
In an article in the American chemical society the Californian researchers present a glue from Mikrofasern like hair by movement on a surface of the dust cleaning and this has been a perfect liability.
