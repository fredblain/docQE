Free opinion - the Orwellian talk of Barrick gold 
In its edition of 17 September Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, vize-generaldirektor Barrick gold of the Canadian gold mine. 
This confirms this, and followed an Orwellian logic that the biggest goldgewinnungs society in the world a libel case on six million against three authors and a small mittelloses Publications Service sought, with the goal of being a '' to open public debate. 
If it is true that the judges independent and impartial judgments, then you are not on the truth, especially not in the case of smear lament, but about the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver. 
Because of Barrick gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, everyone in the business who dares to drive, one of the their opposite view. 
No matter how the process, the authors and the editor of the book States Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight the from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine are paid. 
The tactics in this unequal fight is in fact often, the defenders to ruin an amicable settlement in order to force the opposing side to silence the power and furthermore who dares to dissuade again at the question. 
If Barrick gold really wanted to a public debate, she would have their view of things must present in the face of public opinion. 
Contrary to what many of the countries in which works, Barrick gold, are usually in Canada debates by the exchange of ideas and not by Knüppelhiebe. 
This could have been enough unless the gold mine their books and files to the table and a real debate would have opened up by the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent Prüfteams, would have the light on this issue. 
But Barrick gold seems no confidence in the public opinion aside, and to the petitions and letters in support of the authors from States Canada with a snap of his fingers to one side. 
Could perhaps Mr Garver explain how he make an 'public' debate but can ask the opinions of the same public contempt? 
Apparently includes the word in the world of Vice-President just the generous paid lawyers, and not the Community of Canadians; a very nice beengte view of the concept. 
In a democracy of the detractors have the right to speak. 
Does not understand what Barrick gold - or do not want to understand - is that the public, the authors and publishers of States, Canada supports doing it, particularly because they opposed the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
This public is prepared to do so, Barrick listen and to judge, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework, whom many perceive as knebel-klage (in the course of the '' public debate Barrick gold has just made a call to the authors from States Canada, in which she asked of them not to use the term...). 
In addition to the surreal speech by Mr Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct assault on the freedom to academic research and the truth, it is an essential component of any democratic society. 
It denies absolutely the right to quote from credible sources and about facts and interpretations to discuss, form the basis of the intellectual work. 
If it in a country like Canada is impossible to investigate and issues to discuss, the rich companies of this world, who else will be able to do? 
If Barrick gold really wanted to a public and open debate, could lead them by the scientific standards, the authors of States Canada have been used. 
She has a right to reply. 
The university environment to which we belong, White for a long time, debates and disagreements over control and to resolve conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold clearly shows that, contrary to what they claim, no desire to a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the Universitätswelt, as well as for public debate, and it is time for the governments to take action to limit this type of unwarranted lawsuits.
