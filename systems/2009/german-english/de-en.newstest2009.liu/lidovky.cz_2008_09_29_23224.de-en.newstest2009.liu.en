The Sudeten demanded a referendum by the United States. 
The Sudeten Germans had in 1945 at the affiliation of the Böhmerwaldes asked to the United States. 
This is from a letter in the collections, the Südböhmischen scientific library is being stored. 
If we are not part of Germany and Austria, so we want to be at least under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With such a desire should be 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans have written to the US President. 
This is, among other things, from a letter in a private archive has been preserved and the today in the proceedings of the Südböhmischen scientific library will be retained. 
The German of Krumau ask the American presidents in the letter that he should the return of the '' Sudetengaus - on the basis of the Munich Agreement of Hitler was taken to the Czechoslovakia. 
"We have understood and the situation we really want to be sure that, in the words of the American units not as oppressors and enemies German territory, but as liberators", it says in a letter, with the words "people, which the fate of Sudeten hearts' sign. 
Since the end of the Czechoslovakia - the Sudeten Germans in knowledge of the Czech national character - suggests that it brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery would expect the author of the letter to ask the American President, for today and continue to hold the protection to take control of the Bohemian Forest. 
"We cannot believe that, without regard for the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area a grant for US foreign state, minority and trying to remove and nothing has contributed to the victory of the Allies' is the letter to read. 
The reason why the authors can not sign is supposed to be the fear of Rachegelüsten "the Czech oppressors". 
If the US President, doubts about the affiliation of Bohemian Forest, whether there is enough German harbour in Böhmerwaldgau if he would initiate a referendum on whether the inhabitants are part of the United States or under the protection of the United States wanted to live. 
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of the post-war world may sound a little naïve, but he has a good eye witnesses, according to some picture of what was then the expectations of the Sudeten Germans. 
Even if the Bohemian German at least guessed that I have had to negotiate their removal from the Republic would, just a few of them stood at all such a possibility. 
Some waited for the United States and Britain for Sudeten would negotiate a kind of autonomy. 
Others believed that they could simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The also confirms the famous Austrian journalist from Budweis, Gustav Chalupa dates. 
He was in the war as Budweiser German in the navy, on the Baltic Sea. 
At the end of the war when he was in British captivity and it into a war prison camp after Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian German came to him that he should teach you Czech. 
"They believed that if you heimkämen, would put them to the Czech Republic", so Chalupa passe. 
No one of the German prisoners of war, before the war in Czechoslovakia had lived in his view, so that it on the basis of the bene-dekrete from the Republic would drive.
