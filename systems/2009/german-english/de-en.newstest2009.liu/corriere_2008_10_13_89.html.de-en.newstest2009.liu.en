The elite is in danger of 
The phenomenon had already revealed a few days than the Chamber of Deputies, committing against the $700 billion dollar sparpaket of the White House agreed: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing, the Wall Street than to save the economy. 
Confirmed that yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reported back, such as the crisis in the Republican Party Laufschritt that is increasingly divided in their old divides and moderate East coast-seele, which is always the state institutions, and the business community, and the neoconservative, 'those in Washington, "and the financial sector, and particularly hostile to the south and the centre of the States electorate. 
This part of the Party owes his rise of V. a. the voice of the I referred to above. 
This aforementioned example, however, is only a small part of the great changes that will announce the current economic earthquake or even already represents: not only in the United States, including throughout the West, and perhaps even on this, this will be affected. 
Both in the States and in Europe, it seems that the crisis to speed up the long feared events, which under this new conditions finally take shape and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the recent discovery, the outrageous renaissance of the State in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
In fact means the crisis a decline of the banking and financial institutions, which have close links to the abroad and at the same time a tremendous amount of the assets of private individuals who manage to live in a single state. 
This means a direct political problem for the governments: as to the affected families to behaviour, which is also an enormous W채hlermasse. 
The crisis seems economically politically against global, it is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism would seem to be put to one side and his freedom of speech to have lost: the obvious proof has been given by the EU which, because of their division in various national and international conflicts to find no common way. 
So all now count with the intrusion of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and B. a. distribution of relief funds: since the crisis was always more seriously, only the United States in the economic situation without foreign aid to save. 
And, in addition to the resources they have also the legitimacy of using them, therefore, two not to 체berwertende conditions under certain circumstances, in what otherwise have no international organisation and a market could be in a similar way. 
The new emphasis on the staatlich- national element, is also in perfectly compatible with the growing importance, the recently in the economy with a closely related sector is implicated: the territoriality. 
More paradoxical way, it is just now than we were so convinced, however, long in a networked Gesamtreich to be entered into an empire of the increasingly sophisticated technologies, of the intangible that we need to establish our future, as more and more from the essential material things will depend, of water, harvest and oil. 
They can certainly all from one place to the rest of the world, but are yet to be transported to extreme with a closely linked a territory umschriebenen piece of earth. 
The person who is therefore on such a territory, a towards others in an ernteertraglosen wasserlosen or oil, free area lives, the advantage. 
I come to the second novelty, but a brief insertion. 
Who territory, who government policy says, who also says that leadership. 
In that sense, I think that the financial crisis to produce two converging phenomena. 
One hand there is the knowledge about the need for distinguished Leaderships, the need for someone who knows how to regulate the things. 
On the other side there is now a wave of indignation at the current leaders, particularly those of the economy, which turns as inadequate and full of Schattenzonen. 
In addition to a more far-reaching and in some ways even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, a impatience, a picture of the futility, a sense of distance, which is all to a whole class of managers of the Western countries. 
It seems so the conviction among large sections of the population solution that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but their Ideenwelt, their way of life, their culture in the broad sense of the word, whose content, whether the majority always as a foreign and outdated. 
The demand for leadership so cultivating a diverse underground but powerful movement and the removal of the leaders of the traditional political establishment. This is manifest in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in unvermittelten collective emotions swing in the state of the last time, starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, the rebellion of the American Members against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the rights also plays a role in Italy here). 
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also its observance, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value in terms of what today in the bottom of the social strata of the West, and reinforced by the financial crisis and to 체berdimensionalit채t ambitions. 
Given all this, it would be too much of a "rebellion of mass" to speak. 
The eyes but far to keep an open mind, however, is certainly not.
