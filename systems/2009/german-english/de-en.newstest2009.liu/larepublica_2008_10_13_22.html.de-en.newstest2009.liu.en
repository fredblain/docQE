If the energy from the waves, are suddenly on the great 
It is a not versiegende source of money, what about 70% of the surface of the planet and only now that the big energy companies seem to understand the world. 
Tidal currents and waves are the new renewable sources of energy are all on the now, and also seek to occupy, such as giants like Chevron. 
The possibility of energy from the movements of the sea to win for 70 years, is already being investigated and take into consideration; not by coincidence more vigorous these studies since the first oil crisis significantly. 
As the price of oil in 1980 vergas to slow the idea of marine energy, but now pressing the environmental organisations and the increase in the price of oil on new impetus in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London, estimates that 15% of the world's energy of the energy produced by the ocean waves could be covered. 
This is double the energy produced by nuclear reactors at the moment. 
What would come in addition to the currents and tides. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first company, now on the marine energy, is Enersis in 2005 a treaty for the construction of a power plant in the north Portugal has signed. 
As this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step to act. 
Two years later, there are now more firms from the traditional energy industry, which for the marine energy production. 
"Chevron examines these technologies" as the spokesman of one of the American giants well-known company in the Wall Street Journal the possibility and will cooperate with us. " 
This is the creation of a licence from the American energy Commission needed a project to launch off the coast of Alaska. 
This is a not to be underestimated sign, particularly when you consider that just continue to fuel in Alaska is promoted by the United States and President Bush recently even the plans for new Bohrungen set in motion. 
In addition to Chevron are also the firms Verdant power Inc. from New York and Ocean power from New Jersey who invest in the new industry. Are also not familiar with the details, but observers speak of a rising interest. 
Still leaves technologies. 
Experts speak of a departure was still in the adoption of technology, not least because there is not yet the last doubt from the environmentalists are clarified. 
So far, projects such as the one in Portugal and Scotland seem rather small dimension and no serious ecological causing problems. 
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, we need technologies with far greater impact on the environment. 
There are various possibilities: Ocean power around uses a system of related Bojen. 
The boost of the waves, which moved up and down, Bojen within the swimmer will magically appear on Kolben and converted in hydraulischen pressure. 
This drives a Turbine, which in turn is pursuing a generator. 
The electricity will be on the coast under water pipes. 
Until now, there are four planned plant of its kind, which is still waiting for permission to the state. A part of its energy could also serve for military facilities. 
However, Verdant power produced already energy for a Warenkaufhaus and a Parklatz through unterseeischer turbines in the East river from New York. 
The water movements during the tidal forces turbines in which the emerging Drehbewegung feeds the generator. 
According to the Verdant waiting for a long queue of potential clients on the necessary Autorisierungen in order to make use of this energy sources. 
But the waves, then the tides. 
A particular interest, according to the Institute deserves the potential for stromgewinnungs research at the moment, which in the tides. 
Even though it is a phenomenon, unregelmäßiges are extremely unpredictable, but better than the tides, the sun Windströmungen and also of the waves, and therefore a trust more worthy source of electricity. 
It is the tidal energy, it is the federal states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal States, have already expressed about 7.5 million dollars to invest in 2008 for 2009 are already up to 35 million planned.
