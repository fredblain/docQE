'' I am picking up the masters behind the stage, in order to maintain his character, Günter Brauer, photographer. 
No paragraphs, no Rüsche Kostüme, not for the appearance. 
The nature of the great Flamenco dancers, the concentration and attention from the interpretation for a entspanntes appearance as a woman or a man. 
One artist 
On the other hand personality 
I am looking into private life, these moments are alien for the audience, I know that when I for the personality characteristic gesture, the depth of a stolen or vision ausdrück strength of the hands, which are concerned, because they are not the entrance, can be found. 
In his project 'flamenco- people, the German photographer Günter Bauer abwechselungs rich drama typical of some gatherings on the stage with singer, dancer at and Gitarristen. From this side he was still little known for artists. 
With this proposal creates the photographer of a special Ikonografie Flamenco presentation at different levels. 
The exhibition on the programme of the month, which is one of the photograph of Flamenco 'reflects the international importance of Flamenco by the day to day is increasing, "said of artists and makes clear that' flamenco- people '' any human being can be, but if you look at the photographs, so does the observer that there was no typical images of artists on the stage. 
Ordinary people on the portrait are artists, who are capable of on the stage passion, sadness, happiness, and to get to move so that the audience. 
The personality of these artists record, they do not need to photographs on the stage. 
Their personality and character is in their hearts. 
As far as I am interested was to create a personal atmosphere, which would allow me to the people of the biggest Flamenco Fotokamera master it. '' 
Bauer, inspired by the festival '' Minas Cante de las, made in 1997 on a long journey, in order, a singer and dancer at Gitaristen or attempting to photograph with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the Bildsortierungsfunktion of the camera, and the existing material created in images to remind traditional photograph. 
The application of different stylistic resources destroying the traditional base of the image, so that the picture modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands, Flamenco: 'be given music with traditional roots, the changed and surprised every day.' ' 
This is not only the dance, the song or the Instrumentalspiel itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, the audience with its art. 
The search for the essential, after some something that exists in the form of Hörens, the existence is to be visible and was the firm objective of this work in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata is presented. 
Well-known figures in Diego El Cigala Flamenco among them, Lobato Chano, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente crony and others belong to a tight selection of nearly 70 artists who have been photographed. 
The project became one of the Anthologie Flamencos, and it will soon be in book form, with all the portrait from the exhibition. 
Bauer's passion to the portrait, this idea led him to take up to two years ago and as' 'a portrait of veterans of the sport to achieve sportartproject (' '). 
Although the concepts of the project 'flamenco- people are different, the photographer to' it gives me great, people are attempting to photograph, you get to know and to put in their living situation, whether for a brief moment or a longer period of time. 
I think that, in the field of photograph the portrait is the most difficult species. 
Du triffst you or faces of people's personalities, sometimes not at all kennst, or they leave you alone for a few minutes in order to be able to make a photograph. 
In addition to these circumstances as a photographer, I always try to achieve my ideas. '' 
The collection of the portrait of the Flamencos of today with the title 'flamenco- people' 'is in the gallery of El Fotómata issued in the street, with the name of La Calle de la Mata and parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition you can visit until 16 October.
