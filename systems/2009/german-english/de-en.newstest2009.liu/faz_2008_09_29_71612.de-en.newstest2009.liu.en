Düsseldorfer hopes to Frankfurt 
In big words are lacking in the letter of the westlb- board of directors to the staff of the House. 
By bringing together units of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstituts with the Frankfurt could deka-bank Sparkassen- Kapitalmarkthaus "at the heart of the financial group", it says in the letter reported on Monday. 
The WestLB Kompetenzblock would result in a '' with sustainable profitability in such a deal. 
And could such a link the decisive push to further Bündelungen banking sector in the country. 
If so, it is more difficult time a board wants to demonstrate ability to act. 
Because the ailing WestLB is still under enormous pressure. 
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for financial services supervision, the national government of Westphalia nordrhein- has made it clear recently that the time is pushing to find a solution for the future. 
As sort of a link between the deka-bank, the savings for their clients, and the WestLB Investmentsfonds know for some time, however, is already the speech, also at Frankfurt side. 
Although deka-bank-chef Franz Waas during the presentation of the half-yearly figures at the end of August, know that in a merger of the House to the highway with a Landesbank Mainzer, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he see no sense. 
But the Board of the Deka, the ever at half of the country, banks and savings banks associations, the board, charged with the WestLB talks on joint business activities. 
Yet it would order marktgeschäft and parts of the capital. 
The talks have, of course, it has only just begun on financial centre. 
The deka-bank who, with their 3,000 staff, one of the most important employers in the city of Frankfurt, is not the first time, the speech, when it comes to consolidation in the savings banks sector. 
In 2003 it for a moment as possible with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz deka-bank and merging the Helaba. 
This is Dreierbund, however, it was nothing. 
Hardly had the plans has become public, the Hessische provincial government against the participation of Helaba point. 
The two other homes were not each other. 
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. 
But it has repeatedly thought about a combination of deka-bank with regional banks. 
Most recently, however, Günther, managing director of the Helaba Merl, against overstatement about a conjunction with his house. 
Regardless of tyres but seems to recognize that a move together the various houses of the public sector is needed. 
Now that the Landtagswahl in Bayern is over, can be the first with a combination of bayernlb Landesbank Baden-Württemberg closer. 
For the Helaba is that is not necessarily good news. 
The pressure to further mergers should rise gradually, they are in favour of the partners. 
In the south, they would be confined junior partner, the financial crisis so far, even though they were much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A engagement with the West LB has, in turn, the Sparkassen- Giroverband hessen-thüringen, and with 85 percent of the Helaba is involved, at the beginning of the year, a barrier. 
If anything, the North LB would remain. 
Such strategic considerations, but only one side of the coin. 
On the other, there is the question of how different business models of the individual houses link up with each other. 
In June, Merl, the key question, what is the business model of the future capacity of the country banks should be guaranteed, and by the German Sparkassen- Giroverband has not been answered. 
At the end could also be an disassembly of the West LB, but there are, of course, is not wanted. 
It is in the letter of the board of directors said, it will certainly an "overall solution" for the House. 
As is the case with the convergence of individual units with the deka-bank under one roof, only time will tell.
