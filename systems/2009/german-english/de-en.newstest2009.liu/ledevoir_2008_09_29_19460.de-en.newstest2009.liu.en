Letter - a entehrtes country 
Mr Vic Toews, '' justice exported (how ironic) -minister of the cabinet Harper was the last summer about Louise Arbour, allowed to say that it is a '' outrageous for Canada. 
This woman, an interminable struggle for justice has produced, and deserves all our admiration, so with outrage on cigarette packs, says as much about the people from around the Prime Minister, as on Stephen Parker itself. 
We are dealing with a government, as the only for all the affected countries to their Guantanamo prisoners in concentration camps not countryman has taken home. 
A government that not even into account that Omar Khadr was still a young man who crossed the things, which he accused of. 
The only government, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaking its word and a child soldier to languish under inhuman conditions. 
The only one who is on a justice parody herabl√§sst in order to assess the fault of the defendants. 
We should remember that, especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers argue, Omar Khadr to bring home so that he gets a fair trial in Canada. 
This is exactly the government also closes its eyes to the torture: they are more interested in little that a young adults after so many years of an ordeal will for ever be mentally broken. 
We are not yet aware, but we are seeing here is the insidious curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our '' democracy Harper, this word, which constantly as a flag, and that from his mouth sounds so noncommittal. 
It is therefore the time has come, where there could be no morality is no longer a Canadian citizens, we can arbitrarily imprison, torture and abuse, quite as they see fit of a government until today, which is supported only by the minority (let him after the 14 October are quite on the minority...). 
Many voters believe that their salvation in a party to find the champions virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government is broken by the what the reputation and represented the dignity of our country. 
The disgrace, Mr Toews, lies in this Lossagung, and nowhere else.
