Debate on bilingual education education in English language environment. 
In this edition of the "education watch" debate, Bruce Fuller and lance T. Izumi, the positions of the candidates for the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, senior scientific staff in Kalifonischen studies and senior director in their specialised field education sciences in the Pacific research institute for public policy, is a co-author of the book "not as good as you might think, why the middle class a school selection needs". 
The address Hispanic voters is a complicated task. 
Barrack Obama proposals on the subject of education are a case in point. 
"The Obama campaign said, the likelihood Afro-amerikanischen and Hispanic pupils at the school, a successful conclusion is lower than in white pupils' - and what is true. 
This performance gap to close Bildungsplan specifically from other Obama recommends a bilingual footnote in the training for those who only learn English. 
Still, there is the question to Obama, is whether his commitment to the bilingual training, focused on teaching in languages other than English, his interest is contrary to the distance in the school performance. 
A good example of '' Sixth street "preparatory conference", a primary school in East Los Angeles. 
The majority of the pupils are hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. 
More than a third of students, many of which are just recently in the country, learning English. 
However, in 2008, amazing 100 per cent pupils of the fourth class the State test in Mathe insisted on the right level. 
Also surprising, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year in the English test as well. 
This amazing success was achieved through other methods, than those who are preferred by Obama. 
The school Sixth street bases its focus to review and exercise at constant control of knowledge and an attitude that no exceptions should be tolerated. 
The school practises in addition to the approach after the training in an English-speaking environment. This is precisely the point that Obama is expected to consider the school leader Linda Mikels. 
This approach stresses the importance of the almost ausschlies in the use of English slichen Fachunterricht. 
Mrs Mikels, rejects the idea zweisprachiger training, said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil, the only about from Mexico 12 months later. Klassenraum would be to enter and will not be able to see again. 
"It works", realised to you, "it will work for us". 
A school would Obama as the '' Sixth street "preparatory conference" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English students pupils? 
The services of school were the answer to that question lightly, but the educational policy positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support the idea zweisprachiger training for a long time) and his own consistent support of bilingual training to make predictions about Obama answer uncertain. 
While he agrees to the point that immigrants need to learn English, he has trivialized the subject recently when he said that people should stop of concerns about on "only English" gathering legislation. 
Instead, he said: "they should ensure that their child" in Spanish. 
If Obama wants to close the performance gap actually carefully educational models, they should take into account the operation, rather than to trivialize and knock.
