In a first tranche is a maximum of half of the 700-milliarden-betrages 250 billion will be spent, and are available immediately after the Congress as expected on Monday will vote on the issue. This sum is credit for the purchase of contaminated, poor securities will be spent, and the other is $100 billion the President decide.

A cut in salaries, there will be only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance aushilft respectively. 
The reduction in essence means that if the department as part of an auction buying, '' the golden Handshake is taxed, unless the outgoing Bankenchef will go to the retirement. 
In the event of a direct purchases of bad loans is the government's aggressive play to ensure that the managers' salaries should not be exaggerated. 
The picture is that the existing golden handshake- contracts are not changed - the restrictions only pertains to new agreements so that all the more people to take part in the programme.
