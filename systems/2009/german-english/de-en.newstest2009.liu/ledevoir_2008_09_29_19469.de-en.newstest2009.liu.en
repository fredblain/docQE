Meeting - from the blood that, once, of course, was 
Hema-quebec yesterday was celebrating the 10th anniversary of its creation, and its President, Dr Mrs Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because hema-quebec is one of the safest and most effective blood banks of the world. 
And, above all, it has gained the confidence of the public by the scandal by the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s, was considerably shaken. 
As we know, were the donated blood service of the Canadian Red Cross national Blutreserven administered during the 1980s with HIV and Hepatitis c-virus contaminated. 
In light of this drama and the public discontent led the Canadian government in February 1994, a public, by the judge Horace Krever mounted an investigation, it aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and directives for a new disaster to prevent this type. 
While judge Krever, his report still hesitated to make several provinces at the time, asked a Committee on the legs, whose aim was to a new system for managing blood to develop in Canada. 
The Committee met in Quebec Gélineau this mission. 
After the reports of Gélineau Krever, and two blood banks: founded in Canada for hema-quebec Quebec is responsible, and the Canadian Blutgesellschaft, about the other provinces and the two territories. 
Hema-quebec '1998, their work has included 38% of the people had very little faith in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr Décary. 
The situation was dispiriting. 
By the enormous efforts in order to improve the safety of the blood and through the work in this area during the next year, we have won the confidence of the public, it says, before you proud stressed that the beginning of 2008 now almost 94% of the population hema-quebec had confidence in Quebec. 
However, Dr Décary 'confidence in the knowledge that something is extremely fragile.' ' 
Since its creation on 28 September 1998 hema-quebec is following the principle of caution. 
At this time, we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe with a new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, told this woman since the creation of 1998, which holds the leadership. 
'' and we have not had the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted by blood. 
So we invoked one of the main directives of the reports and Gélineau Krever, according to one exclusion measures, if we did not know and if a disease only slowly, as it seems, in the case of the disease is caused by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death. 
In April 1999, so it was no blood of people who are since 1980, more than a month in the United Kingdom had stopped. 
Now, a few years ago, without any doubt, demonstrated that the disease transmitted by blood. 
This event has shown us that the principle of caution that we, the sense of rigid. 
In 1999 on the market seemed a much more precise technology to detect HIV: the nukleinsäure-tests (NST), which will make it directly in the blood of the donor to prove the existence of the virus itself, and it is not the antibodies against the virus, like the hitherto tests of the case. 
The NST enabled to shorten the incubation period, between the time the person was infected and, if the first viruses through our techniques can be found in the blood, states the specialist, is taking place. 
This time, to a period of less than a week will be reduced. 
It was the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it, and we could not see substantially reduced. 
These improvements enabled, the risk of AIDS through a blood transfusion, to a considerable extent to transfer to lower them. 
Today there is a risk of 12 million people with HIV infected blood. 
"in other words, that means that we should distribute 12 million blood before someone infected with HIV. 
As hema-quebec every year between 400 and 500 000 blood, I would be distributed more than 24 years before a case in which HIV acts on a Blutkonserve. 
I believe that we are now in the process, if you can feel comfortable receiving a blood transfusion or wants to restore the health ', says the head of direktions by hema-quebec. 
'' our challenge for the next 10 years, the safety of our products. 
One never knows what pathogens can reach into the system. 
Only last year at the reunion is the appeared, the chikungunya-virus, just as the westnil-virus, by insects on the blood is transferred. 
We must monitor driving continuously, Dr Décary continued, before she points out that hema-quebec alongside a safe supply in addition to provide an adequate supply. 
"The demand is rising, because the population is getting older. 
Since the treatments are more aggressive cancer patients often need or new red blood cells, platelets. 
The ageing population also has an impact on the Blutspendernetz, to an average of only 3% of the donations appropriate natives of Quebec. ' 
It is every healthy man, the 18 years or older, and the eligibility criteria are met, all 56 days, six times a year, blood donations. 
On average 14% of the people who their blood available, not accepted because they, for example, of AIDS or malaria, and anyone who has travelled in a country where malaria is endemic, will be excluded from the donations for a year. 
'with these 3% we make it an inventory to that meets the needs of the hospitals. 
A lack of stockpiles are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of the donor network, as they grow older and no blood more donations. 
It is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and encourage them to make regular donors. 
The life today is so hectic that it is seldom finds the time to spend an hour in the blood, '' Mrs Francine Décary regrets. 
With an annual budget of $297 million hema-quebec provides not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin, almost exclusively with serious fire violations is used. 
These tissues are frozen, processed and investigated before they can be stored with hema-quebec, which is also the only public umbilical cord blood bank Quebec managed. 
In the umbilical cord that previously had been seen as a biomedical waste, is also on stem cells rich blood which could help serious diseases, such as leukaemia, to deal with. 
'' a few weeks ago, we celebrated our tausendsten stored umbilical cord sample, and we plan to buy more than a thousand a year. 
"I suppose we should start at the beginning of next year, it is available for transplants, says Dr Décary on this programme of Nabelschnurblut- describes as a loss very popular. 
'many mothers are convinced, to have no access to it, because hema-quebec lack funding, this complex and expensive programme in all hospitals to offer Quebec.
