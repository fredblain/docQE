<seg id="1"> Duel on knife edge: MP3-Player against cellular phones. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> We recommend you by your election </seg>
<seg id="3"> , While each cellular phone MP3-Dateien can almost play no MP3-Player can still telephone. </seg>
<seg id="4"> From then on he naturally sees according to end that there are good of, himself to buy only a telephone. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Why despite everything there are sufficiently reasons in contrast, one shall adopt an autonomous player. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The election all hangs the future from the way of the use and the entitlements properties as of. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Certainly one buys with difficulty himself for at home a great expensive recordplayer, in order himself it to listen to the new album from Maxim Turbulenc. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Once it also in contrast appears musical novelties not on LPs, out of qualitative visibility give he no objective reason. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Have you however LPs with way skirt, you dream probably at least from a such jazz or blues in shelf,. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So that is also with the music on rice, well, with komprimierter music simplify expressed -- music in MP3-Format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also here there are price-- and quality categories. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For the someone perhaps not likewise he satisfactory, for a player of 8000 crowns to handle, however a Pink-Floyd-Fan profit with difficulty earpieces for twenty crowns of market supports. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Two extreme, between who there are sufficiently space for each. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The choice is gefächert great. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Also the life duration of the batteries is decisive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some good Music player can much more cannot as only music, however the, to know what cellular phones cellular phones, they delete not even hint way. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern appliance is thus universal to start like the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Next to the crucial functions, what and telefonieren that cornices, he can reproduce music and of video, to take both, he once has a good, paint a bad camera and perhaps also cannot. </seg>
<seg id="19"> , And if one still includes the Smartphons and Kommunikatoren one almost a small computer in the bag. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is a small miracle, thus no refrigerator and barbecues no television fotografieren. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Yes the Universalität of the cellular phones also brings disadvantages with himself. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Per more functions you on your cellular phone take hold, all the more frequent will mustn't however nachladen you he. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the abspielen from music is a the tall Energiefresser. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Only few cellular phones more than zehn-zwölf to play hours, most of the time he much less know music. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this consideration Music players (special the easy) effective distinctly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Therefore you shall expect it by the cellular inexpensive phones, that not they long when hours music can play a pair. </seg>
<seg id="27"> , If you then telephone as of and at still you still buy preferably himself to security for an drawer appliance fürs office-- also passes for expensive appliance. </seg>
<seg id="28"> By MP3-Playern do not get you this problem who few good stops at least 9 hours non-stop enterprise aufladen with a time out of. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> A large problem then exists, if one likes überspielen the music on cellular phone. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately only a minimal part of the appliances over someone arranges USB-Abschluss, moreover each cellular phone without special software does not look direct at a PC plug in. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Naturally one knows überspielen directly the music on a memory media, thus only few card readers without reduction ready with the minuscule memory cards, the in cellular phones use development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> By players you need no special software except exceptions( iPod). </seg>
<seg id="33"> They need only to feed the appliance over USB-Port with music out of your PC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The cellular many phones and of players even put a music library on, tidied after the name of the Interpreten, the title of the album, the gender or of for example the evaluation through users. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some appliances only the tree pattern of the address directory the, similar the Windows Explorer, many both( iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephone with operating system). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Players are easy to serve, cellular phone more know </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Concrete by the choice of someone appliances you himself the in particular after the life duration accumulators, who and naturally also memory capacity, the quality and that type the sound the Bedienkomfort erkundigen. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Above all and music wing hören you they each day for you only little for example in the tramway, then a cellular indifferent phone offers, the MP3-Dateien play. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What does really already almost each cellular phone know. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They must no longer check particular, what a cellular phone or a player can work music formats. </seg>
<seg id="41"> MP3 succeed all, and the many music, who you get, am just in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format belongs to widespread to the at many, and moreover knowhow who most also play appliances music WMA-Format in. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Fewer customary AAC (a format, the Apple and his use iPods). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Cellular good phones allow online equally the purchase from music. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One needs to call the corresponding sides of a supplier( or an other supplier) only over movable internet, and already one knows a song or album acquires. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Why this provision of services can already in contrast be an irrefutable argument at and for himself, one shall adopt a cellular phone. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately the supplier is badly the offer and most of the time only limits fast radio tubes. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The prices are no longer the low. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Generally though one leaves from it for, that in future just now this way the sale the music industry beherrschen from music( there is over GSM, internet or wireless internet). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> The many by himself carry the cellular phone. </seg>
<seg id="51"> If you have desire of, himself to listen to something, you take the cellular phone in the bag, during who players oversight at home is. </seg>
<seg id="52"> He arrives however it, whether you also carry always earpieces or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung by himself. </seg>
<seg id="53"> , Over who almost if you resort not, knowhow to the integrated loudspeaker each cellular phone arranges, however only the few MP3-Player. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The tall well advantage of the cellular phones will find for a lot in price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The inexpensive normally less cost crowns as 3000. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> For three -- and you already get 4000 crowns an all suitable Walkman. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The tall handicap will be for the many, that no normal earpieces in addition to. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The good and technical end mature esten telephones with someone of 3,5- mm-Öffnung for normal earpieces crowns cost until to 15000. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The advantage of the players anew finds in the light service. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The easy -- and not absolute inexpensive (look at choice)-- everybody can really serve players. </seg>
<seg id="61"> A minimum at functions, who the recordplayer is early or for example resemblance by the service with that normal cassette taperecorder visibly. </seg>
<seg id="62"> He then threatens enormous bill for data transmissions of no crash of hiring in form of someone erroneous movable internet and someone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> What appliance shall one now take </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> Also the cellular inexpensive phones( for example Vodafone 527) arrange Slot in the rule over someone for redeemable memory media( type M2, microSD u. ä.). </seg>
<seg id="65"> Even if nachkaufen you a corresponding card, 2000 pass crowns out of. </seg>

<seg id="67"> GB are supported only cards in the rule with a maximal capacity from 2 by the basis models. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the expensive can also read 8-GB-Speicherkarten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> If will already and still'll you a cellular phone besitzen himself a low-cost MP3-Player, then you take Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. </seg>
<seg id="70"> According to capacity( max. 2 GB) must then no longer put on as 1100 crowns on the table. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first potential supplier already comes in this year after the Czech Republic. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Perhaps </seg>
<seg id="3"> The telephony market in the Czech Republic is really mature, the Czech supplier practically offer provision of services to all, as also she offer from their partner in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> All the same something-- a potential supplier, who pressures the classic into low prices. here fails </seg>
<seg id="5"> Perhaps this one will let no longer long wait for himself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> That the Czech telephony suppliers work at all to the expensive in Europe, we have already often brought back on Mobil.cz to. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This moreover also confirmed TÚ, who attentive it to the telecommunications authorities, that the price is here SMS for someone high when the European European Union in rest realised. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the last steps he thus devolves probably to a paradoxical situation on the European commission in area regulation of the Roaminggebühren -- for plain customers of the Czech telephony suppliers SMS his as out of the stranger inexpensive at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> How does he arrive from, that the prices be thus in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe high? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is easy, he fails the competition, who really an struggle ansage power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Perhaps it ring paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there thus gives three telephony nets and a penetration from far away more than 100%. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The telephony suppliers curse gladly in contrast above, that he many competition on the Czech market extreme give. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The the chairman of the council of the Czech telecommunications authorities( TÚ) often also pflichtet ák Pavel Dvo to, by, who had often expressed in the past, that there are no place in the Czech Republic for a large supplier. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He probably ballots, that no longer have a classic supplier many chances with an own net particular( moreover he also hardly still find frequencies likely). </seg>
<seg id="15"> There are however still a possibility-- a potential supplier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Just now the entry of potential suppliers on the telephony market brought a clear price reduction with himself, on what the classic telephony suppliers mustn't then also react to. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Such in addition to there still gave before the entry enterprise as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile similar voices on the market in Great Britain in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="18"> He have however shown, that there are place for such suppliers and that this one can be successfully real. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Moreover one does not long after examples to look need. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In Feb we have reported over the departure of the potential supplier Mobilking in Poland this one. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In only an half year there succeeded this supplier, more to win and thus fünfgrößten customers suppliers the country as 100 thousand to rise. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Behind Mobilking the finance group Penta on top of that declares, who in the Czech Republic under other U: own fon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The advantage of potential suppliers consists in on top of that inside, that one can concentrate on a much concrete target. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order cannot work effective, potential suppliers namely need many few customer as a classic supplier. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They namely need no relative high expenses for the building, the enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the world the potential suppliers thus normally than Low-Cost-Firmen heraus stand out -- they offer inexpensive telephone talk and of SMS, what however often few bulky provision offer from someone accompanied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> So Tesco Mobile for example at least offers in Great Britain SMS around the half inexpensive as his competitor. </seg>
<seg id="28"> , As however the example from Mobilking shows in Poland cannot there also a really good failure train, on a to put on not stereotyped target. </seg>
<seg id="29"> This supplier namely addresses himself specific at men. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Authentic guys elect Mobilking -- who they can and trust supplier, who they please that", according to David Seibert, the CEO from the Mobile entertainment company, the operator enterprise of this potential supplier. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Difficult to say, how whether foot cannot also take a similar plan in Poland in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="32"> daran the press spokesman from Vodafone Miroslav also doubts epický: "The Czech market for a market segment, on who the many potential suppliers rest on, relative small. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Moreover he is saturated out of the visibility of the provision offer relative. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In the Czech Republic the telephony suppliers mean fate, </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> However almost sure sure, that, if a potential telephony supplier Czech Republic conquers, this not Mobilking. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "We indeed say this successful project from an expansion, despite everything in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particular optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="37"> He gets eher to an market entry from Mobilking in other countries of our area kommen ", so dissociates ková in a telephone talk for Mobil.cz Jana Studni of, press spokesman of the finance group Penta. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Indirect she thus certified, that not the current telephony suppliers this thought in the Czech Republic particular leant. </seg>
<seg id="39"> On the contrary </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Her interest at a departure of a potential telephony supplier already shows Novera, who liked like a large step, in order a real competitor enterprise customer from Telefónica O2 in area since long time to the group of GTS. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "We a tall interest daran, only to offer also provisions of services. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And per early, all the more improve. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Over this possibility had we with all Czech telephony suppliers negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="44"> With some from they we cannot already reach negotiation progresses ", thus who press spokesmen the group Pavel Kaidl. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Perhaps good times now come. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Out of not official information hervor go, that perhaps to wait the first potential supplier the year until end. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Up to now though this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of the silence. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "In this time we do not leave from it for, that place consist in the Czech Republic for a complete potential supplier. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market shows tall compared with other markets Spezifika. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Up to now no subject have still answered us project with a complex and thoughtful in this area", mean e in his explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr out of the press department from Telefónica O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> On the Spezifik of the Czech market large suppliers also indicate. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The press spokesman from T movable Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the explanation from O2: "Up to now we still found no viable and profitable beidseitig project, on what one cannot beyond build." </seg>
<seg id="53"> And she adds: "In net from T movable a potential supplier will hardly emerge until end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="54"> In this time we mustn't already have a concrete offer existence, in order cannot thus think in the short run. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone obtains his attention rather on the fulfilment of the requirements of the own 3 G licence. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav epický means to it: "For negotiations with potential potential suppliers we open, in particular in area dividing from expenses and of infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> We consider out of the visibility of the customers just now this as the good. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The main strategy from Vodafone in this area finds in the research after a partner to assembly of a dividing net for a fast movable internet. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The responsible authorities -- with the suppliers hand in hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The process of the telephony suppliers is easy to understand, a large supplier called competition many, this and also became go down prices thereby to a decline of the profits lead. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Then one a such competitor the market entry erleichtern? </seg>
<seg id="62"> That can cannot the suppliers at a cord, if there go around something, also long justify hin und her that around the genesis from U: fon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> The strong well impression in direction TÚ went from, as U: fon on the market went back, T movable from the society out of. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The public accessible information from the TÚ-Webseiten also justify that. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Now though just U appropriate: why fon than argument, one shall not admit a potential supplier. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Martina Kemrová noticed it: "The competition environment of the telephony market recently moreover still a fourth supplier through the entry fortified. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Under obvious obvious, that a new actor put his provision of services high requirements on on at the market even and above all. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Against this herangehensweise of the suppliers absolute lack of interest of the Czech authorities however surprizes that. </seg>
<seg id="69"> He is on top of that not only a matter around the position of the TÚ, who the competence unfortunately not has-- developed in difference to Great Britain and large anticyclone states-- in Czech, in the economic competition to intervene. </seg>
<seg id="70"> This one owns exclusively the office to protection of the economic competition( ÚOHS). </seg>
<seg id="71"> This however reported his all typical position to this total problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> "The market entry of a potential telephony supplier were then possible, after and he a potential supplier the necessary infrastructure to an contract end between a telephony supplier over the Anmietung come. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Up to now no such contract was closed, thus the offer of potential amateurs not probably for the classic suppliers sufficient interesting", thus in his answer to our demand Kristián Chalupa from the department foreign relations of the ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> From representatives of the suppliers someone not surprise such formulation. </seg>
<seg id="75"> From an authority, who the consumer interests replace and inter alia it to respect, that nobody his position on the market abuses, this is many when dubious. </seg>
<seg id="76"> In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In stranger, potential suppliers all normal to get accustomed, to observe that her market entry have contributed to a price reduction by movable provisions of services." </seg>
<seg id="77"> Probably though belong the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction not to the interests of the ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> Really shocking is at this fall who almost already touching accord the three telephony suppliers, who results from her reaction. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question, whether he is a matter really only around a coincidence, finds on the hand. </seg>
<seg id="80"> How likewise the same absolutely gas price is certainly only and coincidence the consequence of an hard competition struggle by the service stations. </seg>
<seg id="81"> "The authority have discovered no signs in this matter, who to indicate a gerichtetes against the competition bargaining, and therefore also they no reason, on someone take in the matter intervene. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No the suppliers a domineering market position, therefore he does no longer have the corresponding increasing responsibility for his bargaining on the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The regulation authority for telecommunications probably also lacks the necessary instruments for an opening of the telephony market for potential suppliers ", Chalupa led in his explanation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The interpretation of the dominate position on the market is a from many controversial points. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Naturally there are an analysis of the major markets, worked out from the TÚ, after the telecommunications out of the visibility of the economic competition a single market is. </seg>
<seg id="86"> On a such market then naturally nobody the Czech telephony suppliers a dominate position inne. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Plain Rechtsexperten however offers an other visibility way-- for the market entry of a potential supplier always the agreement of the net operator is necessarily. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And the telephony suppliers the monopoly for his net-- wise--. </seg>
<seg id="89"> Who, that he necessarily takes a dominate position in an affirmative segment mean. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Himself that if one however not gives up with this argumentation, there shall be at least a warning for the ÚOHS, three telephony suppliers auffallend advance similar. </seg>
<seg id="91"> On top of that grievances of a line from amateurs( enclosed of the mentioning society of GTS Novera) justify, that they trip by negotiations with all suppliers on very similar obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="92"> The Abwälzung of the responsibility on the TÚ is then a really customary trick, with who the ÚOHS dissociates matter from the whole in the provisions of services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> This was already in some similar falls to watch. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately there have not succeeded, in who recently did vote amendment the telecommunications laws the expansion the competences the TÚ the economic competition on the area in who do to impose telecommunications, although a line had promised an improvement the situation from specialists it. </seg>
<seg id="95"> That mustn't only too well the representatives of the ÚOHS, thus probably they other interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> There already go, if nobody looks </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> Unnoticed the functioning of none of pseudovirtueller suppliers, from who there are at once several in the Czech telephony nets only once stays. </seg>
<seg id="98"> He however only partially enterprises, who own price tricks handle movable provisions of services, who public. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Normally he is namely a matter around enterprises, who to agieren in area Multilevel-Marketing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Own movable provisions of services for example offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, to Starlife and others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The price tricks of these enterprises normally reach only for Auserwählten. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The joke of the matter consists in inside, that a tall amount orders the enterprise compared with the operator when classic enterprise customer emerges, who at SIM-Karten. </seg>
<seg id="103"> As important customer he then gets special price offers( and other offers). </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem consists in inside, that the business conditions of all Czech telephony suppliers ban a took similar sale. </seg>
<seg id="105"> "There shall be falls, who to describe you, then he knows himself around an injury, with who who do contractual conditions bargain we we then development, what took a completion of the cooperation with the corresponding to society occupies", Martina Kemrová replied on our question to this problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> However really unlikely unlikely, that the telephony supplier thus a little not leaks by the officials. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In particular in fall of the three mentioning enterprises he can be a matter around thousand customers. </seg>
<seg id="108"> No operator opposes to however a such process. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Out of who namely simultaneous to get not activity these enterprises fliessen they not too neglecting profits they-- in difference to the real potential suppliers-- through the real official marketing compromize. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> On possible problems make epický Miroslav attentive: "The law allows such ways from speculations, in spite of all only the provisions of services these enterprises the customers from a very minimal percentage take hold. </seg>
<seg id="111"> This one must moreover accept, that the SIM-Karte not runs in her telephone on her name, she then not the telephony suppliers complete above have at disposal like the normal customers. " </seg>
<seg id="112"> Arrange alone that but the TÚ mustn't at least meet strange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> Moreover a large question for the ÚOHS opens himself. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Do the telephony suppliers before a such process close the eyes, why ban they himself against a potential supplier? </seg>
<seg id="115"> There is to add, that the ÚOHS Aufdeckung such activities really strong competences to, and if he not likes, not must he himself with the explanation the supplier, they knew nothing it and her business condition this bans, zufriedengeben. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> When the Czech Republic are no longer at expensive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> As already time and again stresses in text, the market entry of potential suppliers taught a clear price decline the unlike provisions of services. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Where on top of that have practically tried in all countries, been potential suppliers, the classic suppliers, who genesis practically to prevent more or inferior. </seg>
<seg id="119"> The using from they arguments were practically identical -- a too small, respectively. too very saturating market, problem by the quality of the provisions of services etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> In the anticyclone developed countries though the regulation organs just now intervened in these times, who by no means the interests the telephony suppliers, the separates their customer to wahren tried. </seg>
<seg id="121"> There is or niece formal through formal measures impression, they achieved that the first potential operator was born, and this one followed large. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately the Czech regulation organs speed himself the whole fall too like a warm potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Ready from our experience not we we the impression entledigen, that more than favourable confusion in the competences in these falls. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> Despite everything we do not throw the gun away in grain. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If a potential supplier and soon emerges the background information stimmen, the Czech market will perhaps soon again set himself in motion in. </seg>
<seg id="126"> , If a supplier admits the genesis of a potential telephony supplier will not be passively that ÚOHS, if there go darum, to refuse( discriminate). large amateur </seg>
<seg id="127"> And the Czechs then finally no longer telefonieren expensive as the rest of Europe. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="15"> Is men by much high developed when by the remaining primates and to fail seem by other creature complete. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At least by those aspects of our conscience, what Cortex depends präfrontalen on, darunter what learnings, who we are, and the aptitude to plan ahead and to decisions, then pass reason for the assumption, that the man even differs primates from the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> A large dramatic feature cannot find in the linguistic nature of the man: Since a thus tall part of his erlebens is associated with language, it often orders, the conscience slopes it as of. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this fall one cannot exclude animals. </seg>
<seg id="19"> , Yes even if conscience not depended on language were be this one he certain, so that bestial conscience, how he also provides likes himself, probably very from the many of our conscience condition distinguished. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="22"> The many of my version bear on the content of the aware erlebens, despite everything there next door still have a large aspect of the conscience, who his scientific easy accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> One cannot examine the conscience lawsuits from animals without consideration on her content, and exactly that happens by studies over the short time memory from primates, in particular at example of the Visualisierung. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Despite everything by this approach, the Christof cook and Francis Crick handled, one rather transfers the neuralen correlative of the conscience when on the causal mechanisms: Both no longer like identical his otherwise. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Curiously this approach also stresses the meaning of the präfrontalen Cortex for the Zustandekommen of the Visualisierung. </seg>

<seg id="27"> I bring them back it, that an emotional system the fear his own activity aware brain like that in someone activated. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What we than to qualify" fears", then the mental condition, in what we seal, if the activity the locating in brain defence system (or who consequences, physical reactions) work memories justify. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Thus seen sensations are tied closely up at the areas of the Cortex, the primates and in particular the man label. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Distinguished Abstufungen of the empfindens indulge in associations with the linguistic nature, because </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> On the other hand Antonio Damasio for example think, that sensations the Cortex and of the Hirnstammes hervorgehen out of primitive activities in the body feeling areas similar to Jaak Pankseep, who himself on the brain tribe concentrate. </seg>
<seg id="32"> , Since this network have much not changed himself in run of the human evolution can be participated absolutely in him at type comprehensive sensations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Purely theoretic I can not contradict that, it considers however for unbeweisbar. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Pankseep argue, what by rats and men like fear appear, feel probably also in two fall: How though can one verify whether rat and of man feel the same, if they behave similar? </seg>
<seg id="35"> Does a cockroach flee by danger whether she also feels fears? </seg>
<seg id="36"> In my eye just behaviour resemblance can still prove no Erlebensgleichheit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Indeed the neurale comparison beyond helps: Rat and of man in contrast similar brain tribes, cockroaches not even a brain. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Though is the brain tribe responsible for sensations? </seg>
<seg id="39"> And himself if one cannot prove that for the man: How'll one prove him by rats? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> I believe, that rat and other mammals of, perhaps even cockroaches (who does know?), sensations have. </seg>
<seg id="41"> However I did not know, how I shall prove that. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And because fundamentally himself her sensation alleged from the our distinguish( since the human conscience rests on on special schaltkreisen and on language), I study preferably the emotional behavior as the emotional sensations from rats. </seg>

<seg id="43"> At any rate progresses on the neuralen plain here wave, according as one sises the same by rat and of man. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hema-Quebec yesterday celebrated the 10. year day of their foundation, and their president, Dr Francine Décary, to delight all reason himself, then Hema-Quebec are to a the sure and efficient blood banks of the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And above all wiedergewonnen they the confidence the public turns upside down. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> How one knows, the managing of national blood reserves during the 1980er year with the HI-Virus and what does hepatitis C virus contaminate. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Against this drama and of the dissatisfaction of the public the government of Canada managed a public in Feb of 1994, through the judge Horace Krever inquiry drove a, who to goal, to bring light in the circumstances, the to a such tragedy led, to work out and directives, around a renewed disaster of this to prevent way. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While judge Krever was still nervous, to put back his report, several provinces then imagined a committee on the legs, what there were goal, a new system to administration from blood preserves in Canada to elaborate. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In Quebec the committee Gélineau fulfilled this mission. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the reports from Gélineau and Krever two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who around what is concerned about Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, and to handle others provinces the two territories. </seg>
<seg id="9"> 1998, when Hema-Quebec have taken her work hardly 38% the people confidences in the blood preserve system in Quebec, remind himself Dr Décary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was discouraging. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Through the huge efforts in order the security of the blood preserves improve improve and through the work on this area during the consecutive years, we have regained the confidence of the public', say her, before she stresses proud, that confidences in Hema-Quebec meanwhile had beginning of 2008 almost 94% the populations of Quebecs. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Dr Décary keeps however in conscience, that a little confidences extremely fragile '. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since their foundation at 28. Sep of 1998 bring the caution to Hema-Quebec after the principle. </seg>
<seg id="14"> To this time we attended the attitude of numerous falls of the human form of the beef insanity in Europe of, a new way of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Krankheit, tell this woman, who the direction holds since the foundation of 1998. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And we not the minimal idea whether this disease to translate over the blood. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Then we appointed a the main directive of the reports from Krever and Gélineau, who in conformity with one exclusion measures enforce, if one not knows this and if a disease advances only slowly, as visibly he the fall by the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Krankheit, who express through a Degeneration of the brain, what leads inevitably to death. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Then one accepted no blood from persons in Apr of 1999, who himself since 1980 long when a month had held in U.K. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Now, before some years proven doubts without everything that this disease is translated over the blood. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So this one have shown event, that the principle the caution, what we enforced, absolutely a sense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> 1999 a much exact technique to identification from HIV appeared on the market: Who directly Nukleinsäure-Tests( NST), to who to allow him, the donor the deposit the in blood to prove virus of himself, and not what who antibodies virus, he by against that who the fall was up to now using tests. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The NST allowed him, to shorten the Inkubationszeit, the between the moment, the person dispense and who, if am proven the first viruses through our technique in blood, take place, explain the specialist. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This time cannot be reduced to in the end by few. </seg>
<seg id="23"> So the risk, that were dispensed certain donors, without he to know, and one this not recognise, decreased important. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These improvements allowed AIDS over a blood bloodtransfusion to to him, the risk, translate, in considerable measure to drop. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Today a from 12 million persons danger danger, to get dispense blood with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="26"> With other words that means, that mustn't mustn't one 12 million blood preserves, before someone were contaminated with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> , Since Hema-Quebec shares each year between 400.000 and of 500.000 blood preserves he got many when 24 years last, before appearance, by who HIV translates over a blood preserve got a fall. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I believe that one can today feel well in addition to, if one gets a blood bloodtransfusion or prescribe, in order the health restore restore', mean the management leader from Hema-Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Our challenge for the close of ten years he get. </seg>
<seg id="30"> One does never know, what krankheitserreger can reach in system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Only how in past year the Chikungunya-Virus have emerged on the island Réunion, what, likewise the Westnil-Virus metaphorical. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We fort überwachen', doctor goes. Décary non-stop, before she stresses, that Hema-Quebec moreover puts a be sufficient supply on next to a sure supply to arrangement. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The need increases, because the population ages. </seg>
<seg id="34"> , Since the treatments to cancer struggle are aggressive the patients often need new red globules or Blutplättchen. </seg>
<seg id="35"> To what the ageing of the population also thwarts himself end, only 3% the in average on the blood donor net to blood gifts of suitable inhabitants of Quebecs belong. ' </seg>
<seg id="36"> In addition to each healthy man of, the 18 year or old is and the qualification criteria fulfill, all 56 tage, well six times in year, bloods give. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In average 14% the persons, who her blood to put on to arrangement, not adoptive, because for example they at AIDS or malaria erkrankt, and who been in a country, in the malaria spreads is, blood gifts for an year of excluded. </seg>
<seg id="38"> With these 3% we delete him, a to get inventory, what the needs of the hospitals correspond. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Deficient stocks are very rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But one must mustn't the members of this donor net, if get old she and no blood of more gifts. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Difficult difficult, to convince the people of it, to give, before all to hold however, her and it to bring, to get regular donors bloods they. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The life is today blood gifts thus feverish, that one finds the time rare, an hour by to pass', complain about Francine Décary. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With a year budget from 297 million dollars not only deliver Hema-Quebec to blood preserves, human fabrics also separate, underneath Knochentransplantate, heart works of, eyeball and of skin, who almost exclusive by heavy fire injuries used. </seg>
<seg id="44"> These fabrics examined, reshuffled and frozen, before am zwischengelagert they by Hema-Quebec, who the single public cord blood bank of Quebecs also manages. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In the umbilical cord, who early consider as biomedizinischer waste, rich blood, who to serve it seals knowhow at stem cells, serious illness, to treat for example leukaemia,. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Before some weeks we celebrated the cellarage of our thousandth blood test, and we plan ahead, to remove yearly more than thousand. </seg>
<seg id="47"> We shall begin well close beginnings year by it, to put him on for transplants to arrangement', Dr Décary declares large, who this programme the cord bloods-- blood test when describe very loved. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Many mothers are convinced by it, no access to it', thus Hema-Quebec lacks the means, this complex and expensive programme in all hospitals of Quebecs offer. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In their expense of 17. Sep Le Devoir published a letter from sir Patrick Garver, Vize-Generaldirektor of the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This one certifies, and someone on top of that pursues orwellsche logic, that small destitute house house and bids the tall gold extraction society of the world a libel complaint over six million against three authors for someone, with that aim, a public transparent debate'to open. </seg>
<seg id="4"> That if he ballots, the judges are independent and unprejudiced, then they do not over the truth, above all not in fall from libel complaints, only over the law appreciate. </seg>
<seg id="5"> How erwartet, was this fundamental difference hushed absolutely up by sir Garver. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Thus for Barrick gold to guide a public debate of, everybody to drift of, the the good way in the ruins he dares, a the her to replace contrary opinion. </seg>
<seg id="7"> All at once, like the lawsuit suppose, what and authors the editor the book Noir Canada development considerable sums ausgeben duty, around her defense prepare and with very irregular weapons against a armed forces from lawyers fight, the out of the almost inexhaustible bags the gold mine pays. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The tactic by these irregular struggles often in remaining, who the opposing party continues mundtot of and moreover each put off of, the he dares, himself again with the question to handle. </seg>
<seg id="9"> , If Barrick liked gold really a public debate they her visibility the things präsentieren duty before the public public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In contrast with it, what in many the countries, Barrick gold work, speed and gave, debates are normally adjusted in Canada through the swap from ideas and not through bludgeon blows. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He then had, if and had offengelegt the gold mine her book and of files a real debate open, independent through the journals, media, publications and the financing Prüfteams, who had sparse in this question bringen. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Though Barrick gold seem no confidence in the public public opinion and aloof wipe the petitions and of letters to support of the authors from Noir Canada with an Handbewegung. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Cannot perhaps sir Garver declare, simultaneously cannot he debate around a public'and in addition to yes who rightly opinions this public missachten? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apparently this word in the world of the vice president consists of only the generous paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; Someone all beautiful beengte visibility wise of the term. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy even slanderers the right to speak up. </seg>
<seg id="16"> What gold not understands Barrick-- or not understand-- is, that the public, who and the authors editor from Noir Canada supports, this above all therefore make, because the brutal position of the gold mine refuses them. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This public and to appreciate, however on the foundation of a civilise swap from arguments it prepare to listen to Barrick, and not in someone to frame, who a lot notice as gag complaint (in course of the public debate'a claim just now addressed Barrick gold at the authors from Noir Canada, in who they require from them, this term no longer use...). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Except from the surrealen speech from sir Garver, the complaint gold a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the wahrheitsfindung, who are fundamentally for each democratic society from Barrick. </seg>
<seg id="19"> She absolutely the right right, to quote and to discuss, who credibly sources over facts and of interpretations the basis the intellectual work bilden. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If impossible impossible Canada in a country there, topics, who not the rich enterprises this world favours, who knows otherwise the then make? </seg>
<seg id="21"> , If Barrick liked gold really a public and transparent debate cannot cannot she this one, while she succeeds the scientific standards, who use from the authors from Noir Canada. </seg>
<seg id="22"> She has a right to reply. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The academic environment, to who we belong to, for years knows, and to get and to solve conflicts debates disagreements in the grip. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The disproportionate complaint from Barrick gold show distinctly, that no desire for a transparent debate has them, in contrast with that, what she pleads,. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The elite is in danger </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The phenomenon already had himself before some days, when the junk room Milliarden-Dollar-Sparpaket the white house against the 700 balloted: A tall part of the Americans and more to punish Wall Street to save daran interest, who as the economy. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms the New York times, who, the republican party like the crisis in lope bring back to it to the yesterday expense blur, the himself always more split in her oldman and of fashion rate East Coast-Seele, the always the national institutions and the business community this one and favoured neokonservative, who" who in Washington" and the finance world hostile and fronts v.. in south and what centre of the states earns electors. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This part of the party owes v his ascent. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This just now mentioning example is while only a small part the tall changes, who the momentary economic earthquake announces or even already represent: Not only in the U.S, also west and perhaps also over this hinaus his affected from this one. </seg>
<seg id="6"> , What new under this one conditions to accelerate fear not only in the states when also shine in Europe the crisis events finally shape annehmen and at light devolves. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first of these phenomena the new discovery, the unprecedented rebirth of the state in connection with a way renationalisation of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In the act the crisis means a decline of the bank -- and finance institutions, what narrow connections to stranger a monstrous amount of the fortunes and owns at once from privathaushalten manage, the in a single state live. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This means a direct political problem for the governments: Namely worth compared with the affected families he himself, what yes also an huge elector measure represent. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Then seem economically global, political in contrast she is almost purely national. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Speech law thus in itself geraten in offside and seems the political Internationalismus to lost: The clear proof of been from the EU to find no common way because of of their zweiteilung in unlike national and international conflicts knows. </seg>
<seg id="12"> From then on all now expect the intervention of the own state;. Distribution from help back:, Since the crisis got always serious exclusively the U.S in the economical situation of himself without to save foreign help. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And next to the means they moreover also own the legitimation to use this one: Therefore two not to überwertende conditions under affirmative circumstances, on what differently well no international organisation and no market in similar way resort to know. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> That new insistence, who are put on on, is brought sector in remaining in perfect accord with the always tall meaning, who lately used in the economy with an on narrow in connection: The Territorialität. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There is now just paradoxical way, thus so as we, for years in a connected total empire convince it of merchandise take place, in an empire of the always differentiate technologies, the immaterial, that we on once note, as thus always more our future from the essentiell material things depend: Water, crop and oil. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This one indeed all the world certain from a place at the other transported, am but however on outside paraphrased closely with someone bit erde connected to a territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> From then on this is, who have a such territory at disposal, an other opposite, who otherwise crop unproductive, water fates free area in someone from oil deposits live, in advantage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I now come to second novelty, who however assumes a short insertion. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Who territory, who government, who policy says, also tell Leadership it. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In this sense to produce the financial crisis two converging phenomena seem. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the one hand that is there look around the need Leaderships, well what need after someone, who does, one settles the things know. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On the other side a wave of the indignation over the existed directions, v. now insists </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> On top of that a deep be sufficient and still worrying in certain sense aspect in the end comes: A confidence loss, an Unduldsamkeit, a picture of the Unzweckmäßigkeit, a feeling of the distance, who whole office the western countries on a whole class from manager execute. </seg>
<seg id="24"> There thus seem himself the conviction under tall parts who population the way to railways, that not only he the acts the social elite, only already her idea world, her Way of Life, her cultivation in large sense of the word, are, who content himself the majority when always foreign and überkommener represent. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The demand for Leadership then feeds underground a powerful movement of the entmachtung of the distinguished class and of the traditional political establishments however branched out. This demonstrates in unexpected" revolt" of the electors and in sudden change of mind of the collective condition of the last time:, Delegated the ascent of the conservative in Austria and Bavaria beginnend mit over the collapse of the Labour-Partei in Great Britain, to against Bush( and perhaps the victory also here communicates the right in Italy to a role). </seg>
<seg id="26"> One earns the impression, when good the old elite, their party, her programme but also her rite, publications, of intellectual believers,, manch einer got legends she format, always more understanding problems and from then on worthy of few representative concerning what, what today the west in the inferior social layers before himself go and from the financial crisis still and reinforce until hin to Überdimensionalität wheeled. </seg>
