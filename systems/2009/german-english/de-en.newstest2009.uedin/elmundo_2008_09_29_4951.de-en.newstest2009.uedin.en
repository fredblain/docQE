In Mexico, and without 'peep-toes' 
With British punctuality, at 5: 40 p.m., the hour was provided by the programme, in addition to the Präsidialhangars of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF, landed the plane of the Spanish air force, with the Prince of Asturias and Tin travelled. 
The sun went down, but their radiation still have forced to the hand and to use sun screen, the royal couple, what the exit from the plane to see. 
Directly in the gangway: The Spanish ambassador and other authorities 
A few hours before that, I had a taxi drivers on the road asked whether he knew that the Prince of Asturias and for Tin visited the city, the official travel to formalise. 
- Ah, very good, so there can be made at the airport at this time is no people take you from here or so 
No, it is the a Spaniard, but she has a couple years lived here. 
-Ach, very well 
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and the for Tin of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey. 
There are many, the Hangar the airport and wait on the red carpet, even military protection of 27 soldiers of the navy Ehrensalve issue. 
The prince smiling seems, in navy blue, and they, the for Tin, with long by the wind gewehten hair without normal 'peep-toes', perhaps she was informed that it a storm in DF expected. 
Before they enter the Chamber, they smile and are on the photographers, in which the official entourage is waiting. 
At the door of the hotel, where they are housed, one of the four biggest in the city, is waiting for a Reporterin by the Mexican television, like the joke.
