The Sudeten demanded a referendum by the United States 
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 had the affiliation of the Böhmerwaldes to the United States is asking. 
This is clear from a letter, the in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library stored. 
If we do not part of Germany and Austria can be, we at least under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With such a desire to be some groups of Sudeten Germans in 1945 to US President. 
It is, among other things, read from a letter, in a private archives have been and the today is in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library will be kept. 
The Germans Krumau ask the letter of the American President, he should ask for the return of the "Sudetengaus" - on the basis of the Munich Agreement of Hitler - was adopted in Czechoslovakia would not allow. 
"We have the situation correctly understood the words and we really want to be sure that the American units not oppressors and enemies into German territory, but as liberators," it is said in a letter, with the words "people to whom the fate of the Sudeten dear" is signed. 
Since the end of Czechoslovakia, the Sudeten Germans in knowledge of the Czech National character - might suggest that they brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery would expect, ask the author of the letter the American President, for today and for ever on the protection rule Böhmerwald. 
"We cannot believe that you without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area for us grant a foreign state, the minorities oppressed and tried to remove and nothing has contributed to the victory of the allies," is in the letter to read. 
The reason why the author did not sign, is supposedly the fear Rachegelüsten "Czech oppressors." 
If the US President doubts about the affiliation of Böhmerwalddeutschen have, whether it be sufficient, if he in the Böhmerwaldgau would initiate a referendum on whether the inhabitants of part of the United States or rule under the protection of the United States wanted to live. 
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of the post-war history may sound a little naive, but he has some witness to a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans. 
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to at least guessed that it on their removal from the Republic would negotiate, just a few of them such an opportunity. 
Some waited that the United States and Britain for the Sudeten a kind of autonomy would negotiate. 
Still others believed that they could simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The confirmed the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, from Budweis comes. 
He has been in the war as Budweiser German in the navy in the Baltic Sea. 
As he at the end of the war in British captivity and it came in a prisoner of war camp after Holstein said, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him, he should teach them Czech. 
"They believed that when they come home, they would be the Czech to Pass," Chalupa. 
No one of the German prisoners of war, before the war in Czechoslovakia had lived, projected in his view, with him on the basis of the Beneš Decrees from the Republic would drive.
