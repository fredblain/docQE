Obscure in city streets, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell 
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues are opening, side streets and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and other only comfortably. 
However, is it even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing local difficult to say where Extra Place, simply because most of them have never heard. 
These tiny street is in the East Village, and of the First Street north between the Bowery and Second Avenue, without the Second Street to achieve. 
It is 30 inch and 120 feet long and rather after a dusty alleyway and used for an active through road from. 
There are also no road signs. 
It is virtually impossible to them on a Standard-Straßenplan to strike. 
The road has nevertheless, their admirer. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company, which recently on the First Street luxuriöse buildings built. 
It wants an extra Place newly pflastern, a clean by voyage to the shops and Boutiquen, the in the new buildings are expected to be created. 
On the other Verehrern heard the long-standing neighbourhood, which says that she was fascinated by the short alleyway, simply because they are one of the remains of the past of the housing blocks. 
But the city government department and establishment of the accommodation for protection is competent and responsible for the road, has no interest in it. 
During a meeting of the Committee for land use of the municipal council in this month representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company worked out. 
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan, which will be presented next month, Susan Stetzer, the district of responsible on the local council, 3. 
"Only very little space in the possession of the city remained, and we want Extra Place still is part of the city," she said. 
"It could be offers, as the road repaired and which could be done by Avalon, but we also want the public access is guaranteed." 
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago, the small street pflastern and set up new seats, which among other things are for a café thought that the company would like to rent space. 
The idea that the street Avalon Bay could buy, for the first time during the meeting made public in this month. 
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road while, it wants to it but not necessarily have. 
"The main concern of the Avalon Bay is the pathway to renovate the dilapidated and at a public meeting point to make," she said, adding that the city of even the sale had proposed. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department for building protection said that it would indeed have been the desire of the city, the street to sell and stressed that the task of the unit is to develop the property rather than to administer. 
Compared with its colourful neighbourhood The Bowery, has an extra Place something of his historic impression maintained. 
Some believe that the street 1802 get their names in the years, as a great Farm, the Philip Minthorne, was divided between his numerous children and a close strip of land by any claims. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the Punkrockdenkmals, which in 2006 was opened up to the Extra Place and the road is certainly the most well known as a backdrop for the photo opportunity on the Cover of Albums "Rocket to Russia" of Ramones. 
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the managers of the Ramones, of the photograph was made in November 1976. 
The street was full of scrap metal, shackles and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and Seilen. 
Some residents, the bloggers einschliesslich, the East Village on the Gentrifizierung write, have the idea of the sale of Extra Place rejected, with the argument that this public land, as modest as it is, should continue to remain publicly. 
Others have Extra Place as a rarity – virtually unchanged hailed a cluster of the city that should be left in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, of the blog called "Jeremiahs verschwindendes New York" (untertitelt engages with "The Book of the complaints, a bitter nostalgischer view of the dying city"), has a part of the discussion of the city of history on Extra Place published, the magazine 'The New York "was published in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, was: "Extra Place is a small close impasse, even during the day and by dark verrostete metal door remains the warehouses, closed window and Regenrinnen over flying weeks old newspapers marked". 
With a few exceptions, the road has as recently appeared in one evening. 
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door, the sooner the CBGB led, where today is a more expensive clothing business. 
Graffiti on the walls were to see an empty beer bottle and was on the ground, not far from a fresh set of stuck newspapers. 
A few passers-by said that they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be improved somewhat. 
Fields, added that in his view, some people the lure of the road in its current state underestimated. 
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that the dark, damp and disgusting manner.
