Finally Illhäusern... 
After a long drought Illhäusern is finally back on the pitch on course for success. 
Without much effort erspielten the Gelb-Schwarzen many Torchancen and shipped it to implement one of them, and so the game to win. 
The speed of that meeting, in which the attacker trouble had to show their skills, was not very high. 
After a first attack of the host captain Kauffmann, whose long-distance shot just at the corner is lost, with ease Illhäusern should dominate the game, and it was only one Fonderflick with a long-distance shot, then brain with a high pass Romain and with a shot in the foot tip, the defence of Denmark challenge. 
The rival team blockte in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm. 
The start of the second half should be crucial with the first two by Riahi and temporale Torchancen won, and immediately afterwards, with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, the just right, was to adopt a ball back, in a first attempt by Diebold had been repelled. 
But the illhäusische Torschütze should be lucky not long can enjoy and about 12 minutes later to the bank will be sent, making his team comrades numerically vastly inferior to continue to play. 
Denmark, however, knew it was not exploit a illhaeusischen Elf and no major problems, the only withdrew a little, in order to increase their defence ', except in the last seconds of the game in which the ball after a mess very close to the bar is lost.
