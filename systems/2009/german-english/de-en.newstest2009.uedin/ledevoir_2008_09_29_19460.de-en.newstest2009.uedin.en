The letter - A entehrtes country 
Mr Vic Toews, still exported -Minister Justice '(the irony) in the cabinet Harper was to the last summer, prevented about Louise Arbour to say that it was a "disgrace" for Canada. 
This woman who an interminable fight for justice has led and all our admiration deserves, with outrage to cover, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister from, as on Stephen Parker itself. 
We are dealing with a government to do, as only for all the countries affected their in the concentration camps Guantanamo captive compatriot home has not taken. 
A government that does not even considered that Omar Khadr was still a young person, and crossed the things that are being accused of. 
The only government, which, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaking its word and a child soldier in inhuman conditions. 
The only, a Justice parody downwards, to assess the guilt of the accused. 
We remind ourselves that especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers argue, Omar Khadr to bring home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada. 
It is this government also closes its eyes to the torture: They are more interested in little that a young adult after so many years of painful for mentally certainly always will be broken. 
We are not yet aware, but what we are witnessing is an insidious curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, which Harper constantly as a banner in front of it, and it sounds so noncommittal out of his mouth. 
It is, therefore, the time has come, in which there is no morality is more: It is a Canadian citizen abuse arbitrarily, tortured and imprisoned, quite as they see fit of a Government, until today is supported only by the minority (may he after the 14 October quite belong to a minority...). 
Many voters think that their salvation at a party, the virtue, law and order preaches. But they do not see that this government has broken away from the what the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this Lossagung, and nowhere else.
