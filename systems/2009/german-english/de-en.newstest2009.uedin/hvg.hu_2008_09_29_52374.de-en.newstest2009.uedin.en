The psychology of the Überbietens - or why we are prepared to pay more 
At an auction buyers tend to spend more and the Feilgebotene therefore to exaggerate the effect. 
Neurologists to economic researchers and the University of New York is managed to neurologisch-ökonomischen foundations of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior to discover. 
According to a "Science" magazine publicised study want to the people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, beaten and are therefore not be prepared to pay even excessive prices. 
The researchers have tried to the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions to explore. 
A group of volunteers Lotto should play, while the other in a play with these action participated in both cases - were the active brain regions of the subjects through functional magnetischer resonance (fMRI) investigated. 
In two games, the participants were able to win money, but has been increased activity of the Striatum, of a set below the Gehirnrinde, losers of the auction measured in the opponent's sort of an essential role. 
In addition to many other functions is this brain region for the "even reward" of the nervous system. 
The researchers said that the price increase could be by avoiding an overreaction of the Striatums explain. 
Their thesis to back up, have the economists in the group of researchers in addition studies to follow up the money. 
In this case, should three groups against a partner under different conditions to bid. 
The control group was told the real value of the product, then they have made their operations. 
Another group of 15 dollar reward promised, if they emerge as winners from the game. 
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which in the case of a lost game were also lost. 
The difference between the two groups was then simply that the emphasis on the one on the profits, while the other was on the losers. 
As evidence of the idea expressed by neurologists were the members of the "against the losers' group of games to higher operations ready, as those in the control or the" profit "group. 
"These results fall of any previous economic theory. 
These have the patterns of behaviour observed in auctions, so far, only to the joy on the profits, or the risk prevention. 
The contradiction between these two theories was thanks to the imaging neurological procedure dissolved, so that we now have a third statement of Europe, "said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics faculty of the University of New York.
