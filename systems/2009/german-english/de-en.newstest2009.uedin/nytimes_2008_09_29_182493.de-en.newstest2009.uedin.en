Debate on bilingual education: Education in English language environment 
In this edition of "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller, debate and lance T. Izumi the positions of the candidates for the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, senior scientific staff in Kalifonischen studies and senior director in the specialist education sciences in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "is not as good as we think: Why is the middle class a Schulauswahl needs". 
To the Hispanic voters is a complex task. 
Barrack Obama's proposals on the subject of education are a case in point. 
Obama's campaign said, the "the likelihood afro-amerikanischen and Hispanic students in the school concluded successfully, is lower than in white pupils' - which is true. 
This achievement gap to close Obama's education plan recommends specifically from other a bilingual transition in the training for those who only learn English. 
Nevertheless, there is the question for Obama is whether his commitment to the bilingual education, the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, his interest, the gap in the Schulleistungen. 
Take this as an example of "" preparatory conference "Sixth Street", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. 
The majority of pupils are hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently in the country are, learn English. 
Nevertheless, have amazing 100% in 2008 pupils of the fourth class the state math exam in on a good footing. 
Also surprising was 93 per cent of children from the fourth school in the English test evaluated as well. 
The astonishing success was achieved with other methods, as those who preferred by Obama. 
The school Sixth Street will make its focus to review and exercise at constant monitoring of knowledge and an attitude that no exceptions tolerated. 
In addition, the school is the approach that the training in an English-speaking environment. This is precisely the point that Obama should bear in mind, the Schulleiterin Linda Mikels. 
This approach attaches importance to the almost ausschliesslichen use of the English language in the specialist teaching. 
Madam Mikels, the idea of bilingual education rejects it, said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a student, who only came about from Mexico. 12 months later, the class room entering and it can no longer recognize. 
"It will work," she said, "it works for us". 
Would Obama a school as the "Sixth Street" preparatory conference "" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learning pupils? 
The performance of the school would be the answer to this question easily, but the educational positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support of the bilingual education make predictions on Obama's answer uncertain. 
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently the subject of trivialised by he said that people should stop concerned about the "only English" separatist legislation. 
Instead, he said: "They should ensure that your child is Spanish." 
If Obama really wants to close the achievement gap, should he carefully consider education models, the work, rather than to despise and to trivialize.
