If the energy from the waves springs suddenly run the Great on 
It is a source of money versiegende, what about 70% of the surface of the planet and it is only now that the big energy companies seem to understand the world. 
Waves, tides and currents are the new renewable energy sources at all times, and also seek to occupy, such giants like Chevron. 
The possibility of energy from the movements of the sea to win, is already in account for 70 years and studied; it is no coincidence that intensified these studies since the first oil crisis, considerably. 
As the price of oil by 1980 vergas caved to the idea of marine energy, but now urge the environmental organisations and the increase in the price of oil to new impetus in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world long energy needs from the energy produced by the ocean waves could be met. 
This would be the as much honey as the current energy produced by nuclear power stations. 
Moreover, would be added the currents and tides. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first firm, which is now on the marine energy, is Enersis that in 2005, a treaty for the construction of a power station in the north of Portugal has signed. 
As the news was published it seemed a revolutionary step to act. 
Two years later, there are now more and more companies in the traditional energy sector, which for the marine energy production. 
"Chevron analyses these technologies", the spokesman of the American giant well-known company in the Wall Street Journal – and compensate the possibility is to cooperate with us. " 
This is the creation of an authorisation from the US Energy Commission, which deserves a project off the coast of Alaska to start. 
This is not to be underestimated as a sign that things primarily when you consider that it is still in Alaska oil would be supported by the United States and President Bush recently even the plans for new Bohrungen set in motion. 
In addition to Chevron are also the firms Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey to invest in the new industry; the details are not known, but so are talking observers from a rising interest. 
Even improvement dignified technologies. 
Experts speak of a still at the start, when technology, not least because there is not the last doubt from the environmentalists are resolved. 
So far, there are projects such as the one in Portugal and Scotland seem rather minor dimension and no serious environmental problems to cause. 
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, is technologies with far greater impact on the environment. 
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, is using a system of interlinked Bojen. 
The burst of the waves, which has moved on and rain Bojen, within the swimmer Kolben hat on and in hydraulic pressure converted. 
This is forcing a Turbine, which in turn is a generator. 
The electricity is out on underwater pipelines sent to the coast. 
Until now, there are four planned investment of this kind, which only to wait for the government approval. A part of its energy could also be used for military facilities. 
Verdant power produced energy, however, were already for a department store and through a Parklatz unterseeischer turbines in the East River in New York. 
The water movements during the tidal forces the turbines, which by the burgeoning Drehbewegung the surreal generator. 
According to the Verdant has been waiting a long queue of potential clients on the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources. 
Only the waves, then the tides. 
A special interest deserves, according to the Institute for power generation research for the moment, the potential, which is in the tides. 
Although it also an irregular phenomenon, but the tides are more unpredictable than wind currents, the sun and the waves, and therefore look like a more reliable source of electricity. 
It is precisely the tidal energy is what federal states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states have already $7.5 million in 2008 – to invest for 2009 are already up to 35 million planned.
