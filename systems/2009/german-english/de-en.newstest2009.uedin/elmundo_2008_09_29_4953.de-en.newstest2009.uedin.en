Talk in the sleep 
Some children speak at night, 
I am not referring to those who wake up and tell us something, what happened the day before, but children during the course of the sleep, talk. 
If you do it for the first time, in the best case scenario would be shocked to see it, but in the real world has no importance. 
This is a positive sleep disorder, the speaking in their sleep. 
It is quite widespread, especially among children and young people. 
Certainly, it was more than one of you told that her at night you have spoken. 
This phenomenon can occasionally occur (a time in life, such as during the high fever), or on a regular basis (every day, once per week, once a month), the next day the child can point to nothing. 
There is no reason to this phenomenon. 
Often links with other phenomena in the sleep explored, such as nightmares, panic at night, Enuresis noctura (Bettn√§ssen at night), speaking in the sleep sought, but there is no reason to do so. 
As we have mentioned earlier, can it a very high Fiber, stress situations or asking too much. 
In any case, it is a little erforschtes phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it occurs, is very variable. 
It may be that if we talk in individual words, whispering in or it can be quite a opposite (cries, wines, long discussions). 
In the cases if the statement is very hard, it is recommended that the child to watch and a specialists to be advised to check whether a problem which is causing fear and in this way. 
We have said that it is a positive disruption, is not dealt with it, whether it is linked with a different sleep disorder, which can be treated (for example, with the Schlaf-Apnoe or with the stress). 
What we can do is a series of simple preventative measures to carry out. 
Try the child before the sleeping not to get. 
In other words, calm game for the child to choose and avoid stressige television programmes, the terrible and a little too wild. 
In the nervous children, which Entspannungen to recommend that relaxation methods can be used to help them, a certain Home rest. 
This helps the child to sleep quietly. 
If the freedom of speech in their sleep is once again trying to preserve the rest. 
To think that it for the child is harmless, and the next day it will not be able to recall what happens. 
Some useful advice 
Weck it not. 
This is useless, because the baby is not, so be it from the sleep. 
Although the child speaks, asleep in it, so it is built. 
Think back, if it after a pair of phenomena scared shows, it is recommended to receive advice, or to find out what reason the child for the fear. 
If they understand what it says so usually (not), is the child is under pressure in order to carry out an interrogator opening street market-style negotiations and more information. 
You are so that it can achieve nothing, because when the baby is sleeping, it is unconscious and not to think about it. 
In addition, she will listen to what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it that says, that is why you are careful with the interpretation of the information and the lessons from it. 
Perhaps, says the child that her the night to hear and its secrets know. 
Not even as a joke. 
This caused a great deal of fear. 
So, makes you no worries, there is nothing wrong, this is a moment that only a few minutes.
