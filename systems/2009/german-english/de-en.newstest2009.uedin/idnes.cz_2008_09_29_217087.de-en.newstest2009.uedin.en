The first virtual providers are already in this year after the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps it 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite fully developed, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they also by its partners in Western Europe are offered. 
Nevertheless, is missing something here - a virtual providers, the conventional forces to lower prices. 
Perhaps this is not be long in coming. 
The Czech mobile telephone providers to the most expensive in Europe in the first place to work, as we have often on Mobil.cz reported. 
It also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, the attention made that the price of a text message here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. 
After the last steps of the European Commission in terms of regulation of roaming charges is as likely to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone operators will be cheaper SMS from abroad than at home. 
So how is it that the prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe so high? 
The answer is simple, there is no competition, which really a challenge. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic, but there are three mobile networks and a Penetration of far more than 100%. 
The mobile phone operators to go against the fact that it in the Czech market is very much competition. 
The does often also the chairman of the Council of the Czech telecommunications authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, which in the past has often said that no place in the Czech Republic for another supplier. 
It is likely that a classic providers with their own network no longer has very many opportunities (incidentally, he probably would hardly any frequencies. 
But there is still a possibility - a virtual providers. 
It is precisely the entry of virtual providers in the mobile market expressed a clear price reduction, on the traditional mobile phone operators had to respond. 
But was it before the entry of such firms such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain similar votes as in the Czech Republic. 
But it has shown that there is room for such providers and that this really can succeed. 
Incidentally, you need not long after examples to seek. 
In February of this we have on the launch of the virtual provider mobile King reported in Poland. 
In just half a year, this providers, more than 100 thousand customers to win and so on the five biggest supplier of the country standing. 
Behind mobile King is the financial group Penta, in the Czech Republic, among other things, U: Fon has. 
The advantage of virtual providers is that it on a much more specific target group can focus. 
In order to be able to be efficient, virtual providers need much less customers as a classic providers. 
They need not a relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In the world as the virtual providers themselves as normally Low-Cost-Firmen - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, however, often by a less extensive service. 
So, for example, offers Tesco in the UK Mobile SMS by at least half cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as the example of mobile King in Poland shows that it can also be a very good move on a not klischeehafte target group. 
This providers is specifically aimed at men. 
"Real Kerle choose mobile King - the provider, they like it and they can trust," David Seibert, the chief executive of the Mobile entertainment Company, the company of this virtual provider. 
It's hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland and in the Czech Republic could take root. 
Doubt the press secretary of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is for a segment of the market, in the most virtual providers are based, relatively small. 
He is also from the point of view of the services offer relatively saturated. " 
In the Czech Republic chancenlos, my mobile phone providers 
But it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile phone operators segment of the Czech Republic, this does not mobile King will be. 
"We talk about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations are not particularly hope. 
It is rather to a market of mobile King in other countries are our region, "says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press spokesman for the financial group Penta. 
Indirectly, confirmed it so that the current mobile phone providers in the Czech Republic that ideas are not particularly favor. 
On the contrary, they are trying to ensure that not a potential competitor. 
Their interest in a launch of a virtual mobile provider for some time already shows the group GTS Novera who wish to take a further step, a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of wholesale to be. 
"We have a great interest in our customers do not only fixed, but also Mobilfunk-Telekommunikationsdienstleistungen offer. 
And the sooner, the better. 
This is the opportunity we have repeatedly with all the Czech mobile providers negotiated. 
With some of them already, we were able to achieve progress in negotiations, "the press spokesman for the group Kaidl Pavel. 
Perhaps now come better times. 
Is not official information reveals that the first virtual providers perhaps to be expected by the end of the year. 
So far, but this is of an insurmountable wall of silence surrounded. 
"At the moment we are not assuming that in the Czech Republic for a full virtual providers. 
The Czech market compared to other markets has great specifics on. 
So far, we still has no subject with a complex and serious project in this area mentioned ", says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2. 
On the specific nature of the Czech market point further providers. 
The press by German operator T-Mobile presenting its spokeswoman Martina Kemrová bows in rare agreement with the statement by O2 added: "So far, we have not yet a viable and mutually albeit found on which one could build on." 
And it added: "In the network of German operator T-Mobile presenting its by the end of the year is hardly a virtual providers. 
In this moment we should already have a concrete offer, in order to be able to think in the short term. " 
Vodafone direct its attention more to meet the requirements of the own 3G-Lizenz. 
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers are we open, particularly in the field of division of costs and infrastructure. 
We look at it from the point of view of the customers as the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in search of a partner to build a shared network for a quick mobile Internet. " 
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand 
The actions of the mobile telephone providers is easy to understand another providers would be more competition, that would lead to a fall in prices and also lead to a decline in profits. 
Why, then, should be such a competitors from entering the market facilitate? 
That the providers can pull together, if something is also fined the long commuting the emergence of U: Fon. 
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction ČTÚ was at time when U: Fon came on the market, of the German operator T-Mobile presenting its society. 
The show also the publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ-Webseiten. 
But now is precisely U: Fon as a reason why we should not allow a virtual providers. 
Martina Kemrová said: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently been entering the market and a fourth mobile provider strengthened. 
In light of the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is clear that a new player in the market itself and, above all, his services high standards. " 
In view of this approach of the mobile phone operators, however, surprised the absolute indifference of the Czech regulatory authorities. 
It is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ in Czech, unlike Britain and other developed countries - not the competence has, to intervene in the economic competition. 
This is exclusively the office for the protection of economic competition (ÚOHS). 
This but was this whole problem to his very typical attitude. 
"The market of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after it to a contract between a mobile phone providers and a virtual providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
So far, no such contract was concluded, because the supply of potential stakeholders for the traditional operators was probably not enough interesting, "in his response to our question Kristián Chalupa by the department of external relations ÚOHS. 
By representatives of the providers would not be surprising. 
By one authority, the consumer interests represented and, among other things, to ensure that no one misused his position in the market, this is more a matter of concern. 
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual providers work quite normal, is entering the market at a price reduction in mobile telephone services has helped." 
But are probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and not a price cut to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
It is truly shocking in this case, the almost touching line of the three mobile phone providers, from their reactions. 
The question of whether it really is just a coincidence, is obvious. 
Just as the absolutely same petrol price of petrol stations certainly only coincidence, the consequence of the tough competition. 
"The authority has no evidence discovered in this matter, at a point against the competition act along, and therefore has no reason in some way to intervene in the matter. 
None of the supplier has a dominant market position, so he has not the appropriate increased responsibility for his actions in the market. 
The necessary instruments for the opening of the mobile phone market for virtual providers also probably lack the regulatory authority for telecommunications, led Chalupa in his statement. 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points. 
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drafted by the ČTÚ, after the telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market. 
In such a market has, of course, none of the Czech mobile telephone providers a dominant position. 
But some legal experts have a different point of view, for access to the market of a virtual provider is always the approval of the network operator. 
And the mobile phone providers - logically has - for its network the monopoly. 
The means that he, in a certain segment necessarily a dominant position. 
Even if we were not able but with this argument, it for the ÚOHS should at least be a warning that three mobile phone operators are remarkably similar. 
This show complaints of a number of interested parties (including the above society GTS Novera) that it in negotiations with all providers in very similar difficulties. 
Buck-passing ČTÚ is on the in the telecommunications services quite a common ploy, with the ÚOHS of the whole matter. 
This was so in a number of similar cases. 
Unfortunately it is possible in the recent revision of the telecommunications law passed the enlargement of the powers of the ČTÚ on the field of economic competition in the telecommunications, although a number of experts from promised an improvement of the situation. 
This is the representatives of the ÚOHS know only too well, but they probably have other interests. 
It is, if no one watching 
First unappreciated remains the functioning of any pseudovirtueller providers, which in the Czech mobile networks several. 
There are firms that own price lists for mobile telecommunications services are spending, but only partly open to the public. 
It is normally by firms in the area Multilevel-Marketing act. 
Their own mobile telephone services offer Amway, for example, Bohemia Telecom, Star life and others. 
The price lists of these firms usually only selected to come. 
The joke of the matter is that the firm to the operators as a classical firms customer occurs, of a large amount of SIM cards. 
As an important client receives he then specific price offers (and other offers). 
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone providers a similar resale ban. 
"Should there be cases that you describe, then it is a violation of the contractual conditions, which we are working, which brought an end to cooperation with the relevant society can bring," said Martina Kemrová to our question on this problem. 
However, it is unlikely that something in the leaders of the mobile phone operators gets around not. 
Particularly in the case of the three listed firms can it be thousands of customers. 
No operator, however, opposes such a move. 
From the activity of these companies that they are not negligible gains, at the same time, be it - unlike the real virtual suppliers - not by the real official marketing. 
To possible problems Miroslav Čepický: "The law allows these types of speculation, despite all the services of these firms, only a very small percentage of customers used. 
This must also accept that the SIM-Karte in their telephone not on their behalf, so they may not have fully about how the normal customer of the mobile phone providers. " 
That alone but should the ČTÚ at least strange deposits. 
It also opens up a further question for the ÚOHS. 
Close the mobile telephone providers from such an approach, why they are against a virtual providers? 
It is to add that the ÚOHS to uncover such activities have very strong powers, and if it does not want to, it must not with the declaration of the providers, they knew nothing and their business conditions would this ban, satisfied. 
When the Czech Republic is not the most expensive 
As the text has already been pointed out on several occasions, the market brought a sharp price drop virtual providers in the various services. 
Bearing in virtually all countries, where virtual providers are created, the traditional providers tried to the emergence of practically more or less to prevent. 
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - is too small, or too much gesättigter market, problems with the quality of the services, etc. 
In the advanced countries but just stepped in these times, the regulatory bodies, the far from the interests of the mobile telephone providers, but tried to maintain their customers. 
Is it by formal or informal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operators, and this was followed by further. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies raise to the whole case like a hot potato. 
On the basis of our experience, we can not get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competence in these cases is more than favourable. 
But we do not throw the Flinte. 
If the background information is correct and soon a virtual providers emerge, the Czech mobile market may soon to move again. 
If a supplier to the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, is allowing the ÚOHS will remain inactive when it comes to reject (to discriminate against other interested parties). 
And finally, the Czechs are no longer telephone more expensive than the rest of Europe.
