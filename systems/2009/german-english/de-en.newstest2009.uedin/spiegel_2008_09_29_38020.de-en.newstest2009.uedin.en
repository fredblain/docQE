Even rats have feelings 
A rat Schabe in danger or a flight, does that mean that you also feel fear? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced that a lot of animals have feelings. 
Just as you might check whether they feel the same, if they like we conduct? 
In the Internet magazine "Edge" for several years of contributions famous scientists published. 
Mirror online message in a series of selected answers to the question, "What do you think for true, without it prove to be?" 
I believe that animals feelings and other awareness conditions without that I, or anyone else, that is what could prove where we are not even can provide evidence that other human consciousness. 
But in this case, can we at least hope, because all human brains are the same Grundkonfiguration. 
As soon as we do, however, turn to other species and issues of the sense of consciousness or generally make entering we impassable terrain, because the hardware disagree. 
If a rat is in danger, is doing the same thing as many other animals: It is dead, retreats or attacks. 
People behave similarly, from which some scientists on a comparable subjective experience. 
Not, however, I think. 
Two aspects of the brain structure makes it difficult, our subjective experience on the of animals. 
On the one hand, close the almost always associated with human consciousness circuits the roadside prefrontal cortex a (because of its participation in the short memory and the Ausführungs- / management functions). 
This broad region is in human developed much higher than in the rest of the primates and seems to be lacking entirely on other befits creatures. 
At least for those aspects of our consciousness, the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and to decide, so there is reason to believe that the man even different from the other primates. 
Another dramatic nature is in the linguistic nature of the people: Because such a large part of his Erlebens associated with language, it often means the awareness of oversupply. 
In this case, could rule out animals. 
But even if awareness not by language had depended, it certainly influence, animal awareness, as it may be, like, probably very of the majority of our Bewusstseins-zustände differences. 
It is therefore difficult to measure how awareness in other animals may be. 
If it is, and as something meeting Subjektives, either measure, because of the specific hardware, using our own experience can analyse, his research into major problems. 
Most of my comments relate to the content of the deliberate Erlebens, but there is also another aspect of the awareness, the scientific might be more easily accessible. 
It could be the awareness processes of animals without regard to investigate their content, and that is what is happening in studies on the short memory of primates, particularly in the case of the Visualisierung. 
But this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed up, we moved more on the neural Korrelate awareness than on the causal mechanism: They may or may not be identical. 
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex, to reach the Visualisierung. 
What is for the feelings? 
I attribute it to the fact that an emotive system like the fear in one of his own activity conscious brain activated. 
What we as a "fear", is the mental state in which we are, if the activity of the brain lokalisierten defense system (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) working memory. 
As seen sentiments are closely tied to the regions of the cortex, the primates, and in particular the people. 
Associated with the linguistic natural result fine escalation of the sense of, because we, with the help of the words and grammar conditions can differentiate and categorise them alongside other due to ourselves. 
On the other hand, says Antonio Damasio that sentiments from more low � level of activity in the body and of the feeling areas of the cortex Hirnstammes emerge Jaak Pankseep similar, but increasingly focused on the brain stem. 
As this network in the course of human evolution have not changed very, very definitely species could be included on feelings. 
In theory, I could not, however, think it for unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues that in rats and people like fear appear, probably also felt in both cases, as in: But how could you check whether rats and people feel the same, if they behave in the same way? 
A Schabe at risk of flight, whether they also fear is? 
In my view, can mere Verhaltensähnlichkeit equality show no experience. 
It helps the neurale comparison: Rats and people have similar brain tribes, not even a brain Schaben against. 
But is the brain stem is responsible for feelings? 
And even if we could prove the for the people: As we used to prove it in rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), feelings. 
But I do not know how I should prove it. 
And because their feelings probably differ radically from our own (as the human consciousness on specific Schaltkreisen and language is based), the emotional behaviour erforsche I rather than the emotional feelings of rats. 
In any case, peddling progress here on the neural level, if we in rats and people the same measures. 
As I language and sensitivity erforsche in rats, not sentiments, I do not know whether they exist. 
It may be that for short-sighted, but I come forward rather than constantly to run up against a brick wall. 
I am a practical Emotionalist.
