The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had already revealed a few days ago, as the House of Representatives against the 700 Milliarden-Dollar-Sparpaket agreed by the White House: A large part of the Americans was and is more interested in the Wall Street rather than punish the economy to save. 
This confirmed yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reported that, as the crisis over step the Republican party divide, severing the increasingly in their old and moderate East Coast-Seele, which has always been the public institutions and the business community and those favoured neo-conservative, the "those in Washington," and the world of finance and other hostile to primarily in the south, and the centre of the states voters wins. 
This part of the party primarily owes his rise to the voice of the I mentioned above. 
This aforementioned example, however, is only a small part of the great changes that the current economic earthquake or even already announced: Not only in the United States, even in the entire West, and perhaps, on this also affected by this. 
In both states, as well as the crisis in Europe seems the long feared events to speed up the under these new conditions are finally taking shape to accept and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the recent discovery, the extraordinary renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
In fact, the crisis means a decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close links to the outside world and, at the same time, a huge amount of assets managed by private households, live in a single state. 
This means a direct political problem for the governments: Namely as it with the affected families need to act, what an enormous voters mass. 
The crisis is global so economically, politically, on the other hand, is it almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems to be sidelined in his right to speak to have lost: The obvious proof has been given by the EU, which because of their division into different national and international conflicts, a common way to find White. 
Therefore, all now count with the intrusion of the state; rescue plans, new rules, and primarily a). Distribution of aid: Since the crisis was ever more serious are the United States on the economic situation without foreign aid to save. 
And in addition to the funds also have the legitimacy to use those: Thus two cannot be value at the end of conditions in certain circumstances – – in what otherwise no international organisation and not a market can use in a similar way. 
The new emphasis on the staatlich-nationale element, is in perfectly compatible with the ever-increasing importance, the recently in the economy with a closely associated related sector: The territoriality. 
It is now very stark way than we so convinced, were long in a networked overall rich to be entered into an empire of the increasingly differentiated technologies, of the non-material that we suddenly see, as our future but more and more of the essential material things will depend, of water, harvest and oil. 
This can certainly all from one place to the other of the world will be transported, are nonetheless at extreme with a clearly defined piece of earth – a territory. 
So is the person on such a territory, a on others, in a crop yield, water unemployed or free area of oil is alive in the advantage. 
I now turn to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short way. 
Anyone who territory, who government, who policy says that say leadership. 
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand, there is the awareness of the need for Distinguished Leaderships, the need for someone who knows how it regulates. 
On the other hand, is now a wave of indignation about the existing leaders, including those primarily to the economy, which was as inadequate and full of shadow zones have explained. 
Moreover, a deeper far-reaching, and in some ways even more worrying aspect: A loss of confidence, a impatience, a picture of the futility, a sense of distance, all the a whole class of managers of Western countries. 
It seems the belief among large parts of the population to pave the way that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but their ideas world, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, are, whose salary the majority always as foreign and outdated. 
The demand for leadership feeds so an elaborate underground storage but powerful movement of the removal of the political class and the traditional political establishment. This manifested itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and the sudden shift of the collective soul, state of the last time, starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, on the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, the rebellion of American Members against Bush (and perhaps also plays the victory of the rights in Italy a role). 
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their observance, magazines, intellectuals, creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and thus less representative value of what nowadays in the bottom of the social strata of the West is going on and reinforced by the financial crisis and to Überdimensionalität driven. 
In view of all this, it would be purely exaggerated, of a "rebellion of mass" to speak. 
But the eyes wide open to keep, however, is certainly not.
