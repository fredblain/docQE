Duel on a knife edge: MP3 players against mobile phones. 
We advise you in your election 
While nearly every mobile phone MP3-Dateien, moreover, may not yet telephone MP3 player. 
Therefore it is, of course, is that it is better to buy a phone only. 
Despite this, there is plenty of reasons why we should get a stand-alone player. 
The election is of the type of use and the demands of the future owner. 
Certainly we buy it at home for a splendid expensive Plattenspieler to put out the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc to hear. 
Even such musical new features to appear not LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this. 
Have you LPs, however, with the kind of rock, jazz or Blues in the shelf, it is likely that you dream of at least one of them. 
It is also with the music on travel, with condensed music - music in a simple MP3-Format. 
Here, too, there are price and quality categories. 
For a perhaps it is not acceptable for a player to spend eight thousand kronor, but also to a Pink-Floyd-Fan headphones for twenty kronor from the market. 
Two extremes, between which it enough room for everyone. 
The selection is widespread. 
The life of the batteries is crucial. 
Some good music player for much more than just music, moreover, but what mobile phones, they do not even create an indication. 
No modern equipment are as universal as the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, the phone calls and the Simsen, may reflect music and videos, both, it has a better, sometimes a worse photo apparatus and can also perhaps way. 
And if you still the Smartphons and Kommunikatoren, it was almost a small computer in the bag. 
It is a small miracle, because no fridge can souvenir Grillen and no television. 
But the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages. 
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more often you will, however, need to shop. 
And the playing of music is one of the largest Energiefresser. 
Only a few mobile phones can music for longer than 10 12 hours are commonplace, mostly it is much less. 
In this respect, are Music player (especially the simplest) much more efficient. 
This is why you must count on the cheap mobile phones so that they do not longer than a few hours of music are commonplace. 
If you then to telephone and yet, you prefer to buy the safety a loading gear for office - and this applies to more expensive equipment. 
In MP3 players, you may not have this problem, even the less good consider at least 9 hours of operation with a time of loading. 
Another problem is, if it is the music on the mobile phone überspielen wants. 
Unfortunately, only a small part of the equipment on a USB-Abschluss, is also not every mobile phone without specific software directly to a PC. 
Of course, the music can be directly to a storage medium überspielen, but only a few cards reading equipment will be without reduction with the tiny memory cards, which are used in mobile phones. 
In the players need you to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
They need only on the machine USB-Port with music from your PC to feed. 
The majority of mobile phones and even player a music library, in an orderly fashion after the name of the performers, the title of the Albums, the genre or, for example, the assessment by users. 
Some devices are only the tree structure of the Adressverzeichnisses, similar to the Windows Explorer, certain people are both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
Players are easier to operate, more mobile phones can 
In the selection of a specific piece of equipment you should, especially after the lifespan of Akkus, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of Klangs and, of course, the Bedienkomfort back. 
You have music scene in particular and hear it every day, for example, only briefly in the trams, then enough any mobile phone to MP3-Dateien developments. 
What really can almost every mobile phone. 
They must not even particularly control what music formats, a mobile phone or a player can process. 
MP3 all create, and most of the music that you get, will be particularly in this format. 
The format is one of the most widespread, and most of the equipment also music WMA-Format shrouded in. 
Less customary is AAC (a format that Apple and its i-pods use). 
Better mobile phones also allow the purchase of music online. 
We need only on the side of a mobile Internet Providers (or of another supplier to call), and you can buy a song or album. 
This is a service that is already in itself be a sufficiently convincing argument for why we should get a music phone. 
Unfortunately, the offer of the provider is bad, and usually only limited on rapid Radiohits. 
The prices are not the lowest. 
Generally expected but that it is just this sort of selling music (be it on GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in future, the music industry will dominate. 
The mobile phone bear the most. 
If you have the inclination, to listen to something, you after the mobile phone in the with them, while the player at home is forgotten. 
It is, however, whether you always, or at least a wireless headphones Freisprecheinrichtung in themselves. 
If not, you can rely on the integrated loudspeakers, on almost every mobile phone, but only the least MP3 player. 
Probably the greatest benefit of the music mobile phones for many in the price. 
Usually the cheapest cost less than three thousand kronor. 
For three and four thousand kronor will get you a very decent Walkman. 
The biggest handicap for the majority will be that no normal headphones. 
The best and most technically advanced phones with a 3,5-mm-Öffnung for normal headphones cost of up to fifteen thousand kronor. 
The advantage of the player is the light. 
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really each service. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity in the restaurant with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or, for example, the Plattenspieler is obvious. 
There is no collision in the form of a mistaken salaried mobile Internet and then a horrendous bill for data transfers. 
The equipment should now be resort 
The cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) are generally a slot for exchange at storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.). 
Even if you a card to buy, rich two thousand kronor. 
But respect. 
In the basic models are usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB supported. 
8-GB-Speicherkarten only the most expensive can also read. 
If you already have a mobile phone and still buy a cheap MP3 player, then you are following Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, or iriver Emgeton. 
According to the capacity (Max. 2 GB) then you must not more than 1100 kronor on the table. 
You belong to the more demanding listeners, take you dear specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent Bedienknöpfe for MP3, and Bedienkomfort is so to the of an individual MP3-Players. 
Most is Sony Ericsson, the mobile phones from the series Walkman the same user interface as individually MP3 players sold. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kronor, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long Akku-Lebensdauer (usually 15 hours, a maximum of up to 35 hours) make you MP3 players of the above-mentioned manufacturers.
