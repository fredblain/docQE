Obama – the first anti-American President? A statement in this House 
A well-known American politicians, the important thing is to be regarded as an independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-american President. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, with his decisions, the economy of the United States dezimierte and with the befeindeten Islam relations used (and still is) as a private citizen. " 
The attacks on Obama are increasingly intense, particularly now, when the elections are in. 
A lady from Miami has in an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama is very smart: He thinks it will be the highest office of a nation who receive a total of two black governors and five black senators saw! ". 
However, these attacks have really not much to say; it is racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: He will be a good president? And then there are the polls; all say that Obama will win by a large margin. 
In this case, too, are people since, with the heart and not with the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her in Editorial: Only in the election booth will we know who the real American patriot his voice. 
This is a mentality of the United States, the least kept up to hide. 
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our Kreuchen whether for Obama or for McCain." 
There are people who swear: If Obama wins, will we emigrate from America. 
Something that never before heard – only now, when the success of the black candidate seems so sure. 
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 people were consulted: What mistakes has Bush during his term of office committed? 89% replied: The war in Iraq. 
America changed. 
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was with a kicks in the butt sent back home. 
4 500 soldiers in Iraq have lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to grab. 
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of the weak point of Bush. 
The person who will take his place, faces a huge task.
