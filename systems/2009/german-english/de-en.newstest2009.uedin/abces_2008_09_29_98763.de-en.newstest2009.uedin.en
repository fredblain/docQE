'I am picking up the mayor behind the stage, his character to stand', Günter Brauer, photographer. 
No paragraphs, no Rüsche, no Kostüme for the entrance. 
The nature of the great Flamencotänzer, the to the concentration and focus on the interpretation, a entspanntes appearance as a woman or a man. 
On the one hand, artists 
On the other hand, personality 
I am looking into private life, in these moments, which are alien to the audience, I know when I for the personality typical gesture, the depth of a stolen survey Ausdrückstärke or the hands, which are concerned because they do not enter the stage, can find. 
In his project 'Flamenco-people' is the German photographer Günter Bauer abwechselungsreiche drama typical of some gatherings on the stage with singers, dancers and Gitarristen. From this side, he was for the artists still little known. 
With this proposal creates the photographer a special Ikonografie the Flamencodarstellung at different levels. 
The exhibition, which the programme of the month of the photograph of the Flamenco heard, 'reflects the international importance of Flamenco, the day to day is getting bigger and bigger, is ", says the artists and makes it clear that" Flamenco-people' can be any old man, but when we look at the photos, the observer notes that there is no typical images of artists on the stage. 
Ordinary people on the portraits are artists, who are in a position on the stage passion, sadness, and joy, so that the audience. 
The personality of these artists to say, we must make no photographs on the stage. 
Their personality and her character is in their hearts. 
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere, which would allow me, with the photo camera the characters, the largest Flamencomeister canvas. 
Bauer, inspired by the Festival 'Cante de las Minas', in 1997, on a long journey, with singer, dancers Gitaristen or photographed with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the picture sorting function of the camera and the existing material, pictures of classic photograph. 
The application of different stylistic means destroying the traditional basis of the picture, making the picture modernity and the idea, as the farmer Flamenco understands awarded to be: 'Music with traditional roots, the changed and every day' surprise. 
These are not only of the dance, the singing or the Instrumentalspiel itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, his art with the audience blinds. 
The search for the essence, after some results, which, in the form of the Hörens, of being visible, and was the firm objective of this work in the next period in the gallery of the El Fotómata presented. 
Well-known personalities in Flamenco including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente crony and other are among the close selection of almost 70 artists who have been photographed. 
The project has been a Anthologie of Flamencos and will soon as book, with all the portraits from the exhibition, appearing. 
Bauer ’ s passion to the portraits led him to this idea two years ago to take up again and as a 'portraits of the veterans of the sport' ('game to implement Project'). 
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are varied, gives the photographer to 'it like very much photographed people, they know to learn, and in their lives to enable state whether for a brief moment or a long time. 
I think that in the area of the photograph the portrait is the most difficult breed. 
Du triffst you or encountering people, people who sometimes do not even know, or they can leave you alone for a few minutes, a photo. 
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to achieve my ideas. '
