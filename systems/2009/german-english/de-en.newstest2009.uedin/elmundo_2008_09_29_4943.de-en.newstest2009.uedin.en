Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
On the 'emerging Technology Conference', am there from MIT, Microsoft has the progress of the new picture detection system and Mensch-Interaktion presented, a system of artificial intelligence without a lot of intelligence, which is capable, however, to do some primitive tasks, such as a taxi order (or in the case of Microsoft is the one routes planners, on the campus of the company to move). The system observed what it during the entertainment. 
Thanks to a camera and a violation of form and face detection system, can this' Rezeptionistin 'see how many people in the area of who they are and even remember, as they were held, it can listen and the key words of their entertainment understand. 
It is also the present after the talks in the groups view. 
In the presentation video noticed Rezeptionistin ',' a third person, but she understands that this person to the group, with their conversation, is not, and that no company employee. 
They ask about whether the person who wants to come here and he replies that they will soon be listening. 
Everything without the blue Screenshot 
Very impressive 
This is certainly the future. 
Now the company has better things on which it can focus, for example, to the next version of its operating system Windows. 
This week we spoke very superficial on the change of strategy by Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be more quickly and not so many eingebundene programmes have. 
Steve Ballmer, established that if the computer would be equipped with the necessary, rather than with the commercial waste filling, so they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that is only for the few. 
Everything is just a statement, given that Microsoft Windows versions in one or other function well 'and' extras. 
The change of direction is worth 
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing in importance, just as the software. 
As a Google chromium appeared in the network, was the part of the theory that it was the first step of Google in order to compete with Windows. 
Thickly sent many indications that the Browser no operating system. 
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to ensure that hardware and software at the same time, can function. 
The operating system delivers the role with the operation of his wife or his or her husband can be compared when it comes to something to tell his mother-in-law. 
That is true. 
The system will never disappear, but it must be to its' death ', not as an absolute, but rather as a relative truth, thinking. 
What Ballmer, said this week is the confirmation of this idea. 
The people pay less attention to every time the operating system, more the Web-Browser. 
The computer will be launched at the Firefox, the Explorer or chromium execute and every day we spend more time on surfing, than in the vicinity of the 'window'. 
What serves half in the computer of existing applications? 
Less is more 
And Windows 7 is more compact, much more compact than vista. 
Light, not so exaggerated, less complicated. 
The interest of Microsoft's is longer to integrate its online services, then, the alternative to Google. 
In reality, they need it, without a doubt. I express a small example of this. 
The photograph of this place I have in Redmond, in one of the recovery rooms for Microsoft, employees at the beginning of the month. 
On the Erfrischungsgetr√§nkeautomat is fitted a shield: 'Your quest. Our future'. It prints a request from, own tool for Online-Suche to use it. 
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that the 66% of workers in Microsoft, Google for the research in the network used. 
Incidentally, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 in the delay is falling. 
They will not start, but at the end of 2009 are, even in 2010. 
Microsoft is seeking the possibility of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time to bring on the market. 
Turns every day the telephone in a computer. 
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
