Intelligent car copied the flight of the Hummel 
What would be the best method for the development of new technologies to accident prevention, if not the Hindernis-Sensoren from the natural to imitate? 
For example, the of the bees. 
At the CEATEC Japan was a startling project presented, in which the Nissan-Ingenieure of Hummeln in the creation of new accident vermeidender systems were inspired. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University Autorobotern Nissan the controlled type biomimetische system BR23C built a Mini-Auto, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. 
Any bee in the air is their own, oval "private sector," which our own "shield" is very similar, said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for Technologie-PR and research development, in the exhibition. 
The eye of the bee up in any direction and in a corner of over 300 degrees can see, plays a major role. 
The function of the kind to imitate eye, the researchers blew the idea of Knife lasergesteuerten gap. 
It identifies BR23C obstacles in the face in a field of 180 degrees within 2 metres, their long distances and sends signals to the Mikroprozessor on Board, which immediately precedes the kollisionsvermeidenden process. 
The barrier will be registered in a split second, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by the tyre at the relevant corner spin. 
Unlike previous systems take place this ploy rather than purely instinctively. 
"If it were not so, the car robots could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the "Laboratory (TRL) mobility" and Autoroboter-Projektes. 
The system must react instinctively, and immediately, because the technology the innermost and most vulnerable part of us from recession - is a class, within the accidents are currently still considered inevitable. 
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if they other bees. 
And that must be conducted in the fraction of a second. 
However, the exile, in contrast to the bee, not upwards, down, or even diagonal be done - it can only be developed along two dimensions, and only in the direction of the tyres Wendbarkeit. 
During the bee here are infinitely many options open to sidestep other bees, the researchers were in the car robot only the Drehbewegung, or of speeding up and Abbremsens serve. 
The BR23C contains Lithium-Polymerbatterien, the easier and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer life than traditional Lithium-Ionenbatterien. 
Andoh said that it will be on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and still less on the ability to store them. 
This device per second only a few inputs must process and respond appropriately to them. 
It must not store them, or on the basis of previous exercises an intuitive, logical response produce, so that there are just a handful of KB Memory. 
There is no need for Gigabyte- and Megabyte-schwerer Memories. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, the reckoning of Nissan within the next ten years serial moderately in production will be. 
A further application could find the technology in GPS-Satellitennavigation by the motorist aware around barriers and draws him as the target.
