A name for the sündteure child 
We have the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar serious Rettungspaket-Gesetzes before that in several stages will be applied and on the purchase of the bad loans from the banks. 
In the first round the half of the money should be spent. 
In a meeting on Saturday after midnight local time to an end east coast, after the Members of Congress mehrtägigen debates to an agreement on the course 700-Milliarden-Dollar heavy rescue package, Reuters reported. 
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic President in the American Congress, and said that we should use the agreement only on paper. 
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on the result: The programme will be efficient and it will be effective, but we must do more. According to Pelosi were not talking about the rescue of Wall Street, but about the helm of the economy rumzureißen. 
The written version of the package was before the opening of the Asian markets, in other words, Washington time Sunday evening 8 p.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), published, however, has no inspired on the stock. 
On Monday the House is first on the draft law to stabilise the economy of 2008, then the Senate in the series. 
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday night with Pelosi, and also the White House welcomed the news of the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress made in the middle of the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to promote stability in our markets and our economy to protect, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House. 
The programme, however, is different from the original recommendation from the Bush administration that the 700 billion dollars on again for the purchase of the lazy, with loans of strain in the securities should be spent. 
In a first tranche is to a maximum of half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages spent, and 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the issue on Monday. This amount to the purchase of the strain in the credit, bad securities will be spent, and on the further USD 100 billion to the President to decide. 
The programme will be reviewed by a own Commission, the president of the Federal Reserve is a member. 
The other half of the 700 billion depend on a further decision of Congress. 
In the spirit of the law, the Treasury can also apply a combined tactics: At the same time it is bad loans, mortgages, and with mortgages purchased using securities and other "toxic" loans. 
As competent people of the Ministry reported to the purchase both in an auction, and directly. 
The law allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance programme, in which the Treasury guarantees the worrying resources, and the companies are expected to damage the appropriate pay fees. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary resources so that up to 700 billion dollars as emergency aid for the American financial system can be made available, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad resources, their insurance, or the prevention of a systemic risk by the collapse of a major financial institution will be triggered. 
The necessary steps are, so that we are prepared for the introduction of the law, as soon as it was signed, so Paulson. 
The head of the troubled and now reliant on government aid, however, banks can expect their Abfertigungen, the overseas long casual "golden handshake called" will be cut by the government. 
Reducing the pay will only be in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury aushilft each. 
The cut essentially means that if the Ministry in the framework of an auction buying, the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the outgoing head of banks in the pension deported. 
In the case of a direct purchasing the moldy lending aggressively, making the government to ensure that the managers ’ salaries are not excessive. 
The picture also heard that the existing Golden Handshake-Verträge not be changed - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that the more people to participate in the programme. 
This is the first case in American history that cuts in Manager-Gehältern be regulated by law, commenting on the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure. 
The state gains rights of participation in the participating banks, so that the risk to the taxpayer is falling, because they can also take part, as soon as the economy and hence the rescued bank is better. 
The draft law stipulates that the President of the Congress in the next five years must submit a proposal, as the taxpayers their lost money from the financial sector get back again. 
However, there were skeptics on both sides, in relation to the plan have expressed their doubts. 
That is not what the American people expect of us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, the Californian Republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures were propelled by the same people who also for the collapse of Wall Street are responsible.
