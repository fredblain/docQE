USA. The financial collapse has left its mark on journalists: In the newspapers can be hit by the cuts. And many accuse the internet, "murderers" of the written press. 
Five hundred American journalists have been by the Pew Research Center on their situation and their mental control concerning the future consulted. 
Today, almost all journalists pessimistic what their future. 
Nevertheless, they said to the information on responsible people not really concerned about the general credibility. 
They do not feel as alone as before. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model, which was destroyed. 
The major problems from the Newsroom telling cuts, the area in which the editors work, the newspaper put together. 
It is a problem that has to be solved – the interviewten journalists – if you want to prevent that the traditional journalism, as the big audience it understands, not much is disappearing. 
A clear, but more complicated pessimism is the American journalist. 
Six of ten journalists and executive Seniors of the written press are of the opinion that the journalism at national level on the wrong track. 
In the local area is it in the Executives even to the 65%. 
Print vs. broadcast. 
It is not difficult for the journalists, imagine the direction that the web. 
The most important publishing groups pave the way to the Internet, which by many as the "killer" of the printing press is seen. 
The "economic pressure" that the journalists felt, is increased by up to 79%. 
The 500 interviewten journalists have admittedly, the new technology to want to join in the hope "they express something positive for the journalism". 
The biggest rift in American journalism today between the editors of the newsroom and the reporters that the working for them. 
56% of the editors at national level are certain, their reporters share their values with them, while it at a local level only 23%. 
Some think it has with the "safety in the work" to do. 
The managers, worried that their work within three years to lose $47% at national level. 
The journalists are it 30%. 
The issue of "safe work" in the team (our editors', Anm. d. Red.) is in the United States is always a topical issue. 
Only 13% of the journalists to work under contract. 
In a vast nation, as it is the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV-Sendern and Internet operators offer the employer as it pleases them and so it will be a question of take it or leave it. 
The editors have very often very high wages, the editor, however, can sometimes get only 10, 000 euros per month, pension and insurance funds. 
What the holiday, the issue is complex: A certain amount of days in the first year, and so many after the third, finally, after a number of years to achieve 15 vacation days. 
But the American journalists are, as they themselves admit, in the course of the year often "sick". 
It is a question of the climate.
