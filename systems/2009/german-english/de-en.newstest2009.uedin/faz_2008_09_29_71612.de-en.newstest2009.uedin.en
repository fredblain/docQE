In Frankfurt Düsseldorfer hopes 
In big words lack in the letter of the WestLB-Vorstands to the staff of the House. 
By a coming together of the Institute Düsseldorfer money with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank "could the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe", it says in the letter on Monday reported. 
The advertisers by WestLB, a "competence block" with sustainable profitability in such a business. 
And could such a link of the decisive impetus to further Bündelungen banking sector in the country. 
So reads it, if a board of ability to act in a difficult time to demonstrate. 
The wounded by WestLB, still is under tremendous pressure. 
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for securities regulator, which the government nordrhein-westfälischen country recently has made it clear that the time is pushing, a future solution to be found. 
Of a sort of link between the Deka-Bank, the savings bank customers for their investment funds are aware, and the by WestLB, however, is for some time - the speech at Frankfurt side. 
Although it has Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas in the presentation of the half-yearly figures to the end of August, in a merger of the House to the Mainzer highway with a country bank Helaba or by WestLB, for example, see it would make no sense. 
But has the Board of the Deka, the half from each of the country, banks and building societies were going associations, the Board mandated, with the by WestLB talks on joint business activities. 
This could it that capital market business or parts of them go. 
The talks are, however, as stated in the financial centre, has only just begun. 
Of the Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 members of the more important employers at the City of Frankfurt, is not the first time the speech when it for consolidation in the sector is building societies. 
In 2003, it looked for a moment as from, as if the Deka-Bank with the country bank Helaba Rhineland-Palatinate and merge. 
From this tripartite federal was, however. 
Hardly the plans were publicly become, said the government Hessische country against a participation of Helaba out from. 
The other two houses were not next to each other. 
The country Bank Rhineland-Palatinate instead went to the country Bank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. 
But has it again on a combination of ideas Deka-Bank with land banks. 
Recently, however, had Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, against plan games on a combination with his home. 
Regardless of the verdict but seems to mature that a together the various houses of the public sector is suffering. 
After the Land election in Bavaria is over, could the first a combination of bank BayernLB with the country näherrücken Baden-Württemberg. 
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news. 
Should the pressure to further mergers rise, going to get the partner for it. 
In the south would be they become junior partner, although so far the financial crisis has experienced far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A combination with the West LB, in turn, has the Sparkassen- Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen and, with 85 percent of the Helaba, is the beginning of the year, put a stop to it. 
Would remain if anything, the North LB. 
Such geostrategic considerations are but only one side. 
On the other there is the question of how the different business models of the individual houses to each other. 
In June expressed Merl, the key issue facing the business model is the future ability of the country to ensure banks should be by the Germans Sparkassen- Giroverband and so far not been answered. 
In the end, could also be a cutting of the West LB, which, of course, there is not wanted. 
So is in the letter of the local board of directors, the talk, it will in any case a "global solution" to the House. 
As with the combination of individual units with the Deka-Bank together can bring, will still show.
