Sylvana and the secrets of Bento-Box 
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of the Tachibana High School to present, catching the girl to kichern: The Germans is totally "kawaii"! 
What this means? 
Sylvana knows the word from Mangas - in the new Austausch-Log tells them from Japan. 
"The first day of school in Japan. 
I was excited. 
I had even before the Schulweg Bammel. 
I live on the edge ’ s towards Kawasaki and drive around 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School. 
I had to find the way alone, fortunately, I was not proceeded. 
The starting class seems Tachibana not as strict as laid down at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils from 8 p.m. takes a until about twenty nine a brief meeting round with the teacher begins, the 'home' room. 
But, before the teaching began, I was in the series, pleased to present. 
However, I am not the type who likes to talk to people, even from a class of 40 pupils. 
Because I still had no Schuluniform, I have an old rock of my host mother attracted, blouse, blue knees assets and black leather shoes. 
In this lift I have put before the bench and tried to make things right: "Sayonara where she Sylvana... '- I welcome Sylvana, come from Germany and have birthday in a week. 
At the moment, I was very glad that I have a little over two years beginning, had to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class have all getuschelt, sniggering gewunken and constantly, and I have the word "Kawaii". 
The knew I have from my Mangas. 
It is of vital importance to vocabulary of Japanese girls and means' cute and sweet '. 
Then I am quickly to my seat gehuscht. 
The girl beside me took a very broad gegrinst, they thought it was an honour that the Austauschschülerin sitting next to her. 
The rest of the day was relatively quiet, but as the chorus of Gong, I was almost bombarded overflowing. 
All were kicherten muddle and asked me and holes in the stomach - is it real hard to understand Japanese English. 
In the break packten then all their Bentos. 
My host mother had also made me as a Lunchbox - that is something other than the tedious German Pausenbrote. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in Tofumantel. 
Mostly I have no glimmer of bland, what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
Things to see strange from and unparalleled taste. 
The fact is that everything is real lecker. 
Well, until the plum salzig lodged perhaps, brrrr. 
The Bentos in Japanese schools are not only simply lunch. 
It is sometimes before that a girl a boys Bento pays a plate of itself, which they particularly skilful herrichtet - in the hope that the boys in the Pausensnack closer to experience. 
That I have in my Manga-Comics read. 
Sometimes, I am interested to see if I can watch it here. 
'Why it is Japan?', I have asked my friends, when I told them that I for one year in Tokyo wants to go to school. 
I have always said: 
"Because it fascinated me now." 
Finally, I read for years Mangas prefer. 
And I the comics and the culture is better understand that at some point, I have also begun to learn a bit remained in Japanese. 
For me was therefore absolutely clear that I had to be here at some point. 
Because I also have a penchant for tradition, customs and practices. 
And the places we great value. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is tough, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well organized, I have not yet felt lost here, although Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen. "
