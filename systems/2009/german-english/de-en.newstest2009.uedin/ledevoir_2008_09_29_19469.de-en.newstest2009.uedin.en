Meeting - from the blood that safe again was 
Yesterday Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. 
And, above all, has it public confidence restored, the by the scandal by the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s, was shaken. 
As we know, were the from the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross national blood reserves managed during the 1980's with HIV and hepatitis C virus contaminated. 
In the face of this tragedy and the public discontent led the government of Canada in February 1994, a public, by the judge Horace Krever led an investigation, the objective was to bring light into the circumstances that had led to a tragedy of this nature, and directives, a fresh disaster in order to prevent this type. 
While judges Krever even hesitate to make his report, then, several provinces of a committee on its feet, whose goal it was to a new system for managing blood in Canada to develop. 
In Quebec, met the committee Gélineau this task. 
According to the reports by Gélineau and Krever were founded in Canada two blood banks: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, the other provinces and the two territories to take care. 
'1998, when their work has included Hema-Quebec, 38% of people had little confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers, Dr Décary. 
The situation was disappointing. 
Through the enormous efforts to ensure the safety of the blood and to improve the work in this area during the following years, we have to win back the confidence of the public ", says it before it proud stressed that the beginning of 2008 now almost 94% of the population of Quebec Hema-Quebec had confidence in. 
However, Dr Décary reserves in the knowledge that 'trust is a very fragile ". 
Since its founding on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec is, according to the principle of caution. 
At that time we saw the emergence of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe with, a new type of the disease, told this woman since 1998, the leadership. 
"And we had not the slightest idea whether these disease on the blood could be transferred. 
So we have heard on one of the main guidelines of the reports by Krever and Gélineau to the exclusion of measures to be applied, and when you do not know if the disease progresses slowly, as is clear in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that has run through a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death. 
So we took in April 1999, no blood of people on, since 1980, more than a month in the United Kingdom had stopped. 
Now, a few years ago, it was undoubtedly proved that this disease transmitted by blood. 
This event has shown that the principle of caution, which we would apply, is indeed a meaning. 
In 1999, appeared on the market a much more precise technology to detect HIV: The Nukleinsäure-Tests (NST), which will make it possible to directly in the blood of the donor to prove the existence of the virus itself, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as in the tests used to date. 
The NST enabled it to shorten the incubation period, between the time when the person was infected and that if the first viruses through our techniques can be detected in the blood, is taking place, explains the specialist. 
This time in a period of less than a week to be reduced. 
Thus, the risk that some donors could be infected, without being aware of it, and we could not see much reduced. 
These improvements enabled it to the risk of AIDS through a blood transfusion to transfer to a considerable degree. 
Today, there is a risk of 12 million people, with HIV infected blood to preserve. 
"In other words, this means that you should distribute 12 million blood before someone infected with HIV. 
Since Hema-Quebec every year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood distributed, it would take more than 24 years before a occurs in the HIV on a Blutkonserve was transferred. 
I believe that it can now feel well, if we get a blood transfusion or, in order to restore the health ', says the Direktionschefin of Hema-Quebec. 
"Our challenge for the next ten years it is, the safety of our products. 
We will never know which germs can come into the system. 
Only last year, which is on the island of Réunion Chikungunya-Virus appeared, the, just as the Westnil-Virus, by insects transmitted by blood. 
We must monitor incessantly, drives Dr Décary further before they stressed that, in addition to a safe supply Hema-Quebec also provide an adequate supply. 
"The demand is rising, because the population is getting older. 
As the treatment of aggressive cancer are often the patients need new red blood cells or Blutplättchen. 
The ageing of the population also impacts on the blood donor network from which an average of only 3% of the blood donations are appropriate inhabitants of Quebec. ' 
It can any healthy person, of the 18 years or older is and the eligibility criteria all 56 days, six times a year to give blood. 
On average, to be 14% of people that their blood available, not accepted because they, for example, of AIDS or malaria are ill, and who has been in a country where malaria is prevalent, for a year by the blood donations excluded. 
"With these 3% will we make it, an inventory to preserve what the needs of the hospitals. 
A lack of supplies are very rare. 
But we must renew the Members of this donor network if they get older and are no longer able to donate blood. 
It is hard to convince the people, to donate blood, but, above all, to keep them and to produce regular donors. 
Life is now so hectic that you rarely find the time, an hour in the blood donation to spend ', regrets Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of $297 million Hema-Quebec provides not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin, almost exclusively for serious violations of fire is used. 
This tissue to be investigated, processed and frozen before they are Hema-Quebec stored, the only public cord blood bank Quebec managed. 
In the umbilical cord, in the past, was viewed as a biomedical waste, is rich in stem cells, blood, which can serve, serious diseases, such as leukemia to deal with. 
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the stockpiling of our thousand TENs umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan, every year, more than a thousand wane. 
"We should start at the beginning of next year, available for transplants to ask", said Dr Décary, this programme of umbilical cord blood as a very popular decline. 
"Many mothers are convinced, no such access to have ', because Hema-Quebec lack the resources, this complex and costly programme in all hospitals to offer of Quebec.
