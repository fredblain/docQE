Believers have less pain? 
As the latest research results show that religious belief as a kind of "painkiller" all honesty, which already have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs. 
Scientists of the Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It was investigated whether belief in God the pain of the people affected, reported the British "Telegraph saying". 
In the wake of the rather bizarre investigation ever received 12 believers and atheists electric shocks while they studied a painting of the mother of God. 
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate the bulk of the pain. 
By means of a Hirn-Scan technology could even be demonstrated that the Catholics were able to activate the part of her brain, which is responsible for the pain of regulation. 
The study was the first in a research project that also alongside scientists, philosophers and theologians of various departments in the university. 
The attempt was one of the subjects funkelndes device attached to the left hand, which made the electric shocks. 
The participants were asked to hard to concentrate on two paintings: On the one hand, a picture of the mother of God, painted of Sassoferrato, in the 17th century, and on the other hand, Leonardo da Vincis "lady with the Hermelin." 
The researchers hoped that the sight of these young Mrs Maria among the believers would provoke a kind of religious blossom, while it identified as Vincis picture, because it is very different from the other paintings and was seen as a reassuring. 
People ever spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electric shocks in this time in four stages, while they either the religious, or the other paintings should regard. 
Catholics report that they had the sight of the mother of God "in security" felt as if they "surrounded by", and they would be "peace and quiet". 
During the Betrachtens of religious Gem√§ldes they have about 12% reported less pain than if they Leonardos station had in mind. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, also attended the attempt, said that it could be similar effects, also with other, strong images also operating in the atheists, they should be just the photo. 
"We would have to find a picture, the very positive sentiments, such as a mother or father," the psychologist. 
The Anglikanische Bishop Tom Wright, welcomed the results of the research. 
"The practice of the faith should change our personality, and do it in many cases," Wright. 
After these excellent results, the only question is, what effect a Madonna-Bild Leonardos or other comparable Malers on the pain regulation of believers. 
Would the high-quality young Mrs Maria even achieve better results?
