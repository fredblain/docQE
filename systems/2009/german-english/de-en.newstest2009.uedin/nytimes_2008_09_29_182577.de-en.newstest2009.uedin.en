The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, in a city of the special kind 
Hidden between the excesses of the leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glitzernden, noisy and gigantic activities, is a calm city in which the pride and the complications of the shadows afro-amerikanischen culture. 
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the city Hurstons Zora Neale, is no longer so easy to describe it as Hurston in 1935 did: "The city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers do end up drinking it, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." 
Today, it is a pilgrimage site. 
Alice Walker, had Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee are for the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville come at the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance to memory. 
And yet is and remains the city that it describes – and it into a tourist excursion goal made by them in the Florida travel leaders began, to periods of depression by the German writer project has been produced in many ways a place of particular variety. 
Eatonville is so independent, and private as sound overall in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities often refused in Florida, their true idea with the weissen man to share, "so little about us know that he does not know what escapes him." 
Even today, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama to an open dialogue on race relations, there are still many here had to be monitored by Aussenseitern. 
"We are very anxious as our story is told," Hortense Jones, 59, from birth, a resident of the town and community member of the oldest church in the city. 
It must vote. " 
Eatonville was for a long time as a paradox of triumph and the fight defined. 
It is both an historic example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2.400 inhabitants, in the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
On the one hand it is a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes convicted, sometimes touted - black culture of the rural South, its roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that people here both proud and on the hat. 
And so it began the concerns about Eatonville's image with Zora, as everyone Hurston call. 
It questioned the world their city, in books, which came from heart and in Mundart were written as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) 
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel leaders modified the city, which is quite near the route 77, a street oft-vergessene centre by Florida leads to the scene of black history and human tragedy. 
Smart as Oskar, both in real life and in the literature, led to the shop Hurston reader of Eatonvilles first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned privateren affairs. 
"On the left side of the road," wrote it, "is the brown -weiss angestrichene modern school, with its leafy gardens and game seats, the always attended Howard Miller, although it hardly can read and write." 
They also mentioned the new man from widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "drinks of any kind was-auch-immer and sold to hours rooms suits." 
In only a few hundred words Hurston Eatonville brought so with even government in connection, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was certainly not a trip leader. 
In fact, this was not a Portrait, which by all estimated. 
"Zora described it as they were," the 90 year-old Dinkins Ella, one of the Johnson-Mädchen the Hurston verewigte by the men quoted, the songs on their beauty sang, the full of sexual innuendo. 
She added: "Some people liked this not." 
We remember here Hurtson still as a lively Exzentrikerin, the regelmässig returned after their family after Jacksonville, Florida, was drawn. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, reminded that if Hurston gebraust came in the city, they usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, rauchend and with trousers, which even today in a city with its venerable clothing style einbildet. 
According to Mr Franklin were the majority of the inhabitants fascinated, whereas many of you despise. 
"The people were Zora always glad to see," said Mr Franklin. 
But "she was never too long," he added while he was in his chair schaukelte, on a terrace backfired situated on the Sabelia sea to look to the Hurston in all likelihood was baptised. 
As Hurston died in 1960 it was poor and their books produced enough. 
Along with the majority of the world Eatonville they seemed to have forgotten. 
Although they were once a famous author was a Zeitgenössin long Tin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920ern, was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they lived, buried in an unmarked grave. 
In Eatonville there were no major commemoration ceremony, no public readings on a large scale. 
"I am not thinking that they their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least understood," Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of the 2003 Hurston was published. 
The turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the town, at the Kennedy Boulevard to replace the slow two-lane main street of the community. 
Orlandos suburbs have already had the motorway 4 through the western outskirts. 
The proposal was introduced as Eatonville still of a difficult time recovering in its history. 
Forced integration, among other things, had the relatively idyllic isolation of the community a definite end. 
In the 1950s the fight against racial mixing hatred in the community. 
"In this time was often a bunch of white boys and throwing oranges and stuff on the people who sit on the sidelines," said Mr Franklin. 
"It was even once a woman the killing was. 
Throwing a Wassermelone from the car. " 
In 1955 Hurston behind asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the call of the Supreme Court, integration to force by its decision in the case against the Schulrat Brown as "offensive will my race respektierend" called. 
Today, residents say that although the lifting of racial segregation was positively in some respects, the groups in the cohesion Eatonville and self-assurance weakened its young people. 
"Black children were used to it, hugged to be - I remember hug, one of his teachers in the morning and his teachers hug on the evening," N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and Managing Director of the non-profit group for the protection of Eatonville Community. 
This could be maintained as long, they added, until teachers and pupils came more from the same place. 
"They embraced his white teachers do not, because he was a white teacher - I mean is a cultural divide in place," said Mrs Nathiri. 
However, the civil rights have contributed to that room for further Zora Neale Hurstons was created - black writers, actors and artists who sat on prejudice, as they did with a positive self-esteem and statements such as: 'How can anyone deny the joy of my society! 
I understand it not. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker was on the way to Hurstons anonymous grave and began for the revival of their glory to fight. 
Five years later, was a much promised Hurston-Biographie of Robert E. Hemenway shelves in the books, and made them again to a part of the American Literaturkanons. 
The long-distance road project came exactly at a time in the most famous daughter Eatonvilles once again in the public eye. 
And this time Hurstons old neighbours saw it as Retterin. 
The community began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival in order to demonstrate what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January sweep many for the ceremony. 
A few years later wrote the district of its road-building plans. 
"The plans of a five piecemeal highway crowded the city, accelerated the whole thing with the top speed, set real citizens proud," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Madam Boyd put it somewhat simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the long-distance road project has to a change in the image of the city itself. 
There were more and more course travelled as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who since 1993 is here in the church, and residents began to appreciate the past. 
In 1998 Eatonville was in the nationwide historic register. 
A new einstöckige library (of course) opened after Hurston appointed in 2006 on the neugepflasterten and verschönerten Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today Eatonville is still a feature in Florida: Only 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos can they sometimes feel like a Hintergasse anfühlen in the summer of rain, as small as at that time as they of only 27 black families in the 1880ern was created. 
(It is today to 90% black.) 
Outsiders in search of the history Eatonvilles and its importance are still often treated with caution. 
For most of the interviews is a approval in the run-up to necessary and certain things - as the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles eldest Church, which was painted by a Weissen and black men in the field work is - must not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a bold, assertive teacher with a preference for Dunkelrot, still fear that their abgeschirmte Community is misunderstood. 
And yet, at the same time to the Hurston-Festival greater, was also a greater degree of home pride born. 
Young people in particular tend to see Hurston Eatonville as their entire race saw: Beautiful, with all its problems, either worse or better and just as proud, creative and hardworking, ridiculous and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America. 
It is the sincere love for this city of the people in the voice of Mr Franklin nephew can hear, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return after Eatonville, in the town of administrative or the police to work, which he could use a little help. 
And even younger people, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville right. 
"Most people who only pass through here, will be thinking: 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the other," said the other day Alondra Kenon on Sunday after the church. 
"But if one really stop and for a moment in its history, it is a very nice city."
