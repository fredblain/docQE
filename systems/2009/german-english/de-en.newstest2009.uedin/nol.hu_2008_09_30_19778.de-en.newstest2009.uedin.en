Lukaschenko-Opposition: 110-0 
In Sunday's elections has not a member of the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament. 
Russian observers think that this lies in the prosperity and stability in the by Alexander Lukashenko's country, the OECD, however, suspects illicit goings-on in the counting of votes. 
The OECD, the 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections. 
De term is the 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates for decades without opposition from, but has the under the name of "United Democratic Forces (ODS) rallied against party before yesterday ’ s elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, the in the Ugly Elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment 2006 his presidential mandate for the fourth time renewed, this time a few members of the opposition in Parliament 'permit would". 
That is why the ODS even of the previously planned boycotts gap. 
Ukraine is thanks to the rising price of gas, imports of ever more dependent on Russia economically. For the relief of the price increases were even credits included, and the country also has the sell-off of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline through the country, leading to the Russians. In the light of the expectations of the opposition was thus the hope that Ukraine wants to improve its relations with the EU, after Lukashenko and other senior politicians because of the classified as anti-democratic political system in the EU travel ban. 
For a temporary relaxation, the evaluation report of the elections of the OECD, in which the emphasis on the positive movements, rather than the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidate from the elections - was. 
However, the quickly criticized the OECD report on Monday, the campaign - that the opposition should not occur in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition in the counting of votes was allowed to be present. 
Despite this, the opposition can see an improvement in the political system: Some political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is even smaller confrontation with Moscow by the recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia denied, although Russia, with the Ukraine on paper a Föderativstaat forms, the two regions as independent for a month. 
"We have two steps forward and a backwards made, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our tables. 
According to the opposition candidate for the presidential elections of 2006 is a continuation desirable, although "the powerful jitters also have only one opposition members of parliament to be". 
The opposition is not planning any protest action in the face of the results, but rather trying the need for economic reform to the voters. 
"We have here with many problems to overcome the opposition newspapers - must be printed in Russia, the local authorities are getting in the way of the distribution, but I see that more and more people support the change, even the elderly," said Milinkevich in allusion to the fact that not even the most aid layer of the Pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose sole merit the production of social security. 
"Thanks to the debt of the country and the rise in the trade deficit is just a matter of time before the to the silence of a Friedhofes gemahnende 'social security" is beginning to crumble, "Milinkevich. 
Unlike the opposition politicians have Russian observers described the elections as democratic. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the deeds, and not words." The lack of the opposition is therefore a test of the maturity of the Belarussian electorate.
