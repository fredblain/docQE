Dark matter Raumsonden influenced flight 
For years, creating a mysteriöses phenomenon has been scrapped in for confusion: Dark Matter influences the speed of Raumsonden during so-called Swing-by-Manöver. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein's not quite true could be. 
The spacecraft went almost 18 years flew "Ulysses" by the space. 
Because soon gefrierenden fuel pipelines now threatening the die of cold. 
Among scientists for years, a ensure mysteriöses phenomenon for confusion - the Swing-by-Anomalie. 
The Swing-by is a manoeuvres of Raumsonden, during which they gravitating additional momentum in a blue body, around the world. 
By the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The Euro-American Forschungssonde Cassini-Huygens used these physical ploy as well as the Ulysses Sonnensonde. 
What the researchers have for years, but surprises: The aircraft do not behave perfectly suited to be like it after the ancient Gravitationsgesetz expected. 
Rather, it is to irregularities in the speed. 
The probes are unexpectedly speed up or slow down. 
So far, the physicist this effect could not explain. 
They tauften Swing-by-Anomalie him. 
Some experts fear that may even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, the attraction of matter by a curvature of the area describes, not quite true could be. 
The American physicist Stephen eagle from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein erred not, and the Swing-by-Anomalie with the help of the so-called dark matter to explain the Astronomen identified in the universe. 
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which is also very near the planet could decide," he wrote. 
Of the existence of dark matter know the space researchers for only ten years ago. 
She is obviously an appeal, the effect on other blue body itself can be seen. 
They, on the other hand, is totally invisible, in other words, it sends out and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, in particular is also no visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists makes the dark matter after all, well over a fifth of the whole of the mass of the universe.
