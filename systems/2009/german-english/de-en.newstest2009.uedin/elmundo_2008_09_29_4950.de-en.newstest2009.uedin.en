For the Olympic Games are the roads in Madrid. 
Yes, the dream of many of us, some Olympic disciplines in Madrid to stage, following the failure of 2012, there can be but perhaps 2016. 
But I ask myself, 'are we prepared for?' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say that it is not true! 
It has been described as the perfect streets, and in my opinion, then, it was the worst road with particular point of beating about, there was. 
Of course, it is a lot of nonsense, if you take into account the assessment would look at it and I would be so what clearly not accepted. 
But, we go by from the outset. 
The nonsense begins with the ticket to bring that allows you, as the first to go. 
It also seems to me to be a good thing, but if you do it right, then it should also give you everything (including chip, the congestion on the street to avoid). 
But not so. 
Here you let them just the ticket bring (the first nonsense which consists of only to go then) and (after an endless queues) as is the surprise, there were only the satirical t-shirt like the size of 'S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL) 
Where we live in fact? 
Or is it, then, that the next crisis became only small, much cheaper shirts from less substance to buy? 
Well, matters like these are a small matter compared to the days on the streets. 
Apart from the fact that we very early to go in order to get the chip, is already a queues of at least 15 minutes and, furthermore, it must be the schoolbag. 
The wait has lasted more than 35 minutes, as in the case of a street, where 11 000 people are expected is incomprehensible. 
Finally, as it was to be expected, began in the streets and we had our Rücksäcke are not before, even if it was successful, but they call back would be more difficult. 
It also saw it, in those 40 minutes waiting period after rain from, so that it came to the temptation, a popular uprising to organise and to invade the Häuschen. 
I believe that morning will certainly have some 500 people of pneumonia and some as I be because this chip, which I, not even in time for the classification, I am thinking that the outcome was wrongly branded. 
Of course, if you ask me for a perfect street would, it would never occur to me. 
So, I believe we will still dream of a city for the Olympic Games is well prepared
