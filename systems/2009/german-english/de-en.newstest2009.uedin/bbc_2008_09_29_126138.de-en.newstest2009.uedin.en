Housing construction companies have B & B costs in 
British housing companies could after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley bank costs of more than 80 million pounds into the house. 
The government was 14 billion pounds available for the deposit of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers to protect. 
The interest on the loans will be paid by all companies to get the money from investors, including 59 Baugesellschaften 
The Director General of the Association of housing companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "intolerable" that the societies and their members would have to pay. 
The 14 billion at the end of the loan will be repaid if Bradford & Bingleys loans are eliminated. 
But in the meantime interest rates will be accumulated each year, 700 of those financial firms, the payments. 
The programme for the compensation of financial services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing societies are included in that number. 
It is ironic that those institutions in a sensible things... now be called for some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.

It said that every company in relation to the deposit, who think that it would have to pay, and that the companies together around 18% of the costs would have to pay. 
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan to 450 million pounds in 2009 will amount. 
This means that the societies 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year must obtain. 
Adrian Coles, director-general of the Association of housing societies, told the BBC with that he believe that this is unfair. 
It is ironic that those institutions in a sensible things during the real estate boom are now called upon some of the costs of those institutions to bear, the far less thorough. 
According to the BSA is not a society since the existence of the recordings in 1945, failed. 
"We are all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks, to see what the alternatives are, at housing societies and their members of potentially major costs to protect." 
The interest due in 2009, will cover the seven months of the end of September this year until the end of March. 
In the year 2010 due interest for a full year and that could be almost twice as much. 
Since Baugesellschaften mutual organisations without the shareholders are to be their members for the cost either by higher taxes or lower interest rates on savings accounts must pay.
