The Superkleber, which goes up to walls can 
The forces of gravity Klebstoffes to defeat thanks to a high and walls to climb as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now seems almost there is reached. 
With a on a surface area of only 2.5 qcm exasperated Kleber is the researchers have succeeded in a 100 kilos senkrechten bodies in an effort to fix. 
The studio – an American magazine has, the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, of the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory (TRL) published. 
The of the team of researchers imaginary material is a further development of the already glues used by a particular carbon structure, called Kohlenstoff-Nanoröhrchen, use. 
"The principle of the Klebers is like a number to a pile of spaghetti tubes set to present," said Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists have from the feet are inspired the Geckos by mikroskopischen Härchen are covered, the animal a perfect halt. 
The with various materials like glass Schleifpapier Teflon and tests have shown that the new Kleber ten times more than the ability to think the feet of the reptiles and, at the same time, "can be easily removed from the wall," Liming Dai, researchers of the college of engineering at the University of Dayton. 
On walls along traveled? "This material could be used as a deciduous glue," Dai Liming is added. 
Just like Spiderman on walls emporzugehen? Perhaps already, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefits, such as the combination of electrical equipment, because the Nanoröhrchen are as head of heat and electricity. 
Other areas of application in the field of space. 
For the moment, the super heroes must still wait. 
The other kind of research, including the University of Berkeley, California, is working on a new Kleberart. 
In an article of the American chemical Society present the Californian scientists a glue from the micro fibers like hair by movement on a surface clean by the dust and always maintain a perfect liability.
