CSU: Mercy on time 
At the end of October will on the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein decided 
Despite the election debacle for heads to roll, not yet, at the top of the Bavarian CSU were postponed the staff debates. 
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein, still remain in office, the question is how long this mercy continues. 
The fate of the Tandems after the disastrous 17-prozentigen Stimmverlust will on the last October weekend at the extraordinary party congress. 
The much gescholtene duo has already but says that it is not on their bellies may name. 
So that they want the angry group and appease the party base, a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" with the loss of the absolute majority demanded personal consequences. 
Five years ago, admittedly, under the leadership of the high point of his career the Edmund Stoiber - reached the Christian Social Union nor 60,7%. But now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes. 
The CSU was 46 years "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria, the 18 per cent of the German GDP. 
The Conservatives remain the dominant force in the for the Hungarian economy important southern federal country in the future, but in a coalition rule. 
The first signal of the Party of internal restructuring is the potential successors Hubers, Vice-President and German Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer in the exploration team involved with the liberal Free Democrats, or the right-wing "Free voters' exploratory talks on a possible Munich coalition. 
It is an irony of fate in the same way that the list "voters Free" Gabriele Pauli ushering in the legislative period, whose Anti-Stoiber appearance Huber-Beckstein duo has exploited the first, then the determined politician abzuservieren mercilessly. 
The CSU-FÃ¼hrung now concentrated all its energies on the stabilisation Becksteins. 
In the transition process will Stoiber, the as the strings from behind the scenes drew, an active role. The former Prime Minister and the 28 September CSU-Vorsitzender called "the most bitter day of his political career." 
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic comments in the direction of CDU, in his opinion, the CSU would have far more support from the sister party deserves. 
Other CSU-Politiker interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel. 
Should the CSU, the 2005 national level has contributed a great deal of success, not with a common effort back on its feet, can Merkel after the Bundestag elections in September 2009 Chancellor will not again. 
Merkel, who from their disappointment at the fiasco has made no secret, believes that the terrain loss of the CSU not detrimental to the grand coalition in Berlin. 
What, however, relatively is: The wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis is to continue, however, the Social Democrats. 
With the SPD 18,6% reached its best result so far in Bavaria since 1946.
