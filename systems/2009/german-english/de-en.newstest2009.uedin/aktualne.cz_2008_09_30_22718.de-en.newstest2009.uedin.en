Questions after the accident, are in the bus Stewards unlawful? 
The law does not know it, in a Fernreisebus is not permitted to run around the 
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of society student Agency in the vicinity of the Italian Padua raises the question of whether Stewards and travellers during the journey, and Daisy back on the bus. 
"We wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, as is the work of a Stewards in breach of the law on the road," the spokesman for the Transportation Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, in the last week, the death of a young Stewardess, was probably caused by the drivers of lorries, the path of the bus kreuzte. 
The young woman sat in this moment, in addition to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although they still had two more seats available. 
A bus will but also in the moment have an accident or slow sharply in which the Steward coffee or newspapers austrägt. 
Also plays a role, whether the bus after the vehicle letter with Stehplätzen. 
If this is not provided for in the bus, the travellers are sitting. 
The long-distance coaches of student Agency have no Stehplätze; what is the director of the firm Radim Jančura, towards Aktuálně.cz confirmed. 
"We have discussed with the ministry, and it has first by the movement of passengers not approved. 
Later this has changed and we have come to a consensus that the passengers during the journey must go to the toilet, if they have their seats, "he shared with his position. 
The law knows no Steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a Stewards - no legislation describes this role. 
However, there is no law that prohibits the carriers, services to provide. 
The law on road transport knows only the concept car companions; its rights and obligations but not defined, "the spokesman of the Ministry Hanzelka is clear. 
The director of the department road vehicles of the Transportation Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law this problem afterwards. 
"It is a question of whether the bus in the product approval Stehplätze has also. 
This is then everything, "he said. 
Buses are divided between city buses, where it Stehplätze and where the speed limit is limited, transport buses with Stehplätzen and a higher permitted speed and distance coaches without Stehplätze with the highest permissible speed and seats that are equipped with safety belts. 
As in the plane, says the professional 
The BESIP-Fachmann for traffic safety Jaroslav Hořín sees in the movement of Stewards on board a bus not essential. 
"With a liquid driving will not threaten many dangers, the situation is comparable with the service on board a plane. 
Here, too, is not sure when turbulence, and the Stewardess can. " 
"Slow, however, a bus, then, of course, also apply the laws of physics. 
Just as in the Stadtbus or in a tram. 
The safety of Stewards must clarify the carrier by internal rules, "says he and also says that this issue from the point of view of the law will not be fully resolved. 
Jančura is prepared, the services to remove 
Student Agency offers the only Busfirma services of Stewards. 
The company employs some 200 people in this role. 
The director does their professional even after the accident, not as risikoträchtig. 
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of Stewards risikoträchtig, I will remove it. 
Coffee and newspapers can the travellers in boarding. 
This would also reduce the costs, "he says. 
As interest in the safety justifying the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin, the absence of Stewards in his buses. Its society but is only a fraction of lines in comparison with student Agency. 
"We have no hostesses, we are reacting against us from the outset. 
Sooner or later it ends with some fatal accident, "he had not quite a year for Týden.cz said. 
It was an incredible tragedy 
The accident involving a bus lines to Naples was a young Stewardess Pilsen draw from the region, the two years for the company had worked. 
The Slovenian lorry was probably without the hard shoulder blinken abgebogen and had blocked the bus journey. 
The driver of the bus tried to sidestep through a penetrating manoeuvres, subsequently collided with the right front, however, with the lorry. 
That the two seats have been sold for the Stewards are Jančura disputes. 
"In these places can not be reserved, they are blocked." 
Drivers firm wants to sue. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman is the agency not on the court judgement a financial damages but it also expected on the part of the blame. 
A change in the law? 
Not in view 
A more detailed regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring a legal system, in which a team of the Transport Ministry dreißigköpfiges experts already working on a year. 
"This is, however, no specific conclusion. 
Buses are not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones in the travel, "expert Hořín. 
"The Department of Transport considers the work of the Stewards not as something that the safety of passengers could threaten substantially," Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of the police and the employment protection authorities.
