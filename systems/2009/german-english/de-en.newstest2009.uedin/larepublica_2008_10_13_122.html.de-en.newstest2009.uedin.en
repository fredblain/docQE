Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the towns close their historic cinemas 
The historic cinema close because of the beneficiary Multiplexkinos. 
"A city with no cinemas is a blind city, as a face with no eyes." 
This image of the film director, Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what now in the large urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces, is happening. 
The process of exclusion of the cinema, with the birth of the large multinational Chamber complex in the periphery, began to mean in the long term Einsaalkino death in the centre. A process that not only seems inevitable and irreversibly, but also a cultural crime. 
Affected mostly historical sites are full of memories, "it is like losing a friend with whom you were a bit of emotion has come down," the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" him 20 years ago the Oskar and the big price of Cannes. It is the story of a Vorstadtkinos and its nostalgia, what is it, in a good for ever lost cinema world. 
The figures, which the Standardisation -, the key industry association provides, speak a clear language: In the last five years have the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinema must close; this bill paid the bulk of the cinema in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
The worst affected regions are part of the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This shows that the main culprits are the Multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions, in which the greatest number of this modern cinemas have been recorded, with 195 in the last 5 years leading the lists of Lombardy, 81 have it both in Tuscany and in the Emilia-Romagna. 
"The business has developed in an irrational way," Paolo Protti, the President of the Standardisation -, "it is useful to have new structures, but to come first, the preservation of already existing, for a room in the city, not all its habitués ready to replace the old one Multiplexkino in the periphery to visit. 
And here is still the lack of budget for the fund of the industry association äußer: The state recorded debt amounts to some EUR 10 million. 
It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral position that the government does not respect the existing laws. 
In order to maintain the sector, would be between 16 and 18 million per year by needs ". 
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which because of the fears about the old cinemas decided that this by an agreement between the community and to protect the Standardisation -; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect the traditional cinema and to support both in the historic centre, and in the periphery. 
Among the measures are also expected tax before divisions for the cinema operators, and the benefits for the audience on the transport: It will be permitted in the verkehrslimitierten areas of the centre and also to travel to lower parking fees to park. 
"It is a welcome initiative," Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and, moreover, still new concepts design. 
But we also need a better Audio- and video equipment, against the superpower of the Multiplexsäle something to do, after all, is the audience of more demanding. 
The defence of the traditional cinema is for me has always been an important issue: The closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the tipping point of me got, the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso" to base, even if I have for 10 years ago with the idea had played. 
For 25 years, I live in Rome; if I on the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale over agree, where I saw so many different emotions, drehe I me to the side, not the staubbedeckten posters to see.
