Free opinion - The Orwellian speaking of Barrick Gold 
In its edition of 17 September Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, the Canadian gold mine Vize-Generaldirektor Barrick Gold. 
This confirms, following a Orwellian logic that the biggest gold collection society in the world for libel over six million against three authors and a small funds sought a publishing house, with the aim of a 'public transparent debate'. 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then judge it on the truth, especially in the case of slander complaints, but above the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference was by Mr Garver completely hidden. 
As for Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, everyone in the ruin of driving who dares to take a of their opposite view to represent. 
No matter how the process is based, the authors and the editor of the book Noir between Canada will spend significant sums to prepare for their defence and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight, the from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine will be paid. 
The tactic in this unequal fighting is also often, the defenders to ruin an amicable settlement in order to force the other side is muzzled and also discourages anyone who dares to take once again to deal with the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have their view of the situation in the face of public opinion must present. 
By contrast, what in many of the countries in which Barrick Gold is working, and is normally in Canada debates through the exchange of ideas and not by Knüppelhiebe fought. 
This could have been enough for gold mine their books and documents disclosed and have a real debate opened by the newspapers, media, publishing and financing of independent Prüfteams, the light on this question would bring. 
But Barrick Gold seems no confidence in public opinion and to have dismissed the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir between Canada with a hand. 
Could Mr Garver explain how he, at the same time, a 'public' debate can ask and yet the views of these public scorn? 
Apparently includes this word in the world of the Vice-President only the generously remunerated lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very nice beengte view of the term. 
In a democracy, the detractors have the right to speak. 
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or not to understand is that the public, the authors and publishers of Noir between Canada supported, this particularly does, because they the brutal attitude of the gold mine is opposed. 
The public is willing, Barrick listen and to judge, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many as Knebel-Klage exercise (in the course of the 'public debate Barrick Gold' has a call to the authors of Noir between Canada, in which she demanded of them, not to use this term...). 
Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, is the complaint of Barrick Gold a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the truth, the essential for any democratic society. 
They completely denied the right to quote credible sources and on facts and interpretations to discuss form the basis of the intellectual work. 
If it in a country such as Canada is impossible, subjects to research and discuss, the rich companies like this world, who else can it do? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead by the scientific standards by the authors of Noir between Canada have been spent. 
It has a right to reply. 
The university environment, to which we belong, White for a long time, debates and inconsistencies in the control and conflicts to be resolved. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what they claim, in no mood to a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the university world, as it was for the public debate, and it is time for the governments to take measures to limit the this type of unfair complaints.
