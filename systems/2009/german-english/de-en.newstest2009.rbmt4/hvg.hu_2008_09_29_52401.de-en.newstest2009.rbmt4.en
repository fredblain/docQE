Do believings less of pain have? 
How newest research results cover, that the belief religious such as a type "analgesic" would cause, that should have eased already death of Catholic martyr. 
Scientists of the Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment: It was examined to what extent the belief influences the Schmerzempfinden of the person at God, reported the British leaf "telegraph". 
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, ever 12 believing and atheists of electro shock received while they studied a painting of the mother of God. 
How the results showed, the believings were able to turn off the large part of the pains. 
By means of a brain Scan technology even could be proved that the Catholics were able to activate the part of its brain, that is responsible for the pain regulation. 
The investigation was that not until a research project at which next to scientists also philosophers and theologians of different departments of the university participate. 
In the attempt, a twinkling device was tied up the test subject at the left hand, which delivered the electro shock. 
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two paintings: To the one a picture of the mother of God, painted of Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other Leonardo there Vincis "lady with the ermine". 
The researchers hoped that the view of the virgin Maria would evoke under the believing trances religious a type, while they selected there Vincis picture, because it differed hardly by the other painting and was perceived as calming. 
The test subjects of spent a half hour apiece in a MRI scanner, and received look at should in this time of altogether 20 electro shock in four stages, during it either the religious, or the other painting. 
The Catholics reported, they would have felt in the view of the mother of God "in security" as if they would be "umsorgt", and they would have perceived "quiet and peace". 
During the observing of the religious painting, they reported over 12% less of pain as if they had Leonardos work before eyes. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias that participated also in the attempt meant, one could evoke similar effects also with other, strongly causing pictures also at the atheists, one would have to find merely the corresponding photo. 
"We must a picture find, that very positive perceptions releases, like about a mother or a father", so the psychologist. 
The anglikanische bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
"The practiceing of the Glaubens should our personality change, and does it also in many cases", so Wright. 
After these outstanding results, the question remains only which effect a madonna picture would have Leonardos or another comparable painter on the pain regulation of the believing. 
Would the qualitatively high-value virgin Maria obtain even better results?
