Mónica Cruz is graceful, but full joie de vivre. 
Currently the siblings Gruz take its new activity in the fashion very seriously. 
For Mónica, that means substantially more, than for some pretty and rich girls, who preserve its call. 
It was in Paris in the graduation of the firm mango, transfers there its residence and moreover the presentation of the most important premiums in the fashion that sponsors the Spanish fashion house makes. 
Mercifully and shy, winner on the short stretches.

Since that I was small, I was enthused of the clothing; I wanted to go always to my grandmother, would select around around in the Kleidungsschränken of my aunt and to see its clothing. 
That was super to go nearly better than into a leisure time park. 
Already later, than a dancer, tried I to pay attention always to the garment. 
You know like yes, we dancers it so very to have our own style in instruction and in the samples, in order to view into the mirror and to feel us at the same time well.

Did before a couple of days you appear on the course path with Naomi Campbell, agree that? 
Is yes good, won so what not. 
It is not so that I went on the course path in order to model. 
Naomi Campbell that I have known for some time, simply called me and invited to London to participate around in a parade for the charity organization of its organization `Frauen for a better world' and the clothing that we show. I know that two garments became auctions out of our collection for mango in order to gather the money for Naomis NGO.

In order to support the women in the Third World, what is also necessary.
