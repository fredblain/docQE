USA. The financial breakdown leaves behind its traces also with journalists: In the newspapers, one can sense already the abridgments. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press. 
Five hundred American journalists became the future of the PEW Research center over its situation and its mental inspection concerning questioned. 
Today almost all journalists are pessimistically what concerns its future. 
Nevertheless they explained not really provides the information concerning responsible vis-à-vis that because of the general credibility. 
They do not feel so alone like earlier. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that was destroyed. 
Thereto the large problems come through the abridgments appropriate the Newsroom, therefore the room in which the editors work in order to assemble the newspaper. 
It does not act solved will must around a problem, that – so the interviewed journalists – if one wants to prevent, that the journalism traditional understands, how the large public it, substantially shrinks itself. 
A clear, but complicated pessimism fulfills today the American journalist. 
Six of ten journalists and Executive of senior of the printing press are of the opinion that the journalism would be on national levels on the incorrect way. 
In the local area are it in the Executives even at that 65%. 
Printed vs. Broadcast. 
It is not difficult for the journalists to imagine, in which direction the Web goes. 
The most important publishing groups clear themselves the way into the Internet, that is looked at by many as the "killer" of the printing press. 
That "economical pressure" that the journalists sense, climbed around up to 79%. 
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted would bring to want to join the new technology, in the hope "it something goods for the journalism". 
The largest tear exists in the American journalism today between the editors in chief of the newsroom and the reporter, who work for it. 
56% the editors in chief on national levels are certain, its reporters divide its values with them, while it on more locally plain solely 23% are. 
Some think, it has to do with the "security in the work". 
To lose the business leaders who have anxiety, its work within three years, 47% amount to plain on more nationally. 
At the journalists, 30 are it%. 
The subject of the "certain work" in the team (our "editors", Anm d. speech). a current subject is in the USA always. 
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. 
In a gigantic nation how it are the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, periodicals, radio operators and TV transmitters and Internet operators, offer chooses the employers such as it them and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it. 
The editors in chief get can get very often very high wages, the editor on the other hand sometimes only 10000 Euro per month, in addition pension moneys and insurance moneys. 
What concerns the vacation, is complicated the thing: a certain quantity at days in the first year, so and so many after the third in order to reach in the end vacation days after a certain number of years 15. 
But the American journalists become how it itself admit, in the course of the year frequently "suffer". 
It is a question of the climate.
