Olmert would return almost all occupied zones in the exchange for peace 
The chairperson of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert expressed himself for the return practically all zones, that were occupied 1967, therefore also the Jordanland, east Jerusalem and the Golan heights if one could close peace with Palestine and Syria in the exchange for that. 
It emphasized this in an interview, that was printed on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot. 
"We must to an agreement with the Palestinians arrive, what means, that it necessary becomes, almost all (occupied) zones to return, if not quite all", said Olmert vis-Ã -vis the newspaper. 
"We retain a conscience percentage of these zones, but we become at the Palestinian a similarly high percentage (Israeli zone) lecture must, because it without this no peace give becomes", joined it thereto. 
It cleared that a possible return also east Jerusalem would comprise. 
"That, that security in Jerusalem wants and above all does not want, that tractors or bulldozer over its legs roll, how it one of my best friends happens is, becomes on a part of Jerusalem forgo must", Olmert noted in allusion two attacks in the city in July, with which several persons were killed and dozens of persons were injured. 
After words of the premier, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple Bern and holy and historic places", that lie on the territory of the old town. 
"That, that uprightly wants to receive the Israeli sovereignty over the total city, will have to integrate 270,000 Arabians. 
That will not function", strengthened it further. 
Deduction of the Golan heights 
Olmert expressed itself for a deduction of Israel of the Golan heights, what in its opinion an indispensable condition is for the conclusion of a peace contract with Syria. 
This would require however also certain exertions on sides of Damascus. 
"My suggestion reads not, with Syria only and alone on the basis of a deduction of the Golan heights peace to close", strengthened Olmert. 
"The Syrier know only all too well whereon they must renounce in order to recover the Golan heights. 
They will have to forgo its present relation to the Iran; they will have to forgo its relation to the (Shiite) Hisbollah movement; they will have to forgo the permanent support, grant that it the terrorism of that (Shiite) Hamas movement, that terror network al Khaida and the jihad (the holy war) in Iraq", concretized the prime minister.
