A name for the s√ºndteure child 
Now the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar 700-Mrd-Dollar 700-Mrd-Dollar 700-Mrd-Dollar DOLLAR of heavy rescue package law exists, that becomes to use be in several stages and aims on the purchase of the bad credit of the banks. 
In the first run, the half of the money is supposed to be issued. 
In a session, that went on Saturday after midnight local time east coast to end, the congresswomen brought themselves after multi-day debates to a unification over the rescue package heavy 700-Milliarden-Dollar 700-Milliarden-Dollar billions 700-Milliarden-Dollar DOLLAR, reported Reuters. 
"We have essential progress obtains", said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the American house of representatives, and meant, had to put one the unification only on paper. 
Both presidency candidates supported the obtained compromise over the rescue package - Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Treasury Minister Henry Paulson meant to the result: The program will show effect and becomes it efficient, one had to do however yet more. According to Pelosi, it would not concern tearing around here the rescue of the Wall Street, but rather therefore, the oar of the economy. 
The written frame of the package became before the opening of the Asian markets, therefore, Washington time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European Time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), publishes, released however no height flight on the stock exchanges. 
On Monday first the house of representatives will vote over the bill to the stabilization of the economy of 2008, is the senate at the row. 
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday evening with Pelosi, and also the white house welcomed the messages over the unification. 
We are satisfied with the progress obtained in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the white house. 
The program deviates to be sure from the original recommendation of the Bush administration according to what the 700 billions of dollar should be issued all at once for the purchase more rotten, with credit of burdened securities. 
In a first tranche, the half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages 700-Milliarden-Betrages billion 700-Milliarden-Betrages of fraud is supposed to be issued maximally whereby 250 billions are immediately available, after the congress will vote as expected on Monday over the Causa. This sum is supposed to be spent for the purchase of credit onerous, bad securities, and over the further 100 billion USD, the president should decide. 
The program is reviewed of an own commission, that also the president of the Federal reserve listened to. 
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of the congress. 
In the sense of the law, the treasury can use also a combined tactic: It can burdened purchase simultaneously bad credit, mortgages, and with mortgages securities, or also other "poisonous" credit. 
How responsible persons of the ministry reported, the purchase can both in an auction and direct result. 
The law enables pay it the concerned firms to participate in an insurance program, with which the treasury guarantees the serious means, and the businesses the fees corresponding to expecting damages. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defined the necessary means so that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as an immediately aid for the American financial system, would be it for the large-scale purchase of bad means, its insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk that is released by the collapse of a larger money institute. 
We set the necessary steps so that we are ready to the introduction of the law, as soon as it was signed, so Paulson. 
The bosses of that in difficulties of advised and now on national aid directed banks can calculate to be sure therewith that its dispatches, that are named in the overseas slang careless "gold-like handshake", of which government are shortened. 
There will be an abridgment of the salaries only in certain cases, and these abridgments will depend therefrom how the treasury assists respectively. 
The abridgment meant essentially that if the ministry purchases in the frame of an auction, so that "gold-like handshake" taxed becomes, unless, the from served bank boss is pushed off into the pension. 
In the case a direct purchase of that, credit go bad aggressively will turn on itself the government in order to guarantee that the manager salaries are not exaggerated. 
To the picture is appropriate also that the existing are not changed gold-like handshake contracts - the restrictions relate only on new agreements so that the more persons participate in the program. 
That is the first case in the American story that abridgments are regulated in manager salaries per law, commented on the democrat Barney Frank, chairperson of the finance committee, the measure. 
The country wins participation rights at the interested banks so that the risk sinks for the taxpayers, because they can take part also, as soon as it again better goes the economy and therewith also the rescued bank. 
The bill plans that the president must submit the congress in the next five years a suggestion, how the taxpayers should recover its lost money out of the finance sector again. 
There was to be sure on both sides skeptic who expressed its doubts with regard to the plan. 
That is not that, what the American citizens of us expect, the plan protects the money of the taxpayer in no case, so the Californian republican Darrell Issa. 
Its colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur meant: The measures were pushed of the same persons, who are responsible also for the collapse of the Wall Street.
