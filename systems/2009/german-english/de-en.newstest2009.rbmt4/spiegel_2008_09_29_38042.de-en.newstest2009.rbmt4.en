Praise for flight tickets and hotels sink 
In the first half of the year 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the preceding year. 
In Germany, flights became loud a current study even up to 50 percent cheaper. 
If flew and again more favorably became overnight stays in hotels - that is the result of a study of the trip service provider and finance service provider American express. 
The business analyzed its entry data out of the first half year 2008 and assessed a clear break-in in the second quarter after an increasing of the prices in the first quarter. 
After the prices climbed on the hotel market for years, the overnight stays in many places already reduced in price themselves. 
From January to March, the prices in 41 of 48 climbed examined European cities yet around on the average 6.9 percent in comparison with 2007. 
From April to June, the prices were however already around 3.6 percent lower than in the preceding year. 
Most clearly the trend in Paris and Rome had been where travelers before pay must 30 to 37 percent fewer than a year. 
As a cause for that American express sees the weak dollar rate that had led to a "decreasing wanderlust of American tourist". 
Also finance places such as Frankfurt or London would be concerned more strongly of the decline of the hotel prices than locations of industry such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices with a climb of 26.3 percent hold even the record in Europe. 
Also in the Flugpreisen, the trend in the first quarter showed yet towards the top: 
Because of the kerosene increase, travelers in the Economy class had to pay became on average 7.1 percent more than 2007, fuel intensive long-range flights even up to 29.2 percent more expensive. 
From April to June, the prices sank were for flight tickets of the Economy class around on the average 12.5 percent in comparison with the preceding quarter, in the business that and First Class the price variations however by far slighter. 
In Germany, the prices broke yet more strongly a than in other European countries: 
From January to March, the prices had climbed around 11.9 percent, sank in the second quarter it around 23.6 percent. 
In German domestic flights the prices even halved themselves according to the study. 
Let reason for the price break-in be on the one hand the diminishing economic growth, explains the business. 
The demand in many segments of the flight trip market crumbles. 
On the other hand there are through that opuses-ski-come off, that liberalizes the air traffic between the USA and Europe, an increased competition pressure. 
Let sign of the tense situation be the deletions unprofitabler stretches in airline, as well as the high number of the airline, that in the first half year 2008 bankruptcy registered would have - alone in Europe were this 24 airlines.
