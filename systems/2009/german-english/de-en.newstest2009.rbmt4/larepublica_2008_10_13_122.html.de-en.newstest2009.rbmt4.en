Goodbye to the old movie theater Paradiso – its historic movie theater halls close the cities 
The historic movie theaters close based on the favored Multiplexkinos. 
"A city without movie theater halls is a blind city, like a face without Augen." 
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect, what happens momentarily in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces. 
The process of the exclusion of the movie theaters, that began with the birth of the large Multisaalkomplexe in the periphery, means in the long run death for the on hall movie theater in the center. A process that appears not only inevitably and irrevocably, but rather also the trains of a cultural crime carries. 
Concerned are usually historic places full memories, "it is like a friend to lose, with the emotions full one a piece street traversed has", so the director the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" that brought in it 20 years ago the Oskar and the large price of Cannes. It concerns the story of a suburb movie theater and its nostalgia, which exists from that to live in one probably for always lost movie theater worlds. 
The numbers, which the Anec, that central business association delivers, speak one clearly language: in the last five years had to close paid the enormous quantity of 316 traditional movie theater; this mine to a large degree the movie theaters in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
To the most strongly concerned regions, the Emilia Romagna with 82 lost movie theater belong, followed of the Tuscany with 44 and the Lombardei with 41. 
This witnesses therefrom that the head indebted are the Multiplexkinos, for are straight these three regions, in which the largest number of these modern movie theaters was registered: with 195 in the last 5 years leads the Lombardei the lists on, it are 81 both in the Tuscany and in the Emilia Romagna. 
"The business has itself in an irrational manner developed", so Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "it is to be sure usefully that also new structures arise, but at first place stands the receipt of the already existing, for closes a hall in the city, are not all its patrons ready to search for in place of the old a Multiplexkino in the periphery. 
And here yet the missing budget respect remains external for the foundation the business association: the indebtedness indicated by the country amounts to ca. 10 million Euro. 
It is a shame of the ethically moral standpoint that the government does not note the existing laws. 
In order to received the sector, would be between 16 and 18 million Euro in the year of needs". 
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which concluded based on the anxieties around the old movie theater halls, is, to protect this through an agreement between the community and the Anec; it concerns the first agreement of this type in Italy, that aims on that to protect and to support the traditional movie theaters, and this both in the historic center and in the periphery. 
Under the anticipated measures, also fiscal before divisions are for the movie theater operators as well as advantages for the public regarding the local traffic: it will be permitted, to go into the verkehrslimitierten areas of the center and to park moreover to more favorable parking fee. 
"It is a pleasant initiative", so Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join to our example and sketch in addition also yet new drafts. 
Certainly however we require also a better Audio- and video equipment in order to be able to align against the superpower of the Multiplexsäle something, for in the end the public of today is more demanding. 
The defense of the traditional movie theater was for me always an important subject: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, that place of my childhood and youth to establish, was the decisive point, that brought me in addition the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", also if I had played already for 10 years with the thought. 
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; if I pass at the Rialto or at the Quirinale in that via Nazionale, there where I experienced so many different emotions, turn I me to the side in order to not to have to see the dust overcast placards.
