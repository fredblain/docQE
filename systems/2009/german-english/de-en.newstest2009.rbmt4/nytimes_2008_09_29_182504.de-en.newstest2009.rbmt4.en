Rested Gebrselassie strikes its world record 
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia showed again why it many a consider to be the best long-range runner of all times, after he broke in the Berliner marathon on Sunday its own record and to the first person become is, who created the stretch of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes. 
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved its prior results of 2:04:26 around 27 seconds, that it had reached last year in Berlin. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has sets up therewith its 26th world record in its multilateral career, in which it reached at least a world championship title on every stretch from a kilometer to the marathon or set up a world record. 
Gebrselassie left out last month the Olympic marathon in Beijing, out of anxiety, that was exaggerated afterwards perhaps, that the air soiling could aggravate its asthma problems. 
Instead he registered for the contest in Berlin. 
In almost ideal conditions - in sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees on target -, Gebrselassie with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds won per mile. 
Since train runner such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat changed from Kenya on long-range, the record time is fell for marathon in the last 10 years around more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo won there Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05. 
After its victory on Sunday Gebrselassie of the press announced, would have had it two weeks ago cramps in its calf and was not able to train therefore a week. 
Obviously it is refreshed after recess and returned not on rusted. 
"I am so happy", said it to reporter. 
"Everything perfectly ran. 
I received the training a week ago again and had today a few more objection, but at the end what all super." 
It became for that criticizes - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia rival out of east Africa - that it excessively orchestrates its race courses, many world best marathon stars generally avoids, itself too very on the race leaders leaves as if that would be a train race, and places world records over the contest. 
Yet this criticism damages the size Gebrselassies as a long-range runner hardly. 
Accompanied of four Kenyans on Sunday Gebrselassie had reached the midpoint of the stretch in 1:02:04. 
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi Gebrselassie have demands further after the speed makers had diminished. 
Gebrselassie made something more than three miles before the Finish its last start in order to separate itself from Kwambai, that arrived as second in 2:05:36 and improved therewith its best time around almost 5 minutes. 
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48. 
With women has Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, a notable year locked, in that she showed the seventh fastest result of all times with 2:19:19. 
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain. 
In the last spring, marathon in 2:24:14 had won the 36 years Mikitenko old surprisingly the Londoner. 
It missed the games in Beijing, because of problems, that became as a back injury of described. However she recovered in order to win in Berlin and to improve its best time in its third marathon around five minutes. 
It planned its course adept in that it let first pull out a quartet out of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners, but overtook after 30 kilometers. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2:21:31 while Helena Kiprop arrived from Kenya as third in 2:25:01.
