`Ich receives the master behind the stage to hold around its character', Günter brewer, photographer. 
No paragraphs, no frill, no costumes for the entrance. 
Nature of the large Flamencotänzer, that forgo the concentration and dedicate itself the interpretation, in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man. 
On the one hand artist 
On the other hand personality 
I look in in private life, into these moments, that are strange for the public, I know when I will not enter for the personality typical gesture, that depth of a stolen view or expression strength of the hands, that are provided, because it the stage, find can. 
In its project `Flamenco people' the German photographer Günter farmer abwechselungsreiche Theatralik of some productions represents on the stage with singer, dancer and guitarist. Of this side, it was for the artists yet little well known. 
With this suggestion, the photographer a special Ikonografie of the Flamencodarstellung creates on different plains. 
The display, that belongs to the program of the month of photography the Flamenco, `spiegelt the international importance of Flamenco, that becomes more and more of the day to day larger, against', the artist explains and makes clearly that `Flamenco people can be' `jeder any person, but if one looks at the photos, the spectator notices that it are no typical pictures of artist on the stage. 
Entirely normal persons on the portraits are are to be mediated artist, who in a position on the stage passion, sadness, joy and to move therewith the public. 
In order to be able to hold the personality of this artist, must make one no photos on the stage. 
Your personality and its character is in its hearts. 
To create what interested was me, a personal atmosphere, that would enable me to hold with the photo camera the characters of the largest Flamencomeister'. 
Farmer, inspired of the festival `Cante de Minas read', made itself in 1997 on a long trip in order to photograph singer, Gitaristen or dancer with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the picture sorting function of the camera and the available material, pictures that remind one of classic photography emerged. 
The use of different stylistic means destroys the classic base of the picture by what means the picture the modernity and the idea, how the farmer Flamenco understands, lent become: `Musik with traditional roots that changes and every day surprises'. 
Those are not only the dance, the song or the instrumental game at itself, but rather the personality of the artist, be character, that with its art the public tempts. 
That search for the essential, after a certain something, which becomes in form of the hearing, the his visible, is and was the firm goal of this work, that is presented in the near future in the gallery of the els Fotómata. 
Well known personalities in Flamenco under them Diego el Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, el Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the narrow selection of the almost seventy artist, that were photographed. 
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will become soon as a book, with all portraits out of the display, appear. 
Bauers passion to the portraits led it in addition to take up this idea two years ago yet once and to realize as a `Porträts of the veteran of the sport' (`SportARTproject'). 
Although the drafts of the project `Flamenco people are different', the photographer to `es gives pleases me very to photograph the people, to learn know it and to transfer me into its life condition, would be it for a short moment or a longer time. 
I think that in the area of photography the portrait is the most difficult species. 
You meet or bump into persons, personalities, whom you do not know sometimes at all, or they let you for a couple of minutes alone in order to be able to make a photo. 
Apart from these circumstances, when photographer I try to realize always my ideas.' 
The collection of the portraits of the Flamencos of today with the title `Flamenco people' Fotómata is issued in the gallery of the el, that is in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and passes parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can see the display to the 16th of October.
