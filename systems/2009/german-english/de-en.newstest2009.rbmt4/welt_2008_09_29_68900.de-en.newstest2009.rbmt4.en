Dark matter influences flight of space probes 
For years a mysterious phenomenon has provided in investigation for helplessness: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so named Swing-by-maneuver. 
Experts fear that the general relativity theory Albert could be not entirely correct Einsteins. 
The space probe "Ulysses" flew almost 18 years through the space. 
Because of soon freezing fuel directions threatens its now cold death. 
Under scientists has provided for years a mysterious phenomenon for confusion - the Swing-by-anomaly. 
The Swing by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they receive additional momentum in the gravitation field of a celestial body, about the earth. 
Through it the probes much fuel can save. 
The European American research probe Cassini Huygens used this physical trick just as as the sun probe Ulysses. 
What the researchers at the same time to be sure already since years amazed: The missiles do not behave 100-percent so how one would expect it after the venerable gravitation law. 
Rather it comes to irregularity in the speed. 
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower. 
Until now the physicists were not able to explain this effect. 
They baptized it Swing-by-anomaly. 
Some experts fear that possibly even the general relativity theory Albert could not be entirely correct Einsteins, whom the attractive force of matter describes through a curve of the room. 
The American physicist Stephen eagle of the institute for Advanced Study out of Princeton believes as always firmly that Einstein did not err, and to explain tried the Swing-by-anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter, that settled astronomer in the universe. 
"Responsible for the anomaly could dark matter be, that itself also entirely in the vicinity of the earth find could", writes it. 
Of the existence of the dark matter, the space researchers know for approximately ten years. 
Of it, an attractive force goes out obviously, whose effect can be observed on other celestial bodies. 
You yourself are on the other hand totally invisibly, that is, it sends and reflected no electromagnetic radiation, especially just also no visible light. 
After the calculations of the scientist, the dark matter settles nevertheless well one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
