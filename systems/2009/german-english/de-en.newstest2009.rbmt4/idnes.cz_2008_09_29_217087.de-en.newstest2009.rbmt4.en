The first virtual supplier comes already this year to the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic quite is matured, the Czech suppliers offer practically all services on how they are offered also by its partners in Western Europe. 
Nevertheless something is missing here - a virtual supplier that forces the classic to lower praising. 
Perhaps this will wait let no longer long for itself. 
That the Czech mobile phone suppliers to the most expensive in Europe work generally, about that we have already often on mobile. cz reported. 
This also the telecommunication authority confirmed made by the way that aware that the price is higher for a SMS here than in the remainder of the European Union. 
After the last steps of the European commission in the area regulation of the roaming fees it comes so probably to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone suppliers will be SMS out of foreign countries cheaper than at home. 
How does it come compare to are so high, that the prices in the Czech Republic in that Europe? 
The answer is simple, it is missing the competition that makes really a declaration of war. 
Perhaps sounds it paradoxically, gives in the Czech Republic it yet three mobile phone networks and a penetration of far more than 100%. 
The mobile phone suppliers scold on the other hand gladly about the fact that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market. 
The pflichtet often also the chairperson of the advice of the Czech telecommunication authority Pavel by, that often had expressed in the past, that there would be no place in the Czech Republic for a further supplier. 
It agrees probably that a classic supplier with an own network has no longer particularly many chances (by the way would become it probably also hardly yet frequencies find). 
There is however another possibility - a virtual supplier. 
Just the entrance of virtual supplier on the mobile phone market entailed a clear mark-down on which then also the classic mobile phone suppliers had to react. 
At the same time there was mobile or Virgin mobile before the entrance of such firms such as Tesco on the market in Great Britain similar voices such as in the Czech Republic. 
It appeared however that there is for such suppliers place and that these can be really successful. 
By the way one needs to not to search long for examples. 
We reported in February this over the start of the virtual supplier mobile King in Poland. 
In only a year of half it succeeded this supplier to win more than 100 thousands of customer and to climb so to the five largest supplier of the country. 
Behind mobile King, the finance group Penta, that in the Czech Republic stands at the same time among other things U: fon possesses. 
The advantage of virtual supplier exists at the same time therein that one can concentrate on a much more concrete target group. 
In order to be able to function effectively, need virtual suppliers namely much of less customer than a classic supplier. 
They need namely no relatively high costs for the building, the business and the support of a mobile network. 
In the world, so the virtual suppliers profiare themselves normally as a Low-Cost-firms out - it offer cheap telephone conversations and SMS what is accompanied to be sure often by a less extensive service offer. 
So Tesco mobile in Great Britain SMS offers for example cheaper at least around the half at than its competitors. 
How however the example of mobile King in Poland shows, it can be also a right good gambit to set on a not cliché-ridden target group. 
This supplier directs itself namely specifically to men. 
"Real fellows select mobile King - the supplier, that them pleases and that it trust can", so David Seibert, the CEO of the Entertainment company mobile, the operator firm of this virtual supplier. 
Heavily to say whether a similar draft could get a such as in Poland also in the Czech Republic foothold. 
On that doubts also the press officer of Vodafone Miroslav. "The Czech market is for a market segment, on which most virtual suppliers are based, relatively small. 
Moreover it is from the viewpoint the service offer relative gesättigt." 
In the Czech Republic hopeless, mean the mobile phone suppliers 
It is not certain however almost that, if a virtual mobile phone supplier the Czech Republic conquers, this mobile King be becomes. 
"We do not dissuade see to be sure of an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations particularly hopeful. 
It will come sooner to a market entrance of mobile King in other countries of our region", says in a telephone conversation for mobile. cz Jana press officer of the finance group Penta. 
Indirectly it confirmed so that the present mobile phone suppliers in the Czech Republic are not inclined particularly to this thought. 
In the opposite, they try to do all for that that no potential competitor emerges. 
Your interest in a start of a virtual mobile phone supplier shows already for some time time the group GTS Novera that would like to undertake a further step in order to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area of firm customer. 
"We have a large interest on that to offer our customer not only cable network, but rather also Mobilfunk-Telekommunikationsdienstleistungen. 
And the earlier, the better. 
Over this possibility, we negotiated repeatedly with all Czech mobile phone suppliers. 
With some of them, we were able to reach already negotiation progress", so the press officer of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps now better times come. 
Out of not official information follows that the first virtual supplier is to be expected perhaps until end of the year. 
Until now however this is surrounded of an unüberwindbaren wall of the being quiet. 
"In this moment we do not assume that in the Czech Republic place exists for a full virtual supplier. 
The Czech market shows large specific characteristics vis-à-vis other markets. 
Until now addressed us yet no subject with a complex and serious project in this area", means in its explanation for mobile. cz Vlastimil out of the press department of Telefónica O2. 
On the Spezifik of the Czech market, also further suppliers refer. 
The press officer of T mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the explanation of O2: "Until now we found yet no viable and two-sided advantageous project, construct one on that further könnte." 
And it adds: "In the network of T mobile hardly a virtual supplier will emerge until end of the year. 
In this moment, we would have to exist have already a concrete offer to be able to think around so short-termed." 
Vodafone arranges its attention sooner on the fulfillment of the requests of the own 3G-Lizenz. 
Miroslav means in addition: "For negotiations with potential virtual suppliers we are open, especially in the area division of costs and infrastructure. 
We regard just this from the viewpoint the customers as the best. 
The head strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to the construction of a divided network for an Internet fast mobile." 
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand 
The action of the mobile phone supplier is to be understood easily, a further supplier would be named more competition, this would become sinking praising and through it also to a decline of the profits lead. 
Why should therefore one ease the market entrance for such a competitor? 
That the suppliers can pull at a cord, if it concerns somewhat, covers also the long back and forth around the origin of U: fon. 
The probably strongest pressure toward came at present when U came: fon on the market, from the company T mobile. 
Also the publicly accessible information of that covers that. 
Now however just U suits itself: fon as an argument why one should not allow a virtual supplier. 
Martina Kemrová noted in addition: "The competition background of the mobile phone market was strengthened recently moreover yet through the market entrance of a fourth mobile phone supplier. 
Under consideration of the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech republic is place obvious, that a new participant requests high at the market even and above all its services würde." 
In view of this Herangehensweise of the mobile phone supplier, the absolute the interest of the Czech regulating authorities amazes to be sure. 
It does not concern has at the same time not only the bearing of that that in Czech unfortunately - in the difference to Great Britain and further highly developed countries - the competence to interfere into the economic competition. 
This possesses excluding the office to the protection of the economic competition (ÚOHS). 
This however related its entirely typical bearing to this total problematic nature. 
"The market entrance of a virtual mobile phone supplier would be then possible after it came to a contract conclusion between a mobile phone supplier and a virtual supplier over the Anmietung of the necessary infrastructure. 
Until now was locked was no such contract, for the offer of potential interested parties probable for the classic suppliers not sufficiently interesting", so in its answer on our inquiry Kristián Chalupa of the department outside relations of the ÚOHS. 
Of representatives of the supplier, such a formulation would not surprise. 
Of an authority, that represent the consumer interests and should among other things on that eighth, that no one abuses its position on the market, is this more than doubtful. 
Especially, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual suppliers work very normally, is to be observed, contributed that its market entrance to a mark-down in mobile telephone services hat." 
Probably however the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a mark-down do not belong to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
Really shocking the almost already moving harmony of the three mobile phone supplier that results from its reactions is at this case. 
The question whether it concerns really only a chance, lies on the hand. 
Just as the absolute same gasoline price is certain in the gas station only chance and the consequence of a hard competition. 
"The authority no sign at all discovered in this thing, that point out an actions arranged against the competition, and therefore it has also no reason to interfere on any type into the matter. 
None of the supplier has a dominant market position, therefore it has not also the corresponding increased responsibility for its actions on the market. 
The necessary instruments for an opening of the mobile phone market for virtual suppliers are missing probably also the regulating authority for telecommunication", led Chalupa in its explanation on. 
The interpretation of the dominating position on the market is one of many debatable points. 
Naturally there is is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared of that after the telecommunication from the viewpoint the economic competition a single market. 
On such a market, none of the Czech mobile phone suppliers possesses then naturally a dominating position. 
Some right experts however offer another visibility manner - for the market entrance of a virtual supplier is always the approval of the network operator necessary. 
And the mobile phone suppliers has - logical would prove - the monopoly for its network. 
That means that it takes in a dominating position in a certain segment of necessity. 
Even if one does not go along however with this argumentation, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three mobile phone suppliers incidentally similarly advance. 
At the same time troubles of a row of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) cover that they bump in negotiations with all suppliers into very similar hindrances. 
The Abwälzung of the responsibility on that is then in the telecommunication services a quite usual trick with which the ÚOHS of the entire matter dissociates itself. 
This was to be observed already in some similar cases. 
Unfortunately it is not arrive to put through in the novel dismissed recently of the telecommunication law the expansion of the competences the on the area of the economic competition in the telecommunication although a row by specialists had promised itself therefrom an improvement of the situation. 
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know that only all too well, but they probably have other interests. 
It goes already if no one views there 
Unnoticed the functioning of any pseudovirtueller supplier, of which it gives several in the Czech mobile phone networks immediately, remains first once. 
Firms, that issue own prices lists for mobile telecommunication services, are, that are only partly public however. 
Normally it concerns namely firms, that act in the area Multilevel marketing. 
Own mobile telephone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia telecom, Starlife and other. 
The prices lists of these firms arrive normally only at selected. 
The joke of the thing exists therein that the firm appears vis-à-vis the operator as a classic firm customer, who orders a large quantity at SIM cards. 
As an important customer, he receives then special quotations (and other offers). 
The problem exists therein that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone suppliers forbid a similarly natured resale. 
"Should it cases give, that you describe, can it itself around an injury of the contractual conditions act, with which we us then busy become, what a termination of the collaboration with the corresponding company lead can", answered Martina Kemrová on our question to this problem. 
It is to be sure quite unlikely that so something does not get around in the responsible of the mobile phone supplier. 
Especially in the case of the three mentioned firms, it can concern thousands of customer. 
No operator opposes however such an action. 
Out of the activity of these firms, profits to be neglected do not flow in them namely, simultaneously are impaired it - in the difference to the actual virtual suppliers - not through the actual official marketing. 
On possible problems, Miroslav makes attentively: "The law enabled be used such types of speculations, in spite of everything the services of these firms only of a very slight percentage of the customers. 
These must accept in addition that the SIM card in its telephone does not run on its name, they can order therefore not full about that like the normal customers of the mobile phone supplier." 
Already alone that however at least strangely would have to occur that. 
Moreover a further question opens itself for the ÚOHS. 
The lock mobile phone suppliers block themselves before such an action the eyes, why it against a virtual supplier? 
It is to be added that the ÚOHS has to the disclosure of such activities quite strong competences, and if it does not want, it must not itself with the explanation of the supplier, they would know nothing therefrom and its business conditions would become this forbid, satisfied give. 
When the Czech Republic is no longer most expensively 
How in the text already repeatedly emphasized became, the market entrance of virtual supplier entailed a clear price decline in the different services. 
At the same time have practically in all countries where virtual suppliers emerged, that tries classic supplier, whose origin practically more or few to prevent. 
That of them used were arguments practically identical - a to smaller, and/or to very satiated market, problem in the quality of the services etc. 
In the advanced countries however the regulation organs interfered just in these moments, that tried to preserve in no way the interests of the mobile phone supplier, but rather that of its customers. 
If let it be not through formal measures or formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator emerged, and this followed further. 
Unfortunately the Czech regulation organs throw themselves the entire case to like a hot potato. 
Do not come from our experiences we can eliminate ourselves the impression that vagueness in the competences in these cases is favorable more than. 
Yet we do not throw the gun into the grain. 
If the background information agrees and soon a virtual supplier will emerge, the Czech mobile phone market will set itself perhaps soon again in motion. 
If a supplier allows the origin of a virtual mobile phone supplier, the ÚOHS will not remain idle if it goes therefore to reject (to discriminate) further interested parties. 
And the Czechs more expensively will telephone then finally no longer than the remainder of Europe.
