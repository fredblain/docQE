Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee 
What would the best method to the development of new technologies to the accident avoidance be if the hindrances sensors to not to imitate out of nature? 
For example that of the bees. 
In the CEATEC in Japan, an astonishing project was introduced, with which the Nissan engineers were inspired accident of new by bumblebee in the Erschaffung avoiding systems. 
In collaboration with the Tokioter university, Nissan constructed the biomimetische system driven by car robots of the type BR23C, a mini car, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with which goal to support, the development of a system, that avoids each collision. 
In the flight forms each bee its own, oval "private area", that is very similar our own "protection to sign", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, in the display. 
The put together eye of the bee, that can see into each direction and in an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays at the same time an important role. 
In order to imitate the function of the put together eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser driven distance knife. 
This identifies hindrances before the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates its distances and sends signals at the microprocessor at Board, that initiates immediately the kollisionsvermeidenden process. 
The hindrance is registered in fractions of a second, and the car robot changes immediately the course, similarly the movement of the bees in that it turns the tires around the corresponding angle. 
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively. 
"If it not so would be, could the car robot not quickly enough react, around the hindrances to avoid", explained Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the car robot project. 
The system must instinctively and immediately react, corresponds there this technology to the most internal and most vulnerable part of the protection sign - a layer within which accidents count presently yet as unavoidable. 
The total process must reflect the behavior of the bees if they avoid other bees. 
And that must expire in the fraction of a second. 
To be sure the avoiding not quite diagonally can result, in contrast to the bees, up, down, or - it can be only two-dimensional, and to be sure only toward the turning point bar-ness of the tire. 
While the bees here endlessly many possibilities openly stand, in order to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to make use of at the car robot of only the rotation, or the accelerating and braking. 
The BR23C contains have lithium polymer batteries that are easier and energy more efficient, and therefore a longer service life, than a conventional lithium ion batteries. 
Andoh explained, it comes on the instinctive, intelligent reaction on, and fewer on the processing of the data, and yet fewer on the capacity to store this. 
This device must process some input per second solely and must react correspondingly to it. 
It doesn't have to store produce this, or on the basis of earlier maneuver a intuitive, logical reaction so that it uses running merely a handful of KB memory. 
It needs no gigabyte memories and megabyte of heavy memories. 
This is the first step under development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, that will be after estimation of Nissan within the next ten years standard in production. 
A further use could find the technology in the GPS satellite navigation in that it directs the driver deliberately around hindrances around and leads it so at the goal.
