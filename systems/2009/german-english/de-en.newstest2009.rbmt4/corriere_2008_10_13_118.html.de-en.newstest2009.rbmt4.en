The super glue that lets rise at walls 
To overcome the powers of the gravity thanks to a glue and to be able to climb up walls like Superman. 
This is the object of four American research centers of which one now apparently almost on target arrived is. 
With a glue raised on an area by only 2.5 qcm, it is arrive the researchers to fix a 100 kg of heavy body on a vertical wall. 
The STUDIOS – an American periodical has, has the results of the researcher of the university of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory publishes. 
The material invented by the researcher team is a further development of the already related glues, which a special carbon structure, named carbon nanotube, use. 
"The principle of the glue can one itself like a row to a pile Spaghetti of arranged tubes introduce", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists have inspire let themselves of the feet of the Geckos, which are covered by microscopic Härchen, that give the animal a perfect stop. 
The tests carried out with different materials such as glass of Teflon and bow paper showed that the new glue is ten times stronger, than the stop capacity of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "without problem by the wall remove lets", so Liming Dai, researcher of the faculty for engineer sciences of the university of Dayton. 
AT WALLS ENTLANGWANDERN? "These materials could as a transitory glue used become", sets Liming Dai thereto. 
Close upwards about around like Spiderman at walls? Perhaps already, but the researchers think are sooner of a less fascinating utility, like about the connection of electric devices, for the nanotubes just as leader of warmth and electricity. 
Further use zones could fall into the area of the space flight. 
For the moment, the super heros yet must wait therefore. 
THE OTHER TYPE OF THE RESEARCH – also the university of Berkeley, California, dedicates itself a new glue type. 
In an article of the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present clean themselves a glue out of Mikrofasern that like hairs through movement on a surface itself of the dust and preserve through it always a perfect liability.
