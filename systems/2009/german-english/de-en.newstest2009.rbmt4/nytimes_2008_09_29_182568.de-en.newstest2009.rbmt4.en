The back door of the music club CBGB, the Punkrockdenkmals that was closed in 2006 opened is "stretched itself to the extra Place and the street certainly most well known as a scenery for the photo on the cover of the album to Russia" of Ramones. 
The pavement was magnificent, said Danny Fields, that manager of the Ramones, who had made the photo in November 1976. 
The street was full of scrap, rag and parts of casks, postal services, leaves and rope. 
Some inhabitants, including the blogger, who write over the Gentrifizierung of the East Village, rejected the idea of the sale of extra Place, with which argument that this public plot of land is, as modest as it, further should remain public. 
Others praised extra Place as a rarity – a practically unchanged gravel of the city that should be let in quiet.

The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that remains even during the day dark and is" marked through rusted metal door of the warehouse halls, locked windows and on rain groove past flying week old newspapers. 
With few exceptions, the street has exactly so recently at one evening looked. 
A rat ran through the rear part of the street, far of the door, that did not lead earlier to the CBGB, where today a more expensive clothing business is. 
Graffiti were to be seen on the walls and lay an empty beer bottle on the ground not far of a fresh bundle of junked newspapers. 
Some passersby said, they would have thought about struck rarely over extra Place, but before that the street could polish up become something. 
Fields, added that after its opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the street in its current condition. 
The best years of my life, said it, were in the places, that were dark, damp and disgusting.
