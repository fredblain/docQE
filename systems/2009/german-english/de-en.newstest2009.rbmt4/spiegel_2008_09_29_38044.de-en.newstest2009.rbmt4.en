Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box 
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, at the first school day at the Tachibana Highschool imagine should, catch to giggle the girls on: The German is total "kawaii"! 
What means that? 
Sylvana knows the word already out of one gas - in the new exchange put told it of Japan. 
"The school day first in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Already before the school way, I had Bammel. 
I live at the edge of Tokyo toward Kawasaki and go 40 minutes with the train to the Tachibana Highschool. 
I had to find the way alone, did not pass myself to the good fortune I. 
The instruction start does not seem determined at the Tachibana so exertally like here at home in Lower Saxony. 
The students drift in from eight o'clock until around twenty before nine a short discussion round with the teacher begins, the 'home room'. 
Yet before the instruction began, I was at the row to imagine. 
At the same time I am not at all the type, that speaks gladly before people, yet in addition before a class of 40 students. 
Because I still had no school uniform, I dressed an old skirt of my guest mother, in addition blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes. 
In this procession, I stood therefore before the pulpit and try to express all correctly: 'Sayonara where she Sylvana ...' - Sylvana am named I, come from Germany and would have birthday in a week. 
In the moment, I was very happily that I had begun already before well two years to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class whispered, giggled and waved everyone and continuously I heard the word "Kawaii". 
I knew that already out of mine one gas. 
It belongs to the over vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'. 
Then I scurried quickly on my place. 
The girl next to me rather extend grinned, it found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to it. 
The remainder of the hour was tinted rather quiet, but as the gong, was stormed I regular. 
Everyone spoke in confusion and giggled and asked me holes into the belly - at the same time is to be understood it really heavy, Japanese English. 
In the recess, all its Bentos unpacked then. 
My guest mother had made me also so a Lunchbox - that is once something else as the odes of German recess breads. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad out of cucumber and algae, fruit and a type meat in the Tofumantel. 
Usually I have no pale shimmer what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
The things look remarkably and taste totally novel. 
Festival stands that all is really delicious. 
Naja, up to the salty inserted plums perhaps, brrrr! 
The Bentos are at Japanese schools not only simple lunch. 
It occurs sometimes that a girl gives a boy an even prepared Bento, that it then especially skillful arranges - in the hope to learn more closely know the boy in the Pausensnack. 
Therefrom I read in my Manga comic strip. 
I am strained once whether I can observe that here also. 
'Why calculated then Japan?', asked me my friends when I told them, that I want to go for a year in Tokyo to the school. 
I then always said: 
"Because it me now once fasziniert." 
In the end I have read already for years most dearly one gas. 
And therewith I the comic strip and the culture therein better would understand, began I also sometime to learn a little Japanese. 
For me was therefore totally clear that I had to travel sometime here. 
For I have also a Faible for tradition, customs and customs. 
And on that, one puts here large value. 
On the one hand Japan is a country of the newest technologies and trend - on the other side is it severe, disciplines and traditionally. 
And because all is organized so well, I felt here also not yet lost, also if Tokyo is the largest city, that I habe. ever seen".
