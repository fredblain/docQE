In the choices on Sunday it created no delegate of the opposition into the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers my, this would be assumes at the prosperity and stability in the country led of Alexander Lukaschenko, the OECD law adversity to be sure about the counting the voices. 
The OECD, that out of 43 countries 450 observers dispatched, did not acknowledge the choices. 
De legislature of the 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates million 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates has come out to be sure for decades without opposition. Nevertheless that seriously hoped for itself the powers" (ODS) democratic under the name "united met against party before the choices of yesterday that Lukaschenko, that in the unclean choices and thanks to a constitution change 2006 its presidency mandate renewed already for the fourth time, this time some delegates of the opposition in the parliament would become "allow". 
Therefore the ODS took even distance of the boycotts planned before. 
The Ukraine becomes more and more thanks to the increasing prices in the natural gas import of Russia economically more dependent. For the relief of the price increases, even credit were received, and the country has also the sale of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country at which Russians agreed. In the background of the expectations of the opposition, the hope, the Ukraine stood wanted improve therefore its ratio with the EU after Lukaschenko and other high-ranking politicians have because of the system classified political as antidemokratisch in the EUS entry bans. 
For a temporary relaxation provided the analysis reports of the choices of the OECD, in which the emphasis lay sooner on the positive movements, instead of on the deficiencies - like about the exclusion of one-third of the opposition candidates of the choices -. 
To be sure the campaign - accordingly might opposition in the press occur - and especially the fact did not criticize the fast reports of the OECD already on Monday that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the voices. 
In spite of all that, the opposition is able to do recognize an improvement in the political system: Political prisoners were set about at liberty, and Minsk is even to smaller confrontations with Moscow ready in that it denies further the recognition of the independence of the disloyal Georgian provinces south Ossetien and Abchasien, although Russia, with which the Ukraine forms on the paper a federal country, that has regarded both zones for a month as independent.

In the opinion of the opposition candidate of the presidency choices of 2006 is a continuation desirable although "the powerful anxieties got, also to let" only an opposition into the parliament. 
The opposition plans no protest measures in view of the results, but rather to make tried sooner the necessity of an economy reform the voters clear. 
"We have here with many problems to fight - the opposition newspapers must in Russia printed become, the local authorities put us in the banish stone in the way, but nevertheless see I, that more and more person the change support, even the older" - said Milinkewitsch in allusion on that, that not once the most supported layer the Pensionisten with the Lukaschenko regime agreed is, whose single salary the manufacture social security is. 
"Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the climb of the trade deficit, it is begins bare a matter of time to crumble until that at the quiet security social a cemetery gemahnende""", so Milinkewitsch. 
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers have the choices as democratic designated. 
Sergej Lebedev, leader of the mission of the partnership independent countries explained the news agency Ria Novosti: "The persons do not believe the deeds, and the words". Let the lack of the opposition be therefore a proof of the maturity of the white Russian voters.
