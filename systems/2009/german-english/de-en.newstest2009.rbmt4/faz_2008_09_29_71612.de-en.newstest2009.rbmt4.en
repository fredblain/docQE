Düsseldorfer hopes rest on Frankfurt 
At large words, it is not missing in the letter of the WestLB board of directors at the colleagues of the house. 
Through a bringing together of units the Düsseldorfer money institute with that Frankfurt Deka bank "the central money market house of the savings bank finance group" could emerge, is named it in the letter well known become on Monday. 
The WestLB would bring in a "competence block" with persistent yield power into such a business. 
And generally such a connection could be the decisive impetus to further alliance lungs in the country bank sector. 
So it reads if a board of directors in difficult time wants to demonstrate action capacity. 
For the marred WestLB is as always under powerful pressure. 
Not only on the part of the EU commission, but rather also through the federal agency for finance service supervision, that made clear that state government North Rhine-Westphalian not until recently, that would press time to find a future solution. 
Of one like always natured connections between the Deka bank, that know savings bank customer because of its Investmentsfonds, and the WestLB has been to be sure already for some time the speech - also on Frankfurt side. 
To be sure Deka-bank-boss Franz Waas has know let the end of August in the model of the half year numbers, in a fusion of the house at the Mainzer country road with a country bank, about the Helaba or the WestLB, would see he no sense. 
Yet the supervisory board of the Deka, that is carried ever to the half by the country banks and the savings bank associations, that board of directors delegates has to lead with the WestLB discussions about joint business activities. 
At the same time it could concern the money market business or parts therefrom. 
The conversations have to be sure, is named begun it at the finance place, just recently. 
Of the Deka bank, that is with its 3000 colleagues among the more important employers at the finance place Frankfurt, the speech is not for the first time if it concerns consolidation in the savings bank sector. 
It looked 2003 a moment long so, as could the Deka bank with the country bank Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba merge. 
Out of this threefold alliance, became nothing however. 
Hardly the plans had become public, spoke themselves the Hessian state government against a participation of the Helaba on that from. 
Also the two other houses found then not together. 
The country bank Rhineland-Palatinate went instead of its at the country bank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. 
Yet there was again and again thought game over a connection of the Deka bank with country banks. 
Finally Günther Merl, chairman of the board of the Helaba had expressed itself to be sure, against simulations over a going together with its house. 
Independently therefrom the insight seems to ripen however that a moving together of the different houses of the publicly legal sector need does. 
After now the Regional Diet Election in Bavaria is past, a connection of the BayernLB with the country bank Baden-Württemberg could nearer move first. 
For the Helaba, that is not unconditional a good message. 
The pressure to further fusions should go climbing, its gradually the partners for that from. 
In the south, it would be nurmehr junior partner although it has previously by far better stood through the finance crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
The savings bank association and endorsement association Hesse Thuringia, that is involved with 85 percent in the Helaba, advanced a going together with the west LB again, beginning of the year a bar. 
If remained in any case the norths LB. 
Such geostrategical considerations are however only the one side. 
On the other, it concerns the question how the different business models of the single houses fit to each other. 
In June Merl expressed, that decisive question, with which business model the future capacity of the country banks should be guaranteed, savings bank association and endorsement association had been answered by the German not yet. 
At the end, also a dismantling could stand the west LB, that not even speaking is wished to be sure there. 
So the speech is would be striven for then also in the letter of the board of directors there therefrom, it in any case a "total solution" for the house. 
How the units single with the going together with the Deka bank lets bring under a hat, yet will appear.
