You are, yourself you announce over you 
On the occasion of its tenth birthday, Google can justifiably maintain: it is to be found in the pockets of the persons just as, like over its beheading in the sky: It knows where the persons spent its vacation, to which specialty physicians they go, and what moves it. 
And therewith still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the manager of Google. 
Toward skeptic, who are plagued by Orwellschen horror visions, he lets align: These would survey just the essential of the Web 2.0. 
In an interview with the financial Times, Schmidt meant would be recently, the main goal of Google it to gather yet more personal data over the users and to come so the original objective of the firm more closely according to what it wanted organize" "all information of this world. 
Schmidt explained, let Google be after ten years of world changing work still first at the start of the information gathering. 
Ask meant about the status Quo in five years Schmidt: he wished for, Google would be in a position, questions such as "what should I tomorrow do?" or "which job fits really to me?" to answer, to be sure would be software program not yet in a position in addition because it would know not enough over the users. 
All Internets users are not themselves about that in the clear that in the train of its Internet investigation the that which is sought concepts would be registered, as well as also the IP ADDRESSES of which out of sought became, and the visited sides. 
To store for example the two years ago introduced "Personalized Search" permitted the visitor its own that which is sought course and to fall back later on that so that the hits can be generated later much more precise, and on the same logic also the so named "Recommendations", with which the system recommends products tailor-made and services based on the earlier preferences, are based. 
The users ask happens - "if one checks, what I make" - appear provides to be sure, what in the case a data abuse themselves some whether the Google data monopoly. 
In most cases, it is however sooner the power represented, potential by the firm that causes fear exciting, and fewer the compunction or the fear of punishment, that striving after freedom or the rebellion against the power, that bumps at many Internets users into rejection. 
It is to be sure a proved fact that the that which is sought concepts not only stored, but rather in the occasion case also at third transmitted become, and in these law cases, there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user. 
A prime example for this was submitted lately the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the train its Google of the Brazilian government information, that were gathered by the partnership sites by the name of "Orkut", and also an identification of the pedophilias of enabled. 
Users concerned around personal rights were able to breathe a sigh of relief however yet in May, pulled when Google jointly with the civil right organization EFF successfully against the FBI before court: accordingly can Google also in the future with no point of the constitution in addition forced become to publish information the FBI on secret inquiry. 
(To be sure has the Federal Government successfully the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 that which is sought concepts with reference to the years ago dismissed child and youth protection legislation obtains, to be sure became its the list of the single user, or its Web list and that which is sought concept list on two months retroactively withhold). 
Googles image remains therefore disputed: That that publish its personal data unwillingly because they fear the loss of its privacy and Intimsph√§re through the use of the google services, scourges the business with that the of firms conservatively representing itself proper rebellion. 
Meanwhile the American "Geek culture" sees that is present in many countries and enthused computer fans, activists and user eint, that next generation of the "cool entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, that is thanks to windows market leader, also if both fight for the same goal. 
A possible reason for this is that Google demands its user in contrast to Microsoft no identification codes, and makes available its services free of charge so that an open source code permanently updated and program Package seem to be far more attractively, more youthfully and more coolly, than the official practices of the software giant. 
On the other hand the Geeks look through the problematic ratio of the personal rights and the Internet razor-sharply - a ratio that is moved especially in the past years thanks to the concept "Web 2.0" into the midpoint. 
In the "Web 2.0", it concerns leave behind namely nothing of other, when around Kollaboration, sprich, the users intentionally traces and utilize the available communication canals, and also if the sizes are individually different, the essential matter remains that, namely itself publicly to show. 
An average youth can be administer simultaneously on several partnership portals profile - of Facebook over Xanga, can read interconnect can bind this by means of other services, like about Twitter, or music services how. fm, and all this in the end into an after pursuit system such as about FriendFeed or Blip. fm. In addition they can lead blogs, that automatically represent the newest photo galleries, that are on Flickr or Picasa geostet. 
And a row of further exemplary cases proves: In the observing of the party photos of the past night, the friend will find out soon, with whom its unfaithful friend amused himself, or the colleague will release because he makes in its blog only all too honestly its vexation at the business management air - one is certain: The concept "privacy" completely newly was interpreted meanwhile. 
Who leads an Online life, is that, what it of itself sacrifices - so in about could formulate one the reason idea behind the behavior of the current youth. 
And who tries to hold somewhat secretly, or to go around quite the google monopoly, can do that gladly - like about with Scroogle, a tool, that take action to be sure on the search engine of Google, to be sure intentionally no traces leaves behind. 
Few persons do not register intentionally not on partnership sides so that they are not detectable, but also the Online applications of Google, like about word-processings and graphic tools and RSS Feeds, let themselves go around with alternative versions, that are tied to no gigantic server parks and do not generate therefore also the optimum profile of the user. 
The public opinion waits banned meanwhile on that until Google shows its true face. 
With its present value of USD 156 billions the business lies threaten the receipts of the advertising agencies even before IBM (USD 140 billions), Intel (USD 124 billions) or Coca Cola (USD 110 billions), the advertise areas of AdWords/AdSense, and not only Microsoft prepare the always faster introduced services, but rather also other software developer worry. 
Critical spectators find to be sure also the disturbing against poles: So about the group direction completely rejected a protest of the colleague after the fees of the firm inclined kindergarten were doubled, moreover the management, the multiple provisions of the colleague meant would be too costly. That everything seems however quite mildly on the other hand that Google in 2006 went before the Chinese government even into the knees and was agreed with an agreement according to what all regime critical hits would be filtered out, or that that violate the good taste. 
The internal regulation of the group reads that in advance no new service is applied, but rather is first if this also already available. Nevertheless the events of the coming months and years strongly could change radically again a few things: During some my, Googles book and Magazinscan- and/or archiving project would suppose meanwhile sizes that the business would have to explain itself soon with the waiter court, are disturbed other rather because of the system "Health", that enables the creation of a complete health profile on the basis of conditions, physicians and problems. 
And the fact that Google constructs a genetic database, delivers the next generation of the Sci Fi authors already the material - about "Scroogled", that famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes in best orwellschen manner a future in which a person becomes thanks to data related by Google frightening closely cash.
