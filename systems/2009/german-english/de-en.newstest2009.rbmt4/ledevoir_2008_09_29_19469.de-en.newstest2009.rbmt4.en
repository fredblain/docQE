Conference - of the blood that again certain became 
Hema Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had herself all reason to please, for Hema Quebec became one of the most certain and most efficient blood banks of the world. 
And above all it recovered the confidence of the public, that heavily had been shaken through the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980 and '1990's. 
How one knows, the blood reserves administered national by the blood donation service the Canadian Red Cross had contaminated during the '1980's with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus. 
In view of this drama and the discontent of the public, the government of Canada initiated in February 1994 a public investigation led by the judge Horace Krever, that had as a goal of bringing light into the circumstances, that had led to such a tragedy, and guidelines to prepare, around a renewed catastrophe of this type to prevent. 
While judge Krever yet hesitated to deliver its report, several provinces placed at that time a committee on the legs whose goal it was of developing a new system to the administration of stored blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau fulfilled this order. 
After the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema Quebec that is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company in order to furnish the other provinces and both territories. 
`1998 when Hema Quebec received its work, had hardly 38% of the people confidence into the stored blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
To improve through the enormous exertions around the security of the stored blood and through the work on this zone during the following years, we recovered the confidence of the public', say it before it emphasizes proudly, that beginning 2008 had meanwhile almost 94% of the population of Quebec confidence in Hema Quebec. 
Dr. Décary retains is however in the consciousness, that `Vertrauen somewhat extremely fragile'. 
Since its foundation on the 28th of September 1998, Hema Quebec acts after the principle of the caution. 
To this time of experienced we the appearance of numerous cases of the human form mad cow disease in Europe with, a new type of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-illness, tells this woman, that has in the direction since the foundation 1998. 
`Und we had not the slightest premonition whether this illness could be transmitted over the blood. 
Therefore we referred to one of the head guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, that according to one from end measures uses, if one does not know this and if an illness only slowly advances, how it is obviously in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-illness the case, that expresses itself through a degeneration of the brain, what leads inevitable to death. 
Therefore one supposed in April 1999 no blood of persons, that had stayed since 1980 more long than a month in the united kingdom. 
Now, some years ago was proved without any doubt that this illness is transmitted over the blood. 
So showed us this event that the principle of the caution that we used has, thoroughly a sense. 
1999 appear a much more exact technology to the recognition of HIV on the market: The nucleic acids tests (NST), that it do not enable to prove directly in the blood of the donor the occurrence of the virus itself, and that of the antibody against the virus how it was in the previously related tests the case. 
The NST of enabled it that to shorten incubation time, that between the moment, to which the person was infected and that if the first viruses by our technologies in the blood proved will can, takes place, explains the specialist. 
This time could be reduced on a duration by less than a week. 
So the risk became not that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one this recognize could, diminishes substantially. 
These improvements of enabled it, that risk to transmit, AIDS over a blood transfusion, to sink in considerable mass. 
Nowadays runs one of 12 million persons danger to receive infected blood with HIV. 
`Mit other words is named that that one would have to distribute 12 million stored blood, before someone would be infected with HIV. 
Because Hema Quebec distributes each year between 400,000 and 500,000 stored blood, it would last more than 24 years before a case appears, with which HIV became transmit over a stored blood. 
I believe that one probably can feel nowadays at the same time, if one gets or prescribes a blood transfusion to restore around the health', mean the direction boss of Hema Quebec. 
It that to receive security of our products is `Unsere challenge for the next ten years. 
One never knows, which pathogen can arrive into the system. 
Not until the past year the Chikungunya virus emerged on the island Réunion, that just as the west Nile virus is transmitted, by insects over the blood. 
We uninterruptedly must supervise', go Dr. Décary away before it emphasizes, that Hema Quebec must make available a sufficient provision next to a certain provision moreover. 
`Der requirement climbs because the population ages. 
Because the treatments to the cancer fight are more aggressive, the patients need often new red blood bodies or blood platelet. 
The over aging of the population affects also the blood donor network, to which in the average only 3% of the inhabitant of Quebec suitable to the blood donation belong. ' 
At the same time every healthy person, who more old is 18 years or and fulfills the fitness criteria, every 56 days, therefore six times per year can, contribute blood. 
In the average are not supposed 14% of the persons, that make available its blood, because they became ill for example with AIDS or malaria, and who traveled into a country, in which malaria is spread, becomes for a year of the blood donation excluded. 
We create `Mit this 3% it to receive an inventory, that corresponds to the needs of the hospitals. 
Lacking supplies are very rare. 
But one must renew the members of this donor network if they more old can become and can contribute no more blood. 
It is to be held heavily to convince the people, to contribute, above all however, blood it and to bring it in addition, to become regular donors. 
Life is nowadays so hectically that one finds rarely the time to spend an hour in the blood donation', regrets Francine Décary. 
With a year budget of 297 million dollars, Hema Quebec delivers not only stored blood, but rather also human tissues, under that bone transplants, heart lids, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively in heavy fire injuries. 
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored between in Hema Quebec, that also the single public navel cord of blood bank Quebec administers. 
In the navel cord, that was observed earlier than a biomedical refuse, rich blood that can serve in addition is at stem cells, heavy illnesses, like for example leukemia, to treat. 
We celebrated `Vor some weeks the deposit of our thousandth navel cord blood sample, and we plan to decrease annually more than thousand. 
`Wir should begin probably beginning next year therewith to make available it for transplantation', explains decrease describes Dr. Décary further, that this program of the Nabelschnurblut- than very popularly. 
`Viele mothers are convinced to have no access in addition', for Hema Quebec are missing the means to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals of Quebec.
