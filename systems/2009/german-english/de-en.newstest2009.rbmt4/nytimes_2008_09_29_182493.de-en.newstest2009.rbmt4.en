Debate around bilingual education: Development in English language environment 
In this edition of the "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T discuss. Izumi the positions of the candidates to the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific colleague in Kalifonischen studies and leading director in the field development science at the Pacific Research institute for Public Policy, is thinks a co-author of the beech "not so well how one: Why the middle class of a school selection needs". 
To address the hispanischen voters a complicated task is. 
Barrack Obamas suggestions to the subject of development are a typical example for that. 
Obamas choice campaign mentioned is, to lock that "the probability in afro American and hispanischen students the school successfully, more low, than with white students" - what agrees. 
In order to close this achievement distance, Obamas development plan recommends specially transition phase one bilingual under other in training for that, that first learn English. 
Nevertheless the question exists be at Obama therein, whether use for the bilingual education, that puts the focal point on instruction in other languages as English, to reduce its interest contradicts, the distance in the school achievements. 
Let's take "Sixth street Prep", an elementary school in the eastern Los Angeles as an example. 
Hispanisch are the majority of the student and come out of families with low income. 
More than a third of the student, of which many are only recently in the country, learn English. 
Nevertheless students of the fourth class insisted into 2008 astonishing 100 percent the country test in Mathe on a good level. 
Also surprisingly 93 percent of the children became out of the fourth school year in the English test as good valued. 
This astonishing success was reached with other methods when that that are preferred by Obama. 
The school Sixth street puts its focal point on examination and practice, on steady inspection of the knowledge and a bearing, that tolerates no exceptions. 
The expanse practice the school the extension after which the education in an English language environment passes. Exact that is the point that Obama should note, so the school leader Linda Mikels. 
This extension places importance on that almost Exclusively use of the English language in the specialty instruction. 
Woman Mikels, that rejects the idea of bilingual education, said would have take place by means of to me, that a remarkable a student, who had come first shortly before that from Mexico, to school. One later would can entered 12 months the classroom and recognize it no longer. 
"It functions", noticed in it, "it functions for us". 
Would Obama take a school such as the "Sixth street Prep" as a model for other schools with large share in Latin American and other students learning English? 
The achievements of the school easily would make the answer on this question, but the development political positions within its own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support already long the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of the bilingual education make predictions over Obamas answer uncertain. 
While it agrees with the point, that immigrants should learn English, it has recently the subject of trivialisiert in that it noticed in, that persons should stop, worries over that on legislation aiming "only English" make itself. 
Instead, it said: "You should guarantee that your child can" Spanish. 
If Obama actually wants to close the achievement distance, it should consider carefully development models, that function instead of despising it and to trivialisieren.
