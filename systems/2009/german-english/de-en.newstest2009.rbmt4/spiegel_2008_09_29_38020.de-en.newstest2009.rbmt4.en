Also rats have feelings 
Does a rat or a Schabe escape is named that in danger that it perceives also fear? 
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Also much animals have feelings. 
Only how could one review whether they perceive the same, if they behave similar to we? 
In the Internet periodical "Edge" are published for several years contributions of famous scientist. 
Does SPIEGEL ONLINE present consider selected answers in a series on the question "what you to be aware without being able to prove it?" 
I do not believe that animals have perceptions and other consciousness conditions, without that I or somebody otherwise this previously prove could where we once prove can that other persons have consciousness. 
But in this case, we at least may hope because all human brains show the same basic configuration. 
As soon as we turn to however other species and questions of the perceiving cut or very generally the consciousness, let's enter unwegsames terrain because the hardware does not agree. 
If a rat runs in danger, it does the same like many other animals: It stands dead, flees or grasps on. 
Persons behave similarly wherefrom many scientists close on a comparable subjective experiencing. 
On that I do not believe to be sure. 
Two aspects of the brain structure make it hard to transfer our subjective experiencing to that of animals. 
To the one, the switching circuits associated almost always with the human consciousness close laughed since that prefrontal Cortex a (because of its participation in the short time memory and at the execution functions / control functions). 
This wide region more highly is developed in humans much than at the remaining primates and seems to be absent from other creatures completely. 
At least in those aspects of our consciousness, that depend on the prefrontal Cortex to decide under that the knowledge who we are, and the ability to plan and, exists therefore reason to the acceptance that the person differs even of the other primates. 
A further dramatic singularity would be allowed to lie in the linguistic nature of the person: Because a so large part of its experiencing is connected with language, is named it often, the consciousness would hang therefrom off. 
In this case, one could exclude animals. 
Yet also if consciousness would not depend on language, this certainly would influence it so that animal consciousness likes to procure be itself, how it also, probably very of that our consciousness would accrue would distinguish. 
Therefore is to be determined heavily how consciousness likes to look at other animals. 
If it yet neither measure itself, when something internal and subjective,, because of the special hardware, on the basis of our own experience analyze lets, places us its investigation before large problems. 
That of my executions have references to the contents of the aware experiencing, but there is beside it another further aspect of the consciousness that would be allowed to be scientifically more simply accessible. 
One could examine happens the consciousness processes of animals without consideration on its contents, and exactly that in studies over the short time memory of primates, especially by the example of the visualization. 
Yet in this extension, that Christof cook and Francis investigated cracked, one transfers himself sooner to the neural correlates of the consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: Both identically like to be or also not. 
Interestingly enough this extension emphasizes also the meaning of the prefrontal Cortex for the realization of the visualization. 
What arises now for the perceptions? 
I would cut back it on that that an emotional system such as the brain aware the fear in one its own activity is activated. 
What we designate as a "fear", is therefore the mental condition in which we find us, if the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, how physical reactions) memory covers. 
So seen are perceptions closely at the regions the Cortex bound, that price primates and especially the person. 
Connected with the linguistic nature, fine gradation of the perceiving arise because we can differentiate and categorize by means of the words and the grammar of conditions in order to attribute it next to us even also others. 
On the other hand Antonio Damasio means follow for example, that perceptions out of more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the Cortex and the brain tribe similarly Jaak Pankseep that however more concentrates on the brain tribe. 
Because this network in the course of the human evolution had not changed very, it could be involved thoroughly in gattungs√ºbergreifenden perceptions. 
Purely theoretically I cannot contradict that, consider it however to be unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues, would feel, what would appear with rats and persons such as fear, probably also in both cases so on: How however could one review whether rats and persons perceive the same, if they similarly behave? 
Does a Schabe escape in danger whether also it perceives fear? 
In my eyes, bare behavior resemblance yet no Erlebensgleichheit can prove. 
To be sure the neural comparison helps further: Rats and persons have similar brain tribes, pushed on the other hand not once a brain. 
Is the brain tribe but for perceptions responsible? 
And even if one could prove that for the person: How did one want to prove it with rats? 
Do I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even pushed (who knows?), perceptions have. 
But I would not know how I should prove that. 
And because its perceptions differ probably basically of that ours, (there the human consciousness on special switching circuits and on language rests), I investigate rather the emotional behavior than the emotional perceptions of rats. 
In any case progress waves here on the neural plain as far as one measures the same with rats and persons. 
How I do not investigate language and consciousness with rats, as well as not perceptions, knows I yet not whether they exist. 
One likes to consider that to be short-sighted, but I come rather ahead to run than permanent against a wall. 
I am even an emotional ware practical.
