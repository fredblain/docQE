Letter - a disgraced country 
Mr. Vic Toews, former' justice' -minister (what irony) in the cabinet Harper it that permitted itself last summer was, to say over Louise Arbour, it would be a `Schande' for Canada. 
This woman, the one do not end led has wanting battle for the justice and earns all our admiration to cover so with disgrace, says just as much over the persons around the prime minister around from, like over Stephen Parker itself. 
We have it here with a government to do, that did not get its compatriot caught in the concentration camp Guantanamo as only out of all the concerned countries home. 
A government that does not consider once that Omar Khadr was another youth, when the things happened, that are reproached for it. 
The single government, that in spite of the fact that Canada the Genevans convention signs has, its word breaks and vegetate there lets a child soldier under inhuman conditions. 
The only, that lets out here itself to a justice parody, in order to estimate the guilt of the accused. 
Let's call us in memory that above all UNICEF, Amnesty International and the union of the Canadian lawyers plead for that to get Omar Khadr home so that he gets a just process in Canada. 
Exactly this government locks also the eyes before the torture: It interests it few that a young more adult after so many years of the torment certainly for always mentally broken be becomes. 
We are not ourselves its yet aware, but we experience sounds here just an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our `Demokratie', this word, that carries Harper permanently like a flag before itself here, and that out of its mouth so meaningless. 
The time came therefore, in which it gives no moral at all more: One arbitrarily may mistreat, torture and lock in a Canadian citizen, becomes may belong entirely at discretion of a head of the government, that until today only of the minority supported (he after the 14th of October entirely the minority. ..). 
Many voters believe to find its well-being at a party, that preaches virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government renounced itself of that, what the call and that would become our country settled. 
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere differently.
