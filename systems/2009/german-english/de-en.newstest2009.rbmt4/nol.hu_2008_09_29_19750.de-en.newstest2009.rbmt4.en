Christian Socialist Union: Grace on credit 
The end of October is decided over the fate of the fallen duo strokes Beckstein 
In spite of the choice debacle, yet no heads roll were adjourned meanwhile, at the tip of the Bavarian Christian Socialist Union the personnel discussions. 
Party chief of Erwin strokes and Prime Minister Beckstein remain yet in its offices, the question is only how long preserves this grace. 
Over the fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent voice loss is decided at the last October weekend in the extraordinary party convention. 
The much scolded duo let however already look through that it would not like to glue on its armchairs. 
Therewith they want to soothe the annoyed parliamentary group and the party basis, that a day consequences personal after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss the absolute majority demanded. 
Five years ago - admitted, under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber standing at its career highpoint - the Christian social union reached yet 60.7 percent. Now to be sure, a year after the coup against Stoiber they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the voices. 
The Christian Socialist Union was for 46 years "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria, that gains 18 percent of the German GDP. 
The conservatives remain to be sure the decisive power in the state important southern also for the Hungarian economy, will have to reign however in the future in a coalition. 
The potential successor becomes heard bound as the first sign the party internal restructurings Hubers, vice president and federal minister of agriculture Seehofer also into the reconnaissance team, that leads with the liberal FDP, or the to the right arranged "free voters" of probe conversations over a possible citizen of Munich coalition. 
It comes an irony of the fate same that with the list "free voters" that Gabriele Pauli comes in into the legislature, whose Anti Stoiber appearance first utilized from the stroke Beckstein duo, in order to clear then the purposeful politician graceless. 
The Christian Socialist Union leadership concentrates now all its powers on the stabilization Becksteins. 
In this transition process, Stoiber, that until now the threads pulled out of the background, becomes, approach an active roll. The former Prime Minister and Christian Socialist Union chairperson named the 28th of September the "most bitter day of its political course". 
On Monday a couple of comments poisonous made strokes toward Christian Democratic Union - in its opinion would have earned the Christian Socialist Union far more support of the sister party. 
Other Christian Socialist Unions politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal at the Christian Democratic Union and therewith also at Angela Merkel. 
The Christian Socialist Union, that contributed 2005 also on more national plain much to the success, should not be placed can become, with a joint feat of strength again on the legs, Merkel after the Bundestag elections in September 2009 not again chancellor. 
Merkel, that made no Hehl out of its disappointment over the fiasco, believes that the grounds loss of the Christian Socialist Union will not affect negatively the large coalition in Berlin. 
What is relative to be sure: The wounded Christian Socialist Union will be, to not to reign more easily, and the crisis of the social democrats goes meanwhile further. 
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has reached its result best until now in Bavaria for 1946.
