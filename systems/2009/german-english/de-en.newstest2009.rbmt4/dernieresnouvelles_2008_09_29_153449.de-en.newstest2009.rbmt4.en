The speed of this encounter with which the aggressors had effort to show its ability, was not very high. 
After a first attack of the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot went past tightly the angle, should dominate Illhäusern with lightness the game, and it succeeded alternating first Fonderflick with a distance shot to demand then brain with a high passport, and Romany with a shot with the foot tip, the defense of Denmark. 
The hostile team blocked in the field middle and let only the lively Riahi at the tip of the storm through. 
The start of the second half-time should be decisively with first of all two through Riahi and temporal fought for gate chances, and equally after that with the first gate for the Illhäuser through Marais, that exactly correctly stood in order to suppose a ball again, that had been defended in a first attempt of Diebold. 
Yet the illhäusische scorer should not be enjoy can good fortune long and sent become about twelve minutes later on the bank by what means its team comrades must numerically been subject expanse play. 
Denmark however knew not to exploit this and stood retracted an illhaeusischen eleven no large problems toward, that only a few, around its defense to `verdichten' except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball went past after a large disorder very nearly the slat.
