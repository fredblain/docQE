The elite are in danger 
The phenomenon had reveals itself already some days ago when the delegate chamber agreed against the 700 billion-dollar-save package of the white house: A large part of the American was and is interested to rescue more on that to punish the Wall Street than the economy. 
This is confirmed the edition of yesterday of the New York Times that reports therefrom, how the crisis in the course step the republican party separates, that more and more splits into its old and moderate East Coast soul, who always the national institutions and the businesses community favored and that neokonservative, that "which hostily stands in opposition in Washington" and the finance world and wins v. a. in the south and the center of the countries voter. 
This part of the party owes its ascent v. a. the voice of its that I mentioned above. 
This example mentioned just now is meanwhile only a small part of the large variations, that announces or even already represents the momentary economic earthquake: not only in the USA, also in the total west and perhaps also over this out will be concerned by this. 
Both in the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events, which suppose shape under these new conditions finally and come at the light. 
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the shocking renaissance of the country in connection with a type Renationalisierung of the economy. 
In the deed, the crisis means a decline of the bank institutions and finance institutions, which narrow connection to foreign countries possess and administer at the same time an enormous quantity of the fortunes of private households, that live in a single country. 
This means a direct political problem for the governments: namely like it vis-à-vis the concerned families to behave counts, which represent also a voter mass enormous. 
The crisis appears is therefore economically globally, politically on the other hand it almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems so at itself in that to one side of run to be and to have lost its speech right: The clear proof for this was given by the EU, which knows to find based on its division into different national and international conflicts no joint way. 
Therefore all reckon now with the intervention of the own country; rescue plans, new rules, and v. a. distribution of auxiliary fund: Since the crisis became more and more more serious, the USA in the situation economical is to be rescued itself solely without strange aid. 
And next to the means, they possess to use in addition also the authorization this: therefore two not to over valued prerequisites – under certain circumstances –, on which otherwise probably no international organization and no market in more similar manner will be able to fall back. 
That new stress, that is put on the nationally national element, is in the remaining in perfect harmony with the always larger meaning, that is connected most young the economy with one on the close relative sector in: the Territorialität. 
It is were more paradoxical manner just now, than we yet so convinced to have entered a long time into a networked total empire, into an empire of the always differentiated technologies, the immaterial that we must assess all at once, like our future yet more and more of the essentially material things depend becomes: Water, harvest and oil. 
These can be transported to be sure certainly all by a place at that others the world, are connected however nevertheless on extreme with a closely circumscribed piece earth – a territory. 
Therefore that that controls such a territory is, one of other vis-à-vis, that in a harvest unproductive, waterless or of oil occurrence free zone lives, in the advantage. 
I come now to the second novelty, that prefaces however a short on push. 
Who, who government, who says politics, therewith also Leadership says to territory. 
In this sense, the finance crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand the knowledge is there around the necessity of esteemed Leaderships, therefore the need after someone, who knows, how one regulates the things. 
On the other side, a wave of the indignation exists now over the existing leaderships, v. a. that the economy which turned out to be insufficient and full shadow zones. 
Thereto a deep passing and in certain sense yet disturbing aspect comes in the end: A loss of trust, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of the distance that is based altogether on an entire class of managers of the western countries. 
It seems to clear itself so the conviction under large parts of the population the way that it would not be first the deeds of the social elite, but rather already its idea world, its Way of Life, its culture in the broadest sense of the word,, whose salary represents come over itself the majority as always more strangely and. 
The demand after Leadership nourishes branched therefore underground one however powerful movement of the deprivation of power of the leading class and the conventional political Establishments. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voter and in the sudden reversal of the collective mind condition of the last time: beginning with the ascent of the conservative in Austria and Bavaria, over the breakdown of the Labour party in Great Britain, there to the rebellion of the American delegates against Bush (and perhaps plays also the victory of the rights in Italy here a role). 
One gets the impression, as would have the old elite, its parties, its programs, but also hers advised, periodicals, intellectual creditor, many one would say its format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value regarding its, what goes nowadays in the lower social layers of the west before itself and yet reinforces by the finance crisis, and up to the Überdimensionalität driven becomes. 
In view of all its it simply would be exaggerated to speak about a "rebellion of the measures". 
To hold the eyes however far open it is not certain meanwhile.
