Obama – the first anti American president? Here an explanation 
A well known American politician whom much lies on that, when independent looked at to become, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti American president. 
The first was maintained Jimmy Carter, that through its decisions, the economy of the USA decimated and that with the been hostile Islam relations (and this yet today as a private man does)". 
The attacks against Obama become more and more more violent, just now that the choices approach. 
A lady out of Miami wrote in a webpage: "This person is full ambitions. 
Obama is very impudent: it thinks is received it the highest office of a nation, seen the altogether two black governors and five black senators hat!". 
Have actually these attacks not concerns answer however much to say; it racist attacks and it not the question of the voter: he will be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; everyone says that Obama will win with a large advantage. 
Also in this case, people are not there, that with the heart and with the head speak. 
A newspaper out of Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its in the Editorial: not until the choice cabin we will know well, whom the real American patriot will give its voice. 
Here a mentality of the USA comes to the light, that was held to last hidden. 
"Says, what you want, we will decide, for whom we will make our Kreuchen, whether for Obama or for McCain". 
People are swear there, that: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America. 
Something, what one before never heard – first now that the success of the black candidate so certainly seems. 
On all cases, in spite of all these considerations, the final weapon for the democrats is George Bush. 
1500 persons were questioned: Which mistakes did Bush commit during its tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq. 
America changes. 
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent with a step in the rear again home. 
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost its life and were not forced the Americans to pack. 
Nevertheless, Iraq remains the weak point of Bush for the majority. 
That that will take in its place stands before a gigantic task.
