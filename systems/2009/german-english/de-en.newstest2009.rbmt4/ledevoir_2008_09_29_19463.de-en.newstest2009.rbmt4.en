The prime minister does not exclude to initiate choices before end of the year. 
As soon as the general meeting of the liberal party was over, Jean Charest proceeded yesterday after Jean Talon in Quebec where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be selected in the current part choice. 
`Den course of our last large boundary in the north shift' : This is the long-term goal, that introduced Jean Charest yesterday with visual means in the general meeting of the liberal party of Quebec in Levis, whereby it entirely the guidelines folgte. 
During its presentation, a type picture mill was projected behind it. 
On three gigantic screens, spectacular pictures of water power plants, mines revolved observes, of Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc. 
Large means such as during the choice period. 
Opposite of the press refused the prime minister by the way, to exclude that he will hold off the choices this autumn, also if he let be reported, that appointment calendars be would be very full. 
The `Plan north' the fourth element of a `Vision is', that the prime minister has nominally for Quebec, namely that of a `neuen economic region', that plans a unification with France regarding labor forces, an agreement between Canada and Europe and unifications with Ontario. 
Although it was mentioned recently frequently in the speeches of the prime minister, the opening of the north - the northern zone on the 49sten latitude - never subject of a presentation had been. 
To explain the prime minister restricted themselves however on that why the north would be `ein jewel with enormous potential', no date, no investment sums or exact priorities named however for the coming projects. 
At most some outlooks on that on what more could be worked: Above all at the water energy, at the forest, but especially at the mining sector, favors through the growth of the threshold countries and the renewal of the public infrastructures. 
The list according to Mr. Charests the north possesses `Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'. 
This `Gebiet twice so largely like France' `ist in our vicinity, is in Quebec. 
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', emphasized it to show like around clearly that it seeks to realize a national founder dream. 
Quebec grew very through its connection with the north, emphasized it: the street to the gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James bay. 
`Es belongs to us, it is our future', joined it thereto after it had inserted a theatrical recess in order to observe the gigantic card behind itself. 
The north, 70% of the zone of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador with, the Quebec already always called for, explained the prime minister vis-à-vis the press. 
`Dies is a traditional bearing that all governments pursued. 
It gives a borderline, at which it gives since very long time no unification, if itself the opportunity become I offers this bearing in the name the government again take in', explained it. 
We newly must consider moreover, `mit the climate change our vision of the north', declared it and spoke over the north west passage, that will be passable based on the ice enamel the entire year. 
Before this new geopolitical background, the prime minister means that it would be quite a duty to occupy this zone. 
And the inhabitants of the zone, the native inhabitants and the Inuit? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would go around very carefully with them, and that they would profit from this project, above all the boys. 
Two former ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pekistischer delegate of Ungava) initiated already consultations in about thirty partnerships. 
A minister committee led by Benoît peel animal, in which Julie Boulet (carrier and mineral resources) takes in an important place, received the works. 
The prime minister does not exclude create becomes himself a large meeting, `nicht unconditionally a summit', but an opportunity, in the `man a joint vision'. 
The development of the north will proceed in the remaining in agreement with the principles of the persistent development. 
The plan north becomes `besprochen, regulated and be environmentally friendly', promised it. 
Jean Charest described this `Vision' as if it would be a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers, that were before it in the office. 
`Wie the liberals, that were before us in the office, rethink we in order to change the challenges into new growths and Entwicklungschanchen. 
This was by the way one of the subjects turned-up again and again of the weekend that was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the acceptance the party leadership by Jean Lesage. 
One of the supposed decisions plans to rename the power plant of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-obstruction dam. 
`Von Godbout that Hydro Quebec created, over Lesage, that the quiet revolution and the nationalization of the water electricity reached, to Bourassa, that the James bay made to determine knew our party always, the future', explained Jean Charest. 
Vis-à-vis the press it made reference to another, this time conservative intention, and to be sure on the program `Roads to the North' of John Diefenbaker, prime minister of 1957 until 1963. 
With regard to the project water power obstruction dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, emphasizes Mr. Charest, that would be planned its starting for 2012. 
`Das remains under us, but I have before, at the same time to its', trusted it its party members on, what evoked in those approval storms. 
The prime minister who said in April, that it would give 2008, and certainly also 2009, no choices, did not exclude in the deed the possibility to hold off this autumn a choice, what is possible it of the law here, yet. 
It emphasizes that its appointment calendar is full however, above all because of a mission of the partnership advice in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. 
The general meeting of the weekend provided the liberal party chief a platform out of nationalistic plans, above all out of `die constitution relevant goals', that were supposed readily: The PLQ demands very especially the recognition of the `Besonderheit of Quebec' in the constitution. 
It would like also that Quebec of members of the advice appoints the Canadian broadcast and telecommunications, and that these possess a veto regarding that in Quebec gefällten decisions. 
Of sides of the opposition, the guidelines of the plan were received north with scepticism. 
The boss of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, got forth the politics to the development of the north-you-Quebec again, that the government Landry 2001 introduced. 
Loudly you have the liberal government when it came 2003 at the power, on that renounced to use this. 
If it had done it, `wären we today already much further', judged woman Marois at the side of its candidate in Jean Talon (where the choice today takes place) Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ expressed itself for that to support the acceptance of a plan north through the government. 
`Aber what we want, is, becomes that this not only a large presentation', declared of the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, that returns today out of the vacation.
