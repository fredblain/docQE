Duel on knife cutting edge: MP3-Player against mobile phone. 
We advise you in your choice 
While almost each mobile phone MP3-Dateien can play back, yet no MP3-Player can telephone. 
Therefore it looks naturally so that it is better to buy itself only a telephone. 
In spite of everything, there are sufficient reasons why one should gain himself an independent Player. 
The choice depends entirely the future owner on the type of the utilization and the claims. 
Certainly one buys himself hardly for at home a crazy expensive turntable in order to sound on that the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from qualitative point of view there is also no objective reason for that. 
If have however LPs with type skirt, jazz or blues on the shelf, dream probably at least of one. 
So that is expressed also with the music on trips, therefore with compressed music, simplified - music in the MP3-Format. 
Also here there are price categories and quality categories. 
For the one, it is will bear perhaps not acceptable to issue for a Player eight thousand crowns, just as however a Pink-Floyd-fan probably hardly headphones for twenty crowns of the market. 
Two extreme between which it gives for every sufficient room. 
The selection extend is diversified. 
Also the service life of the batteries is decisively. 
Some good Music Players can play back much more than only music, but that what mobile phones can, they do not create once in outline. 
No modern device is to be used so universal like the telephone. 
Next to the primary functions, that telephoning and the shelf, it can represent music and videos, both receive, it has once a better, once a worse camera and can navigate perhaps also. 
And if one includes yet the Smartphons and Kommunikatoren, one has almost a small computer in the pocket. 
It is a small miracle, for no refrigerator can grill and can photograph no television. 
Yet the universality of the mobile phones entails also disadvantages. 
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more frequent you will have to load it however. 
And the playing back of music is one of the largest energy gluttons. 
Only a few mobile phones can play back music more long than a ten twelve hours, mostly is it much fewer. 
In this regard, Music Players (special the simplest) are clearly more efficient. 
Therefore you should calculate in the cheap mobile phones therewith that they cannot play back more long music than a couple of hours. 
If you telephone then off and at yet, buy yourself to the security rather another charger for the office - that applies also to more expensive devices. 
In MP3-Playern, you will not have this problem, also that less good at least 9 hours hold uninterrupted business suddenly loading from. 
A further problem exists then if one wants to record the music on the mobile phone. 
Unfortunately only a slight part of the devices controls an USB conclusion, moreover each mobile phone cannot be connected without special software directly to a PC. 
Naturally one can record will be used the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card harvest devices without reduction with the tiny storage cards finished, that in mobile phone. 
In Players, you require up to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
They need to line the device only over USB PORT with music out of your PC. 
Most mobile phones and Player design even a music library, organized after the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or for example the estimation through user. 
Some devices portray only the tree structure of the Adressverzeichnisses, similar to the windows explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephones with operating system). 
Players are to be served more easily, mobile phones can more 
In the selection of a concrete device, you should inquire especially about the service life of the rechargeable battery, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and naturally also the serve comfort. 
Music is for you above all scenery and hear it every day only shortly for example in the streetcar, passes an any mobile phone, that plays back MP3-Dateien. 
What can really already almost each mobile phone. 
They also not particularly must control, which music formats can process a mobile phone or a Player. 
MP3 create will be everyone, and most music that you get, straight in this format. 
The format belonged to spread can play back that most, and moreover most devices also music in the WMA format. 
Less AAC (a format, the Apple and its iPods use) is usual. 
Better mobile phones enable also the purchase of music Online. 
One needs to call only the corresponding sides of a provider (or another supplier) over Internet mobile, and one already can acquire a song or album. 
This service can already on and for itself a striking argument be why one should gain himself a music mobile phone. 
Unfortunately the offer of the provider is bad and is restricted mostly only to fast radio hits. 
The prices are not also the lowest. 
Generally however one assumes that straight this type of the sale of music (would be it over GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in the future will control the music industry. 
That carry the mobile phone with itself. 
If you have desire to sound somewhat, grasp forget lies after the mobile phone in the jacket pocket, during the Players at home. 
It depends however whether you carry also always headphones or at least a wireless absolve arrangement with itself. 
If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker, control almost each mobile phone that, but only the least MP3-Player. 
The probably largest advantage of the music mobile phones will lie for many in the price. 
The cheapest cost normally less than three thousand crowns. 
For three and four thousand crowns, you get already an entirely respectable Walkman. 
The largest Handicap will be for that that no normal headphones are there. 
The best and technically most matured telephones with a 3,5-mm-Öffnung for normal headphones cost up to five ten thousand crowns. 
The advantage of the Players lies again in the easy operation. 
The simplest - and unconditionally cheapest (see selection) - Player everyone cannot serve really. 
A minimum at functions, the resemblance in the operation with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or for example the turntable is obvious. 
It threatens no collision in form of an erroneously engaged mobile Internet and a subsequently horrendous calculation for data transmissions. 
After which device one should grasp now 
Also the cheapest mobile phones (for example Vodafone 527) control as a rule a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD and ä.). 
Also if you buy later a corresponding card, two thousand crowns suffice. 
Yet attention. 
In the basis models, as a rule only cards with a maximal capacity of 2 GB are supported. 
Only the most expensive can read also 8-GB-Speicherkarten 8-GB-Speicherkarten 8-GB-Speicherkarten 8-GB-Speicherkarten 8-GB-Speicherkarten. 
If you want to possess already a mobile phone and want to buy yourself another low-priced MP3-Player, grasp you after Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't have to put then more than 1100 crowns on the table. 
If belong to the more demanding listeners, take dear specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent serve buttons for MP3, and the serve comfort comes so at that of a single MP3-Players up to. 
Furthest Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones have out of the series Walkman the same user interface like the individually sold MP3-Player, is here. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long rechargeable battery service life (normally 15 hours, maximally up to 35 hours) MP3-Player of the manufacturer named above perform you.
