The Sudetens demanded of the USA a referendum 
The Sudeten German had requested in 1945 around the incorporation of the Böhmerwaldes at the United States. 
This follows out of a letter, that stores in the collections of the south bohemian scientific library. 
If we cannot be component of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America. 
With such a wish, 1945 should have turned some groups of Sudeten German to the US president. 
This follows among other things out of a letter, that is been preserved in a private archive and that is stored today in the collections of the south bohemian scientific library. 
The German of Krumau asks the American president in the letter, he should not permit the return of the "Sudetengaus" - that on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler taken in became - at Czechoslovakia. 
"We have the situation correctly understood and want us actual the words be certain, that the American units not as an oppressor and enemies German territory enter, but rather as a deliverer", is named it in a letter, that with the words "persons whom the fate of the Sudetens is lies" signs at the heart. 
Because the connection lets assume the Sudeten German - in knowledge of the Czech national character - at Czechoslovakia, that they would expect brutality, inconsiderateness, the lack of understanding, suppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to receive for today and forever the protection domination over the Böhmerwald. 
"We cannot believe, that you without consideration on the view of a quarter million inhabitant this zone a country strange for us communicate, that minority suppresses and to remove tried and purely nothing at all to the victory of the allies contributed has", is to be read in the letter. 
The reason why the authors cannot sign, is alleged the fear of Rachegelüsten of the "Czech oppressors". 
If the US president doubt about of the attitude of the Böhmerwalddeutschen would cultivate, let it be sufficiently if it would initiate in the Böhmerwaldgau a referendum about that, whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or wanted to live under the protection domination of the United States. 
Although the text of the letter somewhat naively likes to sound in current knowledge of the postwar story, it draws however in the opinion of some time witnesses a good picture with respect to the at that time expectations of the Sudeten German. 
Also if the bohemian German at least had to suspect, that one would negotiate over its deportation out of the republic, vouched itself only few of them such a possibility generally. 
Some waited that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate for the Sudetens a type autonomy. 
Again others believed, they could remain simple in Czechoslovakia. 
Also the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa that comes from Budweis confirms that. 
It was used in the war as a Budweiser German in the navy at the Baltic Sea. 
When it came at the end of the war into British captivity and one brought it into a war prison camp to Holstein, dozens of German further bohemian to it came, it should teach them Czech. 
"You believed, if it would come home, would become them the Czech too would fit come", so Chalupa. 
No one the German war prisoners, who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, calculated according to its opinion therewith that one would banish it on the basis of the Beneš-decrees out of the republic.
