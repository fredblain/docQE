The pride and the strain in life of the black population, in a city of the entirely special type 
Hides between the outgrowths of the leisure time parks in the vicinity of Orlando, few miles of the glittering, loud and gigantic driving removes, lies a quiet city in which the pride and the complication of the Afro American culture to the light come. 
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home town Zora Neale Hurstons, is to be described did no longer so simply like Hurston it in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." 
Nowadays it is a pilgrim site. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby de are to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville come to remember around the most famous author of the Harlem renaissance. 
And nevertheless the city, that is and remains describes it – and that it to a tourist excursion goal made, in that it it in the Floridas guide included, that at present the depression of the federal author project produces became – in many regard a place of the entirely special sort. 
Eatonville is not so independent, solid and privately like in the 1930ern when Hurston wrote, that rural black communities in Florida often refused to divide its true thoughts with the white man, that knows "so few over us, that he knows what it entgeht." 
Even nowadays, in a year in that a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, to an open discussion about race ratios calls, are tired of it many here further to be observed of outsiders. 
"We very on that are considered like our story told becomes", so Hortense Jones, 59, from birth an inhabitant of the city and parishioner of the oldest church of the city. 
It must agree." 
Eatonville became long time as paradoxical the triumph and the battle defined. 
It is both is twice as high a historic example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, in that the poverty quota like the national average. 
It is on the one hand a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example of that - sometimes convicted, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south that has its roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprisingly that inhabitants are here both proud and on the hat. 
And so correctly the objections began it around Eatonville's image actually with Zora how here all Hurston name. 
It placed the world its home town in books before, that came of hearts and were written in dialect, so like "paint and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) 
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide of changed the city, that lies entirely near the route 77, a street that through the often forgotten center Floridas leads, to the scenes of black story and human drama. 
Impudent like Oskar both in the actual life and in the literature, Hurston reader led mayor, Joe Clarke, first to the store by Eatonvilles and turned then more private matters to. 
"To one side of the street to the left", wrote it, "is that brown -knows painted modern school, with its cultivated gardens and playgrounds, around which itself always Howard Miller worries, although it do hardly read and write kann." 
It mentioned also the new man of widow Dash and wrote that lee Glenn "drinks of each type sells and what-also-always to hour rooms passt." 
In only few hundred words Hurston connected therefore Eatonville with even government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was very certainly no guide. 
In the deed, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all. 
"Zora described the things so, how it were", so the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the maggots the Hurston immortalized in that it the men quoted, who sang songs over that its beauty, that were full sexual allusion. 
It added: "Many people disliked this." 
One remembers here still Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin, that regularly returned, after its family was pulled to Jacksonville, Florida. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that if Hurston came into the city gebraust, it this usually without warning did, clothes in a making noise Chevrolet, smoking and with pairs of pants, imagines that in a city even today something on its venerable clothing style. 
According to Mr. Franklin, most inhabitants were fascinated whereas many of they despised. 
"The people were always happily Zora to see", said Mr Franklin. 
But "it remained too long", it never joined swung thereto during it in its chair, on a terrace lain to the rear, that looks at the Sabelia lake, in which Hurston was baptized according to all probability. 
As Hurston in 1960 died was it poor and its books assaulted. 
Together with the large part of the world, Eatonville seemed forgotten it to have. 
Although she was once a famous author, a time comrade Langstin Hughes and the single black woman at the bar Ard College in the 1920ern, was buried it in fort Pierce, Florida where she lived, in an anonymous grave. 
In Eatonville, there was no large commemorative celebration, no public reading on a large scale. 
"I think, that it its contribution in the world or its heir in the slightest understood have", so Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography over Hurston the 2003 published became not. 
The turning point came in the '80's. 
County authorities orange wanted to put a fünfspurige freeway through the city in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow zweispurige main street of the community. 
Orlandos suburbs had pressed already the freeway 4 through the western outskirts. 
The suggestion became submits when Eatonville recovered yet always of a difficult phase in its story. 
Compulsion integration, among other things, had set the relatively idyllic isolation of the community an end. 
In the '50's the battle against race mixture hate brought into the partnership. 
"In this time came often a pile of white boys and it threw orange and thing on that to one side of sitting people", said Mr. Franklin. 
"There was killed became even once a woman that at the same time. 
They threw a water melon out of the car." 
In 1955, Hurston examined in one write to the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the waiter court to force integration in that it designated its decision in the case Brown against the schools inspector as "insulting instead of my race respecting". 
Inhabitants say nowadays that although the lifting of the race separation in many a regard was positive, it that the group consistency in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth weakened. 
"Black children were it accustoms, embraced to become - I remind one me on that - one embraced its teacher of the morning and one embraced its teacher in the evening", so N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the public-spirited group to the protection of the Eatonville partnership. 
That uprightly could be received so long, joined it thereto until teacher and student came no longer out of the same place. 
"One embraced its white teacher not, for he was a white teacher - I my there is a cultural crevice available", said woman Nathiri. 
However the civil rights contributed in addition that place was created for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actor and artist who disregarded prejudices, so how it did it, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How someone can deny herself the joy of my company! 
I do not understand it." 
In 1975, the author got going grave of nameless Alice Walker to Hurstons and began to fight for the revitalization of its renown. 
A much praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway in the bookshelves later was to be found five years, and it made again to a part of the American literature canon. 
The distance street project came exactly at one time, in which Eatonvilles stood most famous daughter again once in the light of the public. 
Hurstons saw and this time old neighbors it as a rescuer. 
The community began to show festivals in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston over what the district with the building of the freeway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the Eröffnungsevent two years later, and many turn every January for the celebration back. 
A few years later the district of its street blueprints turned away itself. 
"The plans of a fünfspurigen distance street of animated the city, accelerated the entire with top speed, woke real citizen pride", said woman Nathiri. 
Woman Boyd expressed it somewhat more simply: "Zora rescued Eatonville." 
The victory against the distance street project contributed to a variation of the even picture of the city. 
Came began more and more train trip, so like avenge yard Munson, a lawyer, that has gone since 1993 here into the church, and domestic to appreciate the past newly. 
Eatonville was included 1998 in the nationwide historic index. 
A new single-story library (naturally after Hurston named) opened in 2006 on the new paved and brightened up Kennedy Boulevard. 
Nowadays Eatonville is as always a peculiarity in Florida: she can feel established became herself only 6 miles of the city center Orlandos sometimes like a rear lane in the summer rain, so small like at that time as it by only 27 black families in the 1880ern. 
(You is nowadays to 90% black). 
Outside in search of the story Eatonvilles and its meaning are treated often still with caution. 
For most interviews, a permission in the forefield is not may be photographed necessary and certain things - so like the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles of oldest church, that of a white painted became and black men in the field work represents -. 
Many in Eatonville, like woman Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a predeliction for dark red, fear still that its shielded partnership is misunderstood. 
And nevertheless, to the same time to that the Hurston festival larger became, was born also an increased degree at homeland pride. 
Above all young persons tend saw in addition to see Eatonville so like Hurston its total race: beautifully, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proudly, creatively and diligently, foolishly and mixes through like each other race group and people group in America. 
It is hear can the honest love to this city that one in the voice of Mr. Franklins nephew, utilize could the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, that to return has before after the College after Eatonville, in order to work in the city administration or at the police, that loud it something aid. 
And even the boys, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins out of winter park, learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"Most people who pass through only here, will think: "Alas, this city is nothing in comparison with all the other", said Alondra Kenon recently at a Sunday after the church. 
"But if one actually stops and a moment long its story observes, is it a very beautiful city."
