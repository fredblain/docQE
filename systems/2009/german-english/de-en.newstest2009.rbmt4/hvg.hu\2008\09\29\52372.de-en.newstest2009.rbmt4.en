What became produced into the calculation factory of extra charge &amp; Co.? 
On the 8th of October, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János extra charge and its accomplices begin. 
Especially the participation in the organized crime is reproached the accused, as well as coarsely careless damage and business fraud, and other punishable offenses - among other things document forgery -. 
According to district attorney's office, that were used out of the announcements lukrierten means for own purposes, attained covers became achievements during that often with falsified calculations. 
National moneys and subsidies of the autonomy - altogether HOOVES 65 Mio - are supposed to have flowed partly into the cash registers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private cash registers more single. 
How the issuing authorities announced, fictional calculations were produced in the relating of the announcement moneys, and the societies not also are supposed to be come later its duties. 
According to accusation writing, a large part of the calculations should have been falsified. 
The calculation blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, one let prepare the round seals in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision about that, on which firms the calculations are supposed to be issued, was decided on that round trip north of the disk lake, on which István Lados was sent by János extra charge. 
In the train of this "reconnaissance tour", Lados pension and restaurants foundly should make. 
It demanded calculations over the Konsumationen in order to be able to issue later on these models being based calculations for the youth ministry and sport ministry, that socially and Department of Labor, as well as the autonomy of Budapest. 
These calculations should have been manipulated by a majority by István Lados and its accomplice, András whereby more latter after our information for the constitution of the corresponding reports been responsible be should. 
One of the goals of Lados' "reconnaissance tour" was a beer local. 
How two of extra charge and Co in 2003 issued calculations is to be taken, the gastronomy business should have the ninety headed group of the society Biztos Pont Egyesület bewirtet. 
Now the boss of the business does not give away locally would have fit however on, a so large group all at once in that. 
Another calculation, issued in the summer 2002 on the foundation Jobb later well known as an Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, showed also serious form mistakes and contents mistakes. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, that controls solely three rooms and not simultaneously can harbor more than ten persons, should have stayed according to calculation of 130 guests. 
The imagination of the calculation counterfeiter no boundaries were set obviously just as when it concerned the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy business in whose accounting documents of the customers seem up Jobb and Hoppá according to accusation authority not at all first. 
How manager Farkas of the hvg. hu announced, was immediately clearly that it concerned falsified documents, to it when it by the district attorney's office during an inquiry documents were produced. 
"Our firm name and the tax number incorrectly were mounted" on the stamp. 
And further: Apart from irregularities, also the fact was incorrectly that the business one hundred persons should have harbored, after they have altogether eleven rooms, that offer place to impossibly so many persons. 
Also provisions had been on the calculation cited, would be there the restaurant for some time time no longer in operation. 
The busy calculation counterfeiters neglected also, to review that the Budapester travel agency taken by them into the visor offers excluding trips abroad, and so they indicated Hungary trips on the bar payment calculation, what contradicted the Rechnungslegungspraxis of the firm also. 
How in the course of the ascertainments well known became, they cited in addition on the calculations also the value-added tax although travel agency achievements, that have references to a country outside of the EU, are, value-addedtax-free. 
The height of the value-added tax was altogether on four of the hotel Révfülöp Kft. at the foundation Jobb issued calculations incorrect because the business reckons instead of 25 only 15 percent sales tax, moreover become of the colleagues exclusively machine calculations issued, the falsified documents were however handwritten. 
A further mistake, that was slip in the "Rechnungslegern", was that, that it in a case "its carrier" than attained achievement indicated had although this is not offered by the firm specialized on Investmentberatung, divided the district attorney's office with. 
Further irregularities - incorrect calculation format, incorrect stamp - was to be owed that that at Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as at XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont issued calculations as a forgery exposed become could. 
Just as in the case the Ravenna Bt. and the sport warehouse Kunfehértó whose managers assured to never to have issued the calculations. 
Another "mistake" is the counterfeiters in that HAD Kft. out of Nyíregyháza slip in: This company was at present (2001) namely just in solution when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület should have eaten there - the mass administrator gave consequently on to not to have issued the calculations themselves. 
Deliberately falsified 
Persons who was thoroughly aware are the other group of the Rechnungsleger, that they would have to put fictional calculations. 
On requesting of the Fiatal Baloldal - the foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány calculations issued Ifjú Szocialisták for the foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, in a height of about HOOVES 4 million. 
According to accusation writing, the manager of the Collab Kft was persuaded. of one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to the display of the fictional calculations. 
The Biogate Kft present momentarily also in liquidation. should have collaborated also with extra charge and Co. : In 2003, the gmbh should have furnished the foundation Jobb Alapítvány, as well as the societies Atlasz Egyesület and Egyesület with falsified calculations in the total value of HOOVES 5 million, attained related itself that on not achievements. 
There was however just as little payment traffic because the calculations were cancelled directly after its display, what the concerned in its documents to note forgotten have however. 
The third group of the Rechnungsleger comprises persons who are connected directly with the accused. 
Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trió Kft., one in Budapest of resident is one of them, there however not detectable fuel firm and vehicle trade firm. 
This firm should have issued several calculations in the period from October to December 2005 over the sale of EDP components in the total value of HOOVES about 18 million. 
According to issuing authority, the cash present since the 14th of September 2005 in liquidation Investment Kft should have functioned. out of Kiskunhalas as a buyer of these calculations. 
Manager of this firm was a Rumanian, whom the firm documents should be delivered also by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. 
After our information, Kubatov stood during the ascertainments, issued calculations in the name of the gmbh. at the societies Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as at Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected its value itself. 
The firms Fa Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos Investment Bt. should have been established by Romanian masons on Iván Kubatovs specific wish there. 
In truth however was no these firms active, what lay according to accused at lacking orders. 
Nevertheless it was able to profit from the businesses: On requesting of its accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, that was delegated with the preparation of the firm foundation documents, he issued in the name of the firms calculations at the societies brought with extra charge in connection, like about at Atlasz and Y Generáció. 
Altogether Kubatov should have issued 15 calculations in the total value of HOOVES 14.2 million in the name of the firms cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade at the organizations. 
The district attorney's office assumes that Kubatov of respectively 10% the calculation sum as well as the value-added tax could have collected. 
Kubatov should have abused even the firm Szi Beri Bt. for the display of fictional calculations - in this case were enclosed the calculations the applications of Biztos Pont. 
The firm Y Generáció and Szövetség a in a modern manner Magyarországért in January 2006 delivered its application in the public-spirited organization of the socialistic party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA"). 
Both received 500,000 Forint apiece, utilized these sums however purpose alienated. 
In order to gloss over this, they have cause produced the TMA five fictional calculations of that team Kft.. 
These calculations were guaranteed by the way in the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the instruction ministry. 
In the negotiations becomes now of some accused with an admission over the procedure of the calculation forgery how they were discarded already before the district attorney's office, calculated. 
A sensation could be if the head accusation János extra charge to a comprehensive admission decides. 
Its previous statements were detailed namely fewer, and although it had accepted already repeatedly to report comprehensively over all, stands its admission yet from. 
The question remains therefore openly whether this lies in its interest, whether the socialists locked a pact with it regarding the reparation of the large part of the emerged damage of HOOVES 50 million, and whether extra charge is in return ready to accept the responsibility. 
It is however thoroughly possible that extra charge plays now the "insulted", after its petitions on mitigation of the arrest and house arrest were bumped into deaf ears. 
During other criminal, that caused major damage with economy offense far and did not compensate this, stand at liberty, or at least under house arrest, remains forbids extra charge this possibility.
