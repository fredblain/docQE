Free opinion - the orwellsche speech of Barrick gold 
In its edition of the 17th of September, Le Devoir published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice general director of the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. 
This confirms, and an orwellsche logic pursues strove for, with the goal, to open at the same time, that the largest gold winning company of the world a slander complaint over six million against three authors and a small destitute publishing house a `öffentliche transparent debate'. 
If it agrees, that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge over the truth, above all not in the case of slander complaints, but rather over the law. 
How expects, this basic difference was concealed of Mr. Garver totally. 
For for Barrick gold, the best type is to be led a public debate to drive every into the ruin, that ventures it to represented one of that its opposed opinions. 
Very same, how the process goes out, the authors and the publisher of the beech Noir Canada considerable sums will have to issue in order to prepare its defense and to fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers, that are paid out of the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. 
The tactic in these unequal fights is in the remaining often to ruin the defenders, in order to force an amicable regulation, that makes the opposite side mouth dead and deters moreover everyone, that it ventures to concern itself again with the question. 
If Barrick gold wanted really a public debate, it should have presented its visibility of the things before the public opinion. 
In contrast to that, what in many of the countries, in which Barrick gold works, perfectly acceptable is, debates become not in Canada normally through the exchange of ideas and through club blows expedited. 
It would have sufficed therefore if the gold mine would have disclosed its books and acts and would have opened an actual debate, through which newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams, that would have been able to bring light into this question. 
But Barrick gold seems to have no confidence into the public opinion and wipes the petition and letters to the support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement aside. 
Could Mr. Garver explain perhaps how he can ask simultaneously for a `öffentliche' debate and at the same time yet the opinions neglect just this public? 
Apparently comprised this word in the world of the vice president only the generously paid lawyers, and not the partnership of all Canadian; an entirely quite cramped visibility manner of the concept. 
In a democracy, even Verleumder are right the to speak. 
What - or not not understand wants - is understands Barrick gold, that the public, that the authors and publisher of Noir Canada supports, does, this above all therefore, because it rejects the brutal bearing of the gold mine. 
This public is not civilized perceive arranged in addition ready to listen and to judge Barrick, but on the basis one exchange of arguments, and in a frame, that many as a gag complaint (in the course of the `öffentlichen debate' Barrick gold just a demand on the authors of Noir Canada, in whom it demands by them to use this concept no longer. ..). 
Apart from the surrealen speech of Mr. Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct attack on the freedom to the academic research and the establishment of the truth that are basic for each democratic society. 
It denies totally the right to quote plausible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, that form the basis of the intellectual work. 
Is if it impossible in a country such as Canada not please to investigate and to discuss subjects, that the rich businesses of this world, can do who otherwise that then? 
If Barrick gold wanted really a public and transparent debate, it could lead this in that it follows the scientific standards, that were used by the authors of Noir Canada. 
It is right a to answer. 
The university background to which we belong, knows for some time to get debates and inconsistencies into the handle and to solve conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold shows clearly that it has, in contrast to that, what purports it, no desire on a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the university world just as for the public debate, and it time becomes that the governments seize measures, that restrict this type of unjustified complaints.
