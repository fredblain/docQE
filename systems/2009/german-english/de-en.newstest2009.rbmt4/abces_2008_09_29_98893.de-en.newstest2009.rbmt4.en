`Sangre de mayo' : Hero book of Garci 
Inspires of `Episodios Nacionales' of Benito Pérez Galdós, places José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the Frenchmen there. That is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with approximately 15 million Euro investment for the filming. 
In this manner the Cineast tried to represent `eine quantity of personalities and social analysis', what it had admired always at the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long index of the performer. 
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, is presented this Friday in movie theaters and shown later on the transmitter Telemadrid than a four hour mini series. 
José Luis Garci, large fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this filming its `Kindheitstraum went' in fulfillment. It has this Esperanza Aguirre to owe, that delegated it three years ago of the autonomous partnership Madrid, to turn a commemorative film to the second century celebration on the 2nd of November in Madrid. Above all, because the story is based on the base of `Episodios Nacionales', that supposed the order. 
The total contribution of 15 million, that by the autonomous partnership Madrid was placed for filming, offers brought become was to be represented Garci how it added, the `einmalige possibility' with the help of decoration and corresponding garments the picture of the `verwirrten Spain, which chose the incorrect leader for the battle, because the people by the battle for the independence and under the domination the Ferdinands of the VII in residue'. 
However the Cineast regrets that one was not able to reckon with the financing such as in `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice so highly as in `Sangre de mayo'), therefore some scenes could not be turned out of the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci collaborated almost its entire career. 
For this reason, has Garci, that also film director in `Volver a empezar was', through its usual mode of operation co-operated: he stood first rehearse must on the stage to the actors, with which one before one to turn begins and for that, that had made no Casting, appear he `demütigend' and respect providing to perform `ein part of the occupation of the film director exists therein, aid in the theater and in the movie theater What in the movie theater industry, in which one works, geschieht.' 
Many performers, on whom he knocks mayo in `Sangre de', must repeat before its camera, like in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he one won has), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates, that represent this year Spain before the Academy of Hollywood, represents, a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Neither `Sangre de mayo', yet `Siete mesas de billar francés' and in the end also not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'. 
For this film, Garci expects no honors. 
You believe `Am beginning that you work for the descendants, later notice you that it is only for the development, and now you are has satisfied, if one another film produced', explain Garci after more than 30 years occupation activity.
