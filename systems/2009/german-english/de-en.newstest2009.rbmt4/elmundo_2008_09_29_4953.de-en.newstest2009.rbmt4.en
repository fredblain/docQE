Speak in the sleep 
Some children speak at night 
I my not that, that wake up and tell us at the same time something, what happened at the day before that, but rather the children who speak during the sleep. 
If it happens you for the first time, in the best case will be frightened has it, but in the reality that no meaning. 
That is a positive insomnia that is named the speaking in the sleep. 
It is spread rather, above all at the children and youth. 
Certainly, became more than one of you told that its at night spoken has. 
This phenomenon occasionally can appear (a time in life, for example, like during the high fever), or regularly (every day, a time per week, a time in the month), at the next day the child can remember nothing. 
There is no single reason that this appearance causes. 
Often are sought connections with other appearances in the sleep, gives like nightmares, panic-stricken anxiety at night, Enuresis noctura (bed wetnesses at night), speaking in the sleep sought, but it no reason for that. 
How we already earlier mentioned it, it can lie at very high fiber, stress situations or overstrain. 
In any case, that is a little investigated phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it appears is very variable. 
It can be that one speaks quietly in single words, whispers or can be it entire an opposite (screams, wines, long discussions). 
In the cases if the remark is very intensive, is recommended to observe the child and to let advised itself at a specialist, in order to review whether a problem exists, which anxiety causes and comes in this manner into being. 
We said that it is a positive interference, therefore it is not treated, would be it, it is with another insomnia connected, that can become treated (for example, with the sleep Apnoe or with the stress). 
Carry out what one is make can, a series of simple prevention measures: 
Do not try to excite the child before the sleep. 
Choose therefore, quiet games for the child and avoid stressful television programs, that are terrible and somewhat too wild. 
At the nervous children, whom relaxations are recommended, relaxation methods can be used in order to help them, to got a certain internal quiet. 
That helps to sleep the child quietly. 
If the speaking in the sleep occurs once, to preserve tried the quiet. 
Thinks that it harmlessly is for the child and of the next day will be able to remember it nothing, what happened. 
Useful pieces of advice 
Do not rouse it. 
That is useless, for the child is unconscious, will tear it it out of the sleep. 
Although the child speaks, sleeps it, therefore rests it itself from. 
Keeps in mind if it appears after a couple of appearances frightened, is recommended to let or to find advised itself out, which reason has the child for the anxiety. 
If they understand, what says it (what so usually is), the child does not pressure not in order to carry out an interrogation and to get more information. 
So will be able to reach its therewith nothing because if the child sleeps, is do not think about can it unconscious and about that. 
Moreover, will hear it, will not know what says it, but you, would be, what dreams it and says why it that, therefore it careful with the interpretation of the information and the ends, that pulls its from that. 
Perhaps, it does not say that its that hear at night and know its secrets to the child. 
Not once as joke. 
That causes much anxiety. 
Therefore, makes is dredge you no worries, it nothing, is that a moment that lasts only a few minutes.
