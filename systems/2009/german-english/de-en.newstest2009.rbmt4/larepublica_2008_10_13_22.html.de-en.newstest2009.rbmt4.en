If the energy springs out of the waves, the large run suddenly up 
It is not one versiegende money source, which covers over 70% of the surface of the planet, and first now the large energy firms of the world seem to grasp this. 
Waves, currents and tide are look seek the new renewable energy sources at that now everyone, and to occupy also, about giant such as Chevron. 
The possibility to win energy out of the movements of the sea, is taken already for 70 years into consideration and examines intensified itself; not accidentally these studies since the first earth oil crisis considerably. 
As the price of the oil around 1980, vergas broke on press one the idea of the sea energy, now however the environment organizations and the increased oil price on new impulses in this sector. 
The world Energy Council (WEC) in London appreciates that 15% of the worldwide energy demand could be covered by the energies produced by the ocean waves. 
This would come the double of the energy produced momentarily by nuclear power plants same. 
Thereto yet the currents and tide would come moreover. 
Giant in the attack. 
The first firm, that sets now on the sea energy, is Enersis, that has signs in 2005 a contract to the erection of a power plant in the north of Portugal. 
As this message published became seemed to concern it a revolutionary step. 
Two years more and more firms are later it now out of the traditional energy industry, that set on the navy energy winning. 
"Chevron examined these technologies" – so the speaker of a business well known the US American giant in the Wall Street Journal – and ventures assist together the possibility from with us." 
It concerns herewith the procurement of an allowance of the American energy commission, that is necessary in order to start a project before the coast Alaskas. 
This is not a sign to be underestimated, v. a. if one considers, that just in Alaska further oil is promoted by the USA and President Bush started recently first the plans for new borings. 
Next to Chevron, also the firms are earned Power inc. from New York and Ocean Power out of New Jersey, that invest into the new industry; also the details are not well known, speak observer yet about an increasing interest. 
Yet improvement worthy technologies. 
Experts do not speak about a technology finding itself yet in the departure, this finally because yet the last doubts by sides of the conservationist are not clarified. 
Previously projects such as that in Portugal and also Scotland of rather small dimension are and seem to cause no seriously to be taken ecological problems. 
In order to produce however energy in large standard, it needs technologies with far larger influence on the environment. 
There are different possibilities: Ocean Power about uses a system of buoy connected together. 
The push of the waves, which low moves the buoy up and, is transformed within the swimmer over piston and cylinder into hydraulic pressure. 
This drives a turbine, which operates again a generator. 
The current is sent on that over lower water pipes to the coast. 
Until now, there is four planned plant of this type which wait only for the national permission. A part of the won energy could serve also for military arrangements. 
Power earned produces meanwhile already energy for an its department store and a Parklatz with the help of unterseeischer turbine in the East River of New York. 
The turbine drives the water movements during the tide, which feeds the generator through the emerging rotation. 
Loudly earned waits already a long snake of possible client to use on the necessary authorizations around these energy sources. 
First the waves, then the tide. 
A special interest earns according to the institute for current winning research immediately the potential which sticks in the tides. 
Although it concerns also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are yet better prediction cash as a wind currents, the sun irradiation and also the waves, and therefore a trustworthyer power source. 
Straight the tide energy is it, which states brought such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as further coast countries in addition, to invest already 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – for 2009 are planned already up to 35 million.
