Ask about the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal? 
The law does not know is not allowed it, in a distance coach the Umherlaufen 
In connection with the tragic accident of a penance of the company student Agency in the vicinity of the Italian Padua the question stands whether steward and traveler may run here during the trip in the bus there and. 
"Wanted we strictly and formally the law keep, contradicts the activity of a steward the law over the traffic", so the speaker of the transportation ministry Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, with which last week a twenty-two twenty-two year-old stewardess came around life, was caused probably of the driver of the truck, who crossed the bus the way. 
The young woman sat in this moment to all misfortune next to the driver, on that at the least certain place in the vehicle although she still had two further places to the decree. 
A bus can have or sharply brake an accident however also in the moment, expedites the steward coffee or newspapers in that. 
A roll plays also whether the bus is equipped according to the vehicle letter also with state places. 
If this is not planned in the bus, the travelers must sit. 
The distance coaches of student Agency have no state places; what the director confirmed vis-à-vis the firm, Radim. 
"This we discussed with the ministry, and this did not agree first the movement of traveler. 
Later one turned back this, and we arrived at a consent according to what the travelers may go during the trip on the toilet, if it its seat have", divided he its standpoint with. 
The law knows no steward 
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation for the roll of a steward - no legal specification describes this roll. 
There is to be sure also no legal specification that forbids it the carrier to furnish services. 
The law over the traffic knows only the term vehicle companion; its right and duties does not define it however", joins the speaker of the ministry Hanzelka unambiguously thereto. 
The director of the department of street vehicles the transportation ministry Josef Pokorný on the other hand means that the law retroactively uncovers this problematic nature. 
"It depends whether the bus has in the product allowance of also state places. 
That is then all", emphasizes it. 
Penance subdivide itself in city penance where there are state places and the maximum speed is restricted, local traffic penance with state places and a higher permitted speed and distance coaches without state places with the highest allowable speed and seats, that are equipped with security belts. 
How in the airplane, says the expert 
The BESIP expert for traffic security Jaroslav sees a penance in the movement of steward on board no basic problem. 
"In a fluid method many dangers, the situation do not threaten is comparable with the service on board an airplane. 
Also here is not certain when turbulences come, and the stewardess can the head knock itself." 
"A bus brakes however sharply, count naturally also the laws of the physics. 
Just as in the city bus or in a streetcar. 
The security of the steward must clarify the carrier through internal directions", says it and means also that this problematic nature is not solved from the viewpoint the law completely. 
is ready to paint the services 
Student Agency offers as the only bus firm services of steward. 
The firm busies about two hundred persons in this function. 
The director does not look at its occupation also after the accident as risk pregnant. 
"As soon as I get however the impression, that the occupation of the steward is risk pregnant, will paint I it. 
The travelers can receive coffee and newspapers in the getting into. 
That would sink also the costs", means it. 
As an interest in the security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin establishes the lack of steward in its penance. Its company operates compare to however only a fraction of lines in that student Agency. 
"We no stewardesses have defend us, on the other hand we already from the beginning. 
Earlier or later this ends with any deadly accident", had expressed it before not entirely for Týden. cz to a year. 
That was an incredible tragedy 
In the accident of a line penance to Naples, a young stewardess was perished out of the region Pilsen, that had worked two years for the company. 
The Slovenian truck was turned probably without blinking of the standing strip and had blocked the bus the trip. 
The driver of the penance tried to avoid through a sharp maneuver, collided however with the right front part with the truck. 
That the two places had been for the stewards sold, challenges. 
"These places cannot be reserved in distance connections, they are blockiert." 
Firm wants to accuse truck driver. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency will not wait for the judgement, expects a financial compensation it however also of sides of the indebted. 
A change in the law? 
Not in visibility 
A more exact regulation of the movement of steward on board a penance a legal regulation could bring, at which a thirty headed expert team of the transportation ministry works already over a year. 
"This to be sure arrived yet at no concrete end. 
Penance stand also not unconditionally on the order of the day, sooner the point system, the maximum speed on the freeway and the use of mobile phone in the trip", so expert. 
"The transportation ministry regards the activity of the steward not as something, that the security of the travelers substantially endanger could", so Hanzelka whereby the inspection of the security of the penance lies in the competence of the police and the labor safety authorities.
