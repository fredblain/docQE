<seg id="1"> Duel at knife-edge: MP3-Player against mobile phones. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> We advise you to your election </seg>
<seg id="3"> While nearly every mobile phones can play MP3-Dateien, still no MP3-Player can telephone. </seg>
<seg id="4"> So it is, of course, in such a way that it is better to buy only one telephone. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Despite this, there are plenty of reasons why we should add to its own player. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The choice is completely dependent on the nature of the use and the future owner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is certainly not buy at home for a mad expensive record player in order to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Once such musical novelties seem not to LP and qualitative because there is no objective reason for it. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But if you LP with kind have rock, jazz and Blues on the shelf, probably dream of at least one. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It is also the music on trips, with compressed music, simplified said, music in the MP3-Format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There are to price and quality categories. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is perhaps not acceptable to spend on a player eight thousand kroner but also a pink Floyd fan will hardly tolerate headphones for twenty crowns of the market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Two extremes, among whom there are enough to each area. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The choice is wide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The life of the batteries is crucial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some good Music players can play much more than music, but they do not even create what mobile phones can do suggestively. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern equipment to be used as universal as the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Besides the primary functions, telephone and that windscreen frame sections, can it music and video shows, both include, it has a better times a worse camera and could perhaps navigate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And if there is still the Smartphons and communicators, there is almost a small computer in the bag. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a small miracle because no refrigerator can photograph crickets and no television. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the universality of mobile phones will also bring disadvantages. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The benefits, will have the more you more functions you on your mobile phone but reload. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And playing music is one of the biggest Energiefresser. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Only a few mobile phones can play music more than ten twelve hours, mostly are much less. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this regard, Music players (special easiest) are much more efficient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> So you should count on the cheap mobile phones that they can not play more than a few hours of music. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you still telephone now and then, bought for security rather than a battery charger for the post - applies even more expensive equipment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> With MP3-Playern you will not tolerate the less good this problem at least 9 hours of continuous company with a trademark loading. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Another problem is when you want to overact music on the mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately, only a small part of the equipment has an USB conclusion, but each mobile phone without special software can not be directly linked to a PC. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Of course we can overact music directly on a storage medium, but few card readers will be finished with no reduction in the tiny memory cards, which are used in mobile phones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> With players, you do not need special software except for exemptions (iPod). </seg>
<seg id="33"> They need to feed the equipment only on USB haven with music from your PC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The most mobile phones and players even put on a music regulatorily library, according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the category or, for example, the assessment by users. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some equipment illustrate the tree structure of the list, such as the Windows Explorer, some can both (more iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Players are easier to use mobile phones can more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> With the selection of specific equipment, you should ask especially after the life span of accumulator, storage capacity, the quality and the type of noise and, of course, the control of comfort. </seg>
<seg id="38"> If music is above all façade for you, and if you hear it every day only briefly, for example in the tram, reaches a mobile phone, which plays MP3-Dateien. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What really knows almost every mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They do not have to control, especially, a mobile phone or a player who music formats can process. </seg>
<seg id="41"> MP3 create all, and most music that you get, will be especially this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format was one of the most common, and most devices also music in the WMA format can play. </seg>
<seg id="43"> AAC (a format that Apple use and iPods) is less than usual. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> More mobile phones are also the purchase of music for online. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One need only to call on mobiles Internet the pages of a provider (or another supplier), and already you can buy a song or an album. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This service can already be in itself a blatant argument for why we should add a music mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately, it is bad supply of providers and is usually only limited to move in quickly radio. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The prices are not even the lowest. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Generally, however, it is expected that this kind of sales of music (it is on Internet GSM, or wireless Internet) will control in the future the music industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Most of the mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="51"> If you want to listen to achieve a mobile phone in the jacket pocket, while the player is forgotten at home. </seg>
<seg id="52"> It depends on whether you always wearing headphones or at least a wireless free speech mechanism. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If not, you can use the integrated loudspeaker that almost every mobile phones, but only a few MP3-Player has. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Perhaps the biggest advantage of music mobile phones will be for many in the price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand crowns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> For three or four thousand kroner you have already quite decent Walkman. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The biggest handicap will be for most that no proper headphones are there. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The best and most technologically advanced phones with a normal 3,5-mm-Öffnung headphones cost up to fifteenth out ending crowns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The advantage of the players is again in the easy operation. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Anyone can really serve the simplest and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - players. </seg>
<seg id="61"> A minimum of works, the similarity during the operation with earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or, for example, the record player is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="62"> No collision in form one threatens mistakenly employees of mobile Internet and then a horrendous bill for communications. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> For the equipment they should do now </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a Slot for interchangeable storage media (type microSD M2, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="65"> Even if you buy a card but two thousand crowns are sufficient. </seg>
<seg id="66"> But attention. </seg>
<seg id="67"> With the basic models usually only cards with a maximum capacity are supported by 2 GB. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the most expensive too can read 8-GB-Speicherkarten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> If you want to have a mobile phone and to buy a cheap MP3-Player, then you have to Cowon, Creativ, Sony and Samsung, Emgeton or more iriver. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Depending on their capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put any more than 1100 kronor on the table. </seg>
<seg id="71"> If you are among the more ambitious listeners, take more specialized mobile phones, Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). </seg>
<seg id="72"> These devices have independent operating knobs for MP3, and the control of comfort approaches to individual MP3-Players. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Here is the furthest Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phone from the series Walkman has the same user interface as the MP3-Player sold separately. </seg>
<seg id="74"> The same services at the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long accumulator life-span (normally 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours) MP3-Player manufacturers' abovementioned carries out for you. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first virtual supplier is already this year to the Czech Republic. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Perhaps </seg>
<seg id="3"> The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, the Czech providers offers a virtually all services, how they are offered by their partners in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, this is not a little, a virtual supplier, forcing the classic to lower prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Perhaps that will no longer be long in coming. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Czech mobile phone operators work on the most expensive in Europe, we have often Mobil.cz reported. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which drew attention to the fact that the price for a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European union. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the final stages of the European commission in the adaptation of roaming charges so it is probably a paradox, for some customers of the Czech mobile phone operators SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> How is it that prices are so high in the Czech Republic, compared with Europe? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition, which really is a challenge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Perhaps it sounds paradoxically, in the Czech Republic, there are three mobile networks and the enforcement of more than 100%. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The mobile phone operators grumble opposed happy about the fact that there is a lot of competition in the Czech market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Often, the chairman of the council of the Czech telecommunications authority (ČTÚ) agrees with Pavel Dvořák, which has often expressed in the past that there is no place for another supplier in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is true that a classic supplier with its own network does not have any more particularly many opportunities (it would probably find little frequencies). </seg>
<seg id="15"> But there is another possibility, a virtual supplier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The access of virtual operators on the mobile phone market has a clear price reduction in itself, including the classic mobile phone operators then had to react. </seg>
<seg id="17"> There have been similar votes before the access of such companies such as Tesco to mobile or Virgin Mobile market in Britain as in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But it has been shown that there is room for such suppliers and that they can really be successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> By the way, you need to look for a long time, for example. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This February we spoke at the start of the virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In just six months, managed to this supplier to win more than 100 thousand customers and become in such a way to five-largest supplier of the country. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Behind the Mobilking Penta- banking association, which stands for US in Czech Republic, among other things. fon has. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The advantage of virtual providers lies with the fact that we can focus on a much more specific target group. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order to be able to operate effectively, virtual providers need much less customers as a classic supplier. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They need a relatively high costs of the building, the company and maintaining a mobile network. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the world, so the virtual providers are normally themselves as Low Cost companies, they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, what is often accompanied by a less extensive service. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> For example, Tesco offers mobile in Britain SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. </seg>
<seg id="28"> However, as an example of Mobilking points to Poland, it can also be a good move to put on a plateful not targeted. </seg>
<seg id="29"> This supplier is directed specifically to men. </seg>
<seg id="30"> “Real chaps Mobilking - elect the supplier who made them and what they can trust,” David Seibert, the CEO of the mobiles entertainment company, the company of this virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="31"> To say on whether a similar approach could gain in Poland in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubt: “The Czech market is relatively low for a market segment in which most virtual operators are based. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, it is relatively saturated from the perspective of service.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In the Czech Republic chanceless, mobile phone operators believe </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone carrier conquers Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking. </seg>
<seg id="36"> “We are talking about an extension of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not look particularly hopeful. </seg>
<seg id="37"> It will come to a market access for Mobilking in other countries in the region,” then Jana Studničková, press spokesman for the banking syndicate Penta- says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Indirectly confirmed that the current mobile phone operators have not been particularly prone to the Czech Republic that idea. </seg>
<seg id="39"> On the contrary, they are trying to do everything to ensure that any potential competitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Their interest in the launch of a virtual mobile phone carrier shows for a long time the group of GTS Novera who want to take another step towards a real competitor of Telefónica CO2 in corporate clients. </seg>
<seg id="41"> “We have a strong interest in it, our customers not only fixed network to offer but mobile telecommunications. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And the sooner, the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> On the way we negotiated repeatedly with all the Czech mobile phone operators. </seg>
<seg id="44"> With some of them we have already achieved negotiation progress”, so the press spokesman for the group of Pavel Kaidl. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Perhaps now better times. </seg>
<seg id="46"> With no official information indicates that the first virtual supplier is to be expected by the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="47"> So far, however, it is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. </seg>
<seg id="48"> “At this moment we do not trust in the Czech Republic held for a full virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market has great Specifics compared to other markets. </seg>
<seg id="50"> So far, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area, means” in its statement on Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press office of Telefónica CO2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> The specifics of the Czech market continues providers. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The press spokeswoman von T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the declaration of CO2: “So far we have found no viable and reciprocally favourable project, which could be built.” </seg>
<seg id="53"> And he adds: “In the network of T-Mobile until the end of the year, barely a virtual supplier will emerge. </seg>
<seg id="54"> At the moment, we must have a concrete offer to attend to think all short-term.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone is drawing more attention to meet the needs of its own 3G-Lizenz. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav Čepický resources: “For negotiations with potential virtual suppliers, we are open, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> We see this from the perspective of the customers as the best. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a quick mobile Internet.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The responsible authorities, with the suppliers hand-in-hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The trial of the mobile phone operators is easy to understand, another supplier would mean more competition, this to falling prices and to a drop in profits would lead. </seg>
<seg id="61"> So why should we make the market access for such a competitor? </seg>
<seg id="62"> The fact that the operators can work together, if it is something that is also the long back and forth by the emergence of US: fon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Perhaps the most pressure toward ČTÚ at present, as US: fon on the market, from society T-Mobile got along. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The publicly - available information occupied by the ČTÚ websites. </seg>
<seg id="65"> But now it is suitable American: fon as a reason why we should not allow a virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Martina Kemrová said: “The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently strengthened by the market access for a fourth mobile phone operator. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Given the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech republic, it is clear that a new player would make high demands on the market and in particular his services.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> In light of the actions of the mobile phone operators, however, the absolute lack of interest in the Czech regulators surprises. </seg>
<seg id="69"> It is not just about the attitude of the ČTÚ who do not have the authority to Czech people unfortunately, in contrast to Britain and other developed countries, to intervene in the economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="70"> This is only the office for the protection of the economic competition (ÚOHS). </seg>
<seg id="71"> However, this was a very typical attitude to the entire problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> “The market access to a virtual mobile phone carrier would be possible, after it came to a conclusion of a contract, the infrastructure needed between a mobile phone operator and a virtual provider on rent. </seg>
<seg id="73"> So far, none has concluded that treaty because the offer of potentially interested was probably for the classic suppliers not sufficiently interesting” that in his response to our request Kristián Chalupa of the ministry of foreign - affairs of the ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> Representatives from the providers such wording would not surprising. </seg>
<seg id="75"> An authority that consumer interests to represent, among other things, it is to ensure that no one is abusing its position in the market, is this more than precarious. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: “Abroad, where virtual suppliers working quite normally, it is apparent that its market access contributed to a price reduction cell phone services.” </seg>
<seg id="77"> But the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction do not belong to the interests of the ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> Almost shocking the agreement of the three mobile phone carrier already touching on this case, which results from their reactions, is real. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="80"> In the same way that absolutely gasoline price resembles the gas stations surely only chance, and the result of a tough competition. </seg>
<seg id="81"> “The authority did not discover that any signs that point to act against the competition, and therefore has no reason to intervene in some way in the matter. </seg>
<seg id="82"> Neither the supplier has a dominant market position, so it is not the appropriate greater responsibility for his actions on the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The necessary tools for an opening of the mobile phone market for virtual operators are not likely to the regulatory authority for telecommunications, Chalupa said in his statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious issues. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by the ČTÚ, after which telecommunications from the perspective of economic competition is a single market. </seg>
<seg id="86"> In such a market then, of course, none of the Czech mobile phone operators holds a dominant position. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Some legal experts, however, offer another aspect of the market access to a virtual supplier has always supported by the network user is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And the mobile phone carrier - logically, on its network the monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="89"> It means that it will take a dominant position in a certain segment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Even if you do not go along with this reasoning, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three mobile phone operators are remarkably similar. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Complaints of a series of interested parties ,including the society said GTS Novera) show that they encounter with negotiations with all providers very similar obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="92"> The transfer of the responsibility for the ČTÚ is in the telecommunications a perfectly normal trick with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole affair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> This has been seen in some similar cases. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately, we have not succeeded in getting the recently adopted amendment of the telecommunications law extending the authority of the ČTÚ in terms of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts that it had promised to improve the situation. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The representatives of the ÚOHS must know that all too well, but they have other interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It is as if no one looks </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> A functioning any remains ignored pseudovirtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks. </seg>
<seg id="98"> There are companies who spend own price lists on mobile telecommunications, which are only partially public. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Normally it is companies that operate in the area multi-level marketing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The price lists of these companies are usually only at chosen one. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The joke of the matter is that with the company as an operator to traditional corporate customers, which has a large quantity of SIM cards orders. </seg>
<seg id="103"> As an important customer then it gets special quotes (and other offers). </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone operators ban a similar accounted for resale. </seg>
<seg id="105"> “There should be cases that tell you, it is a violation of contract terms with concern, which we will look to” answered Kemrová Martina lead to an end to cooperate with our society to question on this issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> However, it is unlikely that it does not get around with the leaders of the mobile phone operators. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Particularly in the case of the three companies said this may be thousands of customers. </seg>
<seg id="108"> No operator opposes such a procedure. </seg>
<seg id="109"> From the activities of these companies to their profits to be neglected does not flow, at the same time, in contrast to the actual virtual providers, not by real official marketing is compromised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> On possible problems Miroslav Čepický draws attention: “The law allows such kinds of speculation, despite all the services of these companies by only a very small percentage of clients. </seg>
<seg id="111"> They must also accept that the SIM map does not run in his telephone on their names, so it can fully on it as ordinary customers of the mobile phone operators.” </seg>
<seg id="112"> Alone, but the ČTÚ would have to occur at least strange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> In addition, another question for the ÚOHS opens. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Do the mobile phone operators before such a procedure close their eyes, why they fill out against a virtual provider? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It is to be added to the fact that the ÚOHS has very strong authority to detect such activities and if it does not want, does not have it with the declaration of the suppliers, you would know nothing themselves and their business conditions that would ban would be met. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> The Czech Republic is not the most expensive longer </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> As has repeatedly emphasized in the text, the market access of virtual providers brought a sharp fall in prices in the various services. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Virtually all countries where virtual providers emerged, the traditional providers tried to prevent whose emergence practically more or less. </seg>
<seg id="119"> The argument that they were virtually identical, too small, or too much saturated market, problems with the quality of service, and so on. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> In the developed countries but has engaged in these moments regulatory bodies that did not try to protect the interests of the mobile phone operators, but those of their customers. </seg>
<seg id="121"> If it is formal action or not-formal pressure, they have achieved the first virtual operator developed, and further followed this. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies to throw out the entire case like a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> On the basis of our experience, we can not the impression to get rid of this ambiguity is as good as the authority in these cases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> But we do not throw the gun in the grain. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If the background is accurate and soon a virtual supplier arises, the Czech mobile phone market will contact may soon. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If a supplier allows the emergence of a virtual mobile phone operator, the ÚOHS will not stand idly by when it comes to other interested parties to refuse to discriminate against (). </seg>
<seg id="127"> And the Czechs will not last longer telephone more expensive than in the rest of Europe. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The Sudeten Germans had asked for 1945 for belonging to the Bohemian Forest to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Such a letter that stores in the collections of southBohemian scientific library. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> If we can not be part of Germany and Austria, we would like to live at least under the auspices of the United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="5"> With such a desire 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans at the US presidents should have appealed. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is partly from a letter that remained in private archives, which is now being kept in the collections of southBohemian scientific library. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The german Krumau ask in the letter, the American president, it is the return “Sudetes gau”, which has taken on the basis of Munich agreements by Hitler - Czechoslovakia not to allow. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> “We wanted the situation correctly understood and we really the words to make sure that the American forces did not oppressors and enemies in German territory, but as liberators,” it said in a letter that with the words “people, to whom the fate of Sudetes is concerned about” is signed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the context of Czechoslovakia the Sudeten Germans, with knowledge of the Czech national character, leaving to assume that they would expect brutality, recklessness, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery, asks the authors of the letter, the American president to take over for today and forever the protectorate over the Bohemian Forest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> “We do not believe that you award without regard to the opinion of a quarter of a million people in this area to a state strange for us which oppresses minorities and tried to remove and absolutely nothing to the victory of the allies did not contribute” to read the letter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The reason why the authors can not sign, was allegedly the fear of Rachegelüsten of “Czech oppressors.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> If the american president has doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, there is enough if it would launch in Bohemian Forest gau referendum on whether the people wanted or under a protectorate of the United States to live in the united states. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of post-war may seem a little naive, it provides a good picture yet, according to some modern witnesses regarding expectations at the time of the Sudeten Germans. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Even if the Bohemian Germans had to guess at least that one should negotiate about his expulsion from the republic confessed only few from such a possibility. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some have maintained that the United States and Britain for Sudetes would negotiate a kind of autonomy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Others believe that they could be easy in Czechoslovakia. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> The accident, which last week a twenty-two-year old hostess died, was probably caused by the driver of the Trucks, which crossed the bus. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The young woman sat at the time of the accident, next to the driver, at least the safe place in the car, although she had two other positions. </seg>

<seg id="25"> “But a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Just as in the city bus or in a tram. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The security of the stewards to clarify the winner by internal rules,” says it and also means that this problem from the point of view of the law is not completely resolved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Jančura is prepared to remove the services </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Student Agency provides services of stewards as the only bus company. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The company employs about two hundred people in this job. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The director does not consider his career after the accident as risk pregnant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> “As soon as I get the impression that the occupation of the stewards risk is pregnant, I will remove. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Coffee and newspapers can receive when passengers arriving. </seg>
<seg id="34"> That would lower, means” the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in his buses. His company has only a fraction of the lines in comparison with student Agency. </seg>
<seg id="36"> “We do not have hostesses, on the other hand, we are right from the start. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Sooner or later this ends with a fatal accident,” it a year ago for Týden.cz had not fully said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> That was an enormous tragedy </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> In the crash of a bus to Naples a young hostess from the region Pilsen had had an accident, who had worked for two years to society. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The slovene truck was bent and had blocked the trip to the bus without probably flash from standing tyre. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The driver of the bus tried to escape from a sharp manoeuvring clashed with the right front part of the truck. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The fact that the two places for the stewards were sold denies Jančura. </seg>
<seg id="43"> “These bodies can not be reserved for remote links, they are blocked.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> The company wants to sue Truck drivers. </seg>
<seg id="45"> With a compensation for the families of the young woman, the agency for the court decision not to wait a financial compensation expects it but also on the part of the blame. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> A law change? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Not in sight </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> A more detailed regulation of the movement of stewards aboard a bus could bring a legal system, in which a thirty-member expert panel of the Ministry of Transport is already working for over a year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> “But even arrived at no definite conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Buses are not completely on the agenda, but the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones during the trip” for specialist Hořín. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> “The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards as something that could endanger the safety of passengers significantly” so Hanzelka, taking control of the security of the buses lies in the authority of the police and the industrial safety authorities. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Düsseldorfer hopes resting at Frankfurt </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> At large said it is not missing in the letter of the WestLB executive committee to the staff of the house. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It brought in on Monday to become known letters from units Düsseldorfer of bank in Frankfurt Deka bank can “the central capital market house jointly by the bank banking association” arise. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The WestLB would bring a “authority to block” sustainable yield capacity in such a deal. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And all this can be a decisive blow to further bundlings in the regional sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> So it is when an executive committee wants to demonstrate in difficult time ability to act. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Because the bruised WestLB still is under enormous pressure. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also by the Federal institute for supervision of financial services, which made it clear to the government recently, the time of pressure to find a solution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> From there, as always, any link between the Deka bank savings bank customers know because of their investment funds, and which is WestLB but for some time, the speech at Frankfurt. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Deka bank head of Franz Waas let highway with a regional, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, in a merger of the house in Mainz, is familiar with the presentation of the annual figures half of August he no sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But the board of directors of the Deka supported ever half by the regional and the clubs of savings banks, gave the executive committee to lead the WestLB of discussions on joint business activities. </seg>
<seg id="12"> This could be capital-market operation or parts of it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The talks have undoubtedly, it is just beginning with the financial centre. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the Deka bank, one of its 3000 staff among the more important employers at the Frankfurt financial centre, is not for the first time to talk about consolidation in the bank sector. </seg>
<seg id="15"> 2003 long it looked at such a time, as if the Deka bank with the regional and the Helaba could fuse. </seg>
<seg id="16"> From this three-federation whatsoever. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The plans were hardly be publicly declared itself the government against a part of the Helaba in it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The other two houses did not find it to each other. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The regional Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional baden-württemberg in Stuttgart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But it was thought play again and again on a combination of Deka bank with regional. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But Günther Merl, chairman of the Helaba had spoken out against last planning games on bringing together with his house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> But the reality is independent mature that moving closer together the various houses of the public sector is needed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Now that the election of the past is in Bavaria, linking the BayernLB with the regional could move closer baden-württemberg first. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news. </seg>
<seg id="25"> If the pressure should rise to further mergers, you go out gradually partners for it. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the south, it would be more junior partner, although they got through the financial crisis so far, far better than have the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Once again, the bank and giro centre association hesse Thuringia involved with 85 percent of the Helaba, placed at the beginning of the year, a stop to unite forward with the west LB. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The north would if necessary remain LB. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Such geostrategic considerations are only one side. </seg>
<seg id="30"> On the other side there is the question of how the various business models of the individual homes fit to each other. </seg>
<seg id="31"> June expressed Merl, which is not a crucial issue that business model, the future of the regional is guaranteed by the German savings bank and giro centre association previously responded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> In the end the dismantling of the west LB could face, but it certainly desired. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Like that of the speech, it is certainly a “overall solution” for the house is sought in the letter of the executive committee. </seg>
<seg id="34"> How can bring about the unifying of individual units with Deka bank, will still be seen. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo real Estate </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The German banking system passed relatively stable, said Finance minister Peer Steinbrück only in the week. </seg>
<seg id="3"> As well as the politician used and even enwove the word “relatively” that the German banking sector is not spared the crisis-charged developments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Because they arrived at the weekend. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The DAX Munich real estate financer Hypo recorded real Estate (HRE) receives from a consortium of German banks a billion-credit to shield itself from the turmoil in the markets. </seg>
<seg id="6"> One of the things people trusted Reuters said on Monday, the credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Hypo real Estate has to pay interest on the part that she also addresses. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The money comes from both private and public banks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Background are losses in the daughter Depfa. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Staatsfinanzierer had refinanced itself extremely at short notice, according to a newspaper report for long periods projects, for which he received money, which is now no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the first half of 2008, the cash reserve bank had shrunk, including the equity capital quota slightly from 1,6 to 1,45 percent had given way by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The current earnings and net proceeds from financial transactions were over the period last year zero, the proceeds from attributions of demands and certain securities as well as from the dissolution of reserves in the loan business by more than 70 percent to 5 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Only thanks to higher returns from refunds of stored accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as from the reimbursement of interest for the tax code and the management of secretary of state enterprises, the yield on minus 16 percent had to be even moderate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> That former Staatsfinanzierer had made a bad speculation after its privatization in the year 1990, first with commercial real estate loans, which had been separated in the Aareal bank. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Because they earned too little in the classic state funding, the Depfa was then strengthened in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects of private investors and the state committed (private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The value of the daughter the Hypo must make real Estate now write-offs, which will have a “substantial material effect” on the profit and loss account of the group, called it a vague. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The fact is that the dividend was removed. </seg>
<seg id="18"> For 2007, it had been cut by two-thirds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The Hypo real Estate has since the Depfa took an important state and Infrastrukturfinanzierer. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is more than other institutes at the refinancing at the interbank market because it does not have a client deposits. </seg>
<seg id="21"> With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago credit under the banks is largely dries up, so the banks their liquidity strongholds. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Hypo real Estate needs a year for a part - approximately 50 billion of the loan portfolio of Depfa short-term funds for refinancing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> After report of the Hypo material, the financial needs of the group with the credit is in the foreseeable future covered for Property and the company “of the influence of currently largely nonfunctioning international money markets” protected. </seg>
<seg id="24"> From other sources, it is said that because of the money the refinancing of 2009 is assured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The HRE CEO George spark said, however, that the Hypo will not have to take real Estate Group included the money markets in the foreseeable future. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Federal Bank and the Federal institute for supervision of financial services (BaFin) assume the marketability of the Hypo is real Estate group now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> That stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank of hope. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But given the momentum and uncertainties about the crisis there can be no certainty. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not inconceivable that funding does not have to be included in its entirety. </seg>
<seg id="30"> However, the opposite is not auszuschleißen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> After Sunday on late evening after hearing the bank stood before the bankruptcy, at least temporarily rescue is not able to reassure the mood. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The share price breaks in by 75 percent to 3.30 euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Against the lending rates remain quite good. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If the priority debts last themselves barely moved show, giving the courses of Nachrang loans. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Above all, hitting the loans from the former subsidiary are Württemberg Hypo and understandably journey times beyond 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If Hypo real Estate loans appear before a speculative plant alternative, their value to the significant increase in banking crisis and the institute, which had just caught up with the takeover of Depfa crisis in the house when dependent on the stability of the international financial system is considered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> As long as the central banks, government and less bruised commercial banks in support of the system is ready, it can be stemmed from a period-fristgemäßen repayment of pensions. </seg>
<seg id="38"> And it is one that hardly anyone dares to look at the moment, that the financial crisis is bridge over the next 15 months. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> But given the messages to assess the partial nationalisation from the probability bordering security only a legitimate hope is currently. </seg>
<seg id="40"> This should prepare especially some sleepless nights with the decision for long-term creditors, whether they are separate from its liabilities. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Short-term investors can use a line for a loss brought forward from previous accounts for the future of paying off tax payments on gains in later years. </seg>

<seg id="3"> What this means? </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sylvana knows the word from a gas, in the new exchange that she tells of Japan. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="5"> “The first day of school in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I was excited. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Even before the way to school I had Bammel. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I live on the fringes of Tokyo toward Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes, the Tachibana Highschool. </seg>
<seg id="9"> I had to find the way alone, fortunately, I have not got lost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Beginning of instruction appears not strictly defined as the Tachibana as at home in Lower Saxony. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The pupils roll up after eight o'clock until around twenty nine a brief discussion round begins with the teacher, the “home room.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But before school started, I was in turn to me. </seg>
<seg id="13"> I am not the type who likes to talk to people, especially in a class of 40 pupils. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because I have not had a school uniform, I had suffered an old rock of my guest mother, however, blue blouse knee socks and black leather shoes. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In the elevator I asked myself and therefore tried before the desk to make everything properly: “Sayonara where she Sylvana…” I hot Sylvana, come from Germany and have in one week birthday. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the moment, I was very pleased that I had already begun before over two years to learn the language. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The 31 girls in the class gossiped secretly, and gekichert gewunken and I keep the word “Kawaii” all heard. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I already knew that from my one gas. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It is a critical vocabulary of Japanese girl and means “nicely, sweetly.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> I am quickly flitted in my place. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The girl grinned beside me, i thought it was rather an extensive credit that the exchange student alongside it should sit. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The rest of the time was more calm, but when the gong sounded, I was stormed outright. </seg>
<seg id="23"> All the talk in disarray and kicherten and asked me holes in the stomach, genuinly it is difficult to understand Japanese English. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the break all their unpacked Bentos. </seg>
<seg id="25"> My guest mother had made such a Lunchbox for me, that is times something other than desert German break bread. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I had rice with herbs, small small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> I usually do not have a pale embers, what I eat here in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Things look strange and taste entirely new. </seg>

<seg id="30"> Naja, until the salty inserted plums, perhaps brrrr! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Bentos is at Japanese schools, not just the lunch. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Sometimes it is the fact that a girl gives a boy a Bento even prepared, which is preparing her then skilful, particularly in the hope that closer knows the boy with the break snack to learn. </seg>
<seg id="33"> I was in my Manga comics. </seg>
<seg id="34"> I am now interested to see if I can also see here. </seg>

<seg id="43"> On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strictly, disciplined and traditional. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Also rats have feelings </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A rat or a cockroach flees with danger is that it is also fear? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The neuro scientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Too many animals have feelings. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Just as they were investigating whether the same feeling when they behave as we? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Internet magazine “Edge” are published for several years of contributions of famous scientists. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Spiegel online presented in a series elected answers to the question “what you believe it to be able to prove without it?” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness, unless I or anyone else to show where we could even to prove not to be able to other people have consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But in this case we must hope at least, since all human brains are the same basic configuration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> As soon as we are, however, other species and questions of feeling or generally awareness address we enter hard-to-travel area because the hardware disagrees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> If a rat is at risk, it is the same as many other animals: It is dead, flees or attacks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> People are similarly, some scientists close on comparable subjective experience. </seg>
<seg id="12"> I do not think. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Two aspects of the brain structure, making it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to of animals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> On the one hand, almost always the circuits associated with human consciousness close the lateral prefrontal Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the remark/control functions). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This vast region is much more sophisticated with people than with the other primates and appears with other creatures to be missing. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At least with those aspects of our awareness to plan and decide which depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among them is the knowledge, who we are, and the ability to think that people are very different from the other primates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Another dramatic capacity will be in the linguistic human nature: Since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said, awareness depends on it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this case, it could exclude animals. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But even if awareness did not depend on language, this would undoubtedly influence them so that animal awareness may also be accounted for, like it, probably a lot of most of our awareness of differences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> It is difficult to determine how awareness may look to other animals. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If it is something at home and subjective, neither nor study, let measure because of the special hardware, on the basis of our own experience, with its research before major problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Most of what i refer to the content of deliberate experience, but there are beside it another aspect of awareness, which should be scientifically more easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> One could investigate the consciousness of animals without regard to their content, and what happens studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly in the case of visualization. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But with this approach, Christof cook and Francis Crick followed, it is about the neuralen korrelate awareness as the causal mechanisms. Both must be identical or not. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Interestingly, it also stresses the importance of the prefrontal Cortex to visualization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> What is now the feelings? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system is activated like that fear in one of his own work conscious brain. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What we call “fear” is the mental condition in which we are, if the activity of the system in the brain (or their consequences, how physical reactions) main memories occupies. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In that sense feelings are closely tied to the regions of the Cortex, what distinguishes primates and especially people. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The Hispanic voters to raise is a difficult task. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Bar rack's Obama's suggestions about education is a case in point. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Obama's campaign referred to successfully conclude “the likelihood of afro American and Hispanic students school is lower than with white pupils”, which is right. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In order to close the performance gap, Obama's education plan recommends a bilingual transition in training for those who learn English only particularly among others. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The question for Obama is whether his commitment to the bilingual education, which focuses on education in languages other than English is contrary to their interests, reduce the gap in the school performance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> We take a primary school as an example “Sixth Street Prep” in the eastern Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The majority of the pupils are Hispanic and come from families with low income. </seg>
<seg id="11"> More than a third pupils, many of which are only recently in the country, learn English. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, in 2008 astonishing 100 students of the fourth class insisted the state review in math at a good level. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Similarly, surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year in the English review as good were assessed. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This amazing success has been made in other ways than those who are preferred by Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The school Sixth Street puts its focus on review and exercise, constant monitoring of the knowledge and an attitude that do not tolerate exceptions. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Furthermore, the school early practices, after which the training in an english-speaking environment. That is exactly the point that Obama has to consider, so the head mistress Linda Mikels. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This approach stresses the almost exclusive use of the English language in the technical information. </seg>
<seg id="18"> She Mikels who rejected the idea of bilingual education, told the school had a remarkable success with a student who had only just before from Mexico. 12 Months later, it has entered the classroom and him longer to see no. </seg>
<seg id="19"> “It worked,” he said, “it worked for us.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Obama would take a school like the “Sixth Street Prep” as a model for other schools in much of Latin - American and other English to learning pupils? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The performance of the school would make the answer to that question easy, but the educational positions within his own party (national Bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time, the idea of bilingual education) and its own strong support of the bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> While it agrees to the point that immigrants should learn English, it trivialisiert recently the subject of identification that people should stop, concerns about the legislation aimed at “only English” makes itself. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Instead, he said: “You have to ensure that their child Spanish can”. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Obama if it really wants to close the performance gap, he is to consider carefully education models that function, instead of her to despise and trivialisieren. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Pride and strains in the life of the black population, in a city of particular type </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hidden among the excesses of the recreational parks in the periphery of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, away, a quiet city is loud and gigantic driving with pride and the complications of American culture Afro show. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the hometown Zora Neale Hurstons, are no longer as easy to describe as Hurston it in 1935: “the city with 5 lakes, three croquet posts, 300 brown fur, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison.” </seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, it is a pilgrim. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and rubin Dee are to the annual Zora! Festival intend to Eatonville around the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And still remains the city, which describes it, and it to a tourist destination of the outing made by including it in the Florida tour guide produced in times of depression of federal writer project, in many ways a place of the special variety. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Eatonville is as independent, mother and private as into the 1930ern when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to sharing their true thoughts on the white man “so little about us knows that he did not know what he escapes.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Even today, in a year in a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, an open debate about race conditions calls, is that many here still suffering by outsiders to be closely monitored. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> “We are very much on it mindfully like our history are told” so Hortense Jones, 59, from birth at a resident town and community member of the oldest of town. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It must be right.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Eatonville was defined as paradox of Triumph and the fight. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is both a historic example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 residents, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the state average. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is a focus of the literature and the other is an example, sometimes praised, sometimes condemnation of the black culture of rural south, which has its roots in the American slavery. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is not surprising that residents are both proud and on the hat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And the doubts really started to really Eatonville's image with Zora, as all Hurston calls here. </seg>
<seg id="16"> She presented her hometown in books, and were written into dialect of hearts in the world, as “Mules and Men” (1953) and “Their Eyes were watching God” (1973) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Five sales in the Florida tour guide changed the city, which is very close to the route 77, a road through the often-forgotten center of Florida, leading to the scenes of black history and human tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Impudently like Oskar both in real life and in literature, led Hurston reader to load of Eatonvilles first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then more private affairs. </seg>
<seg id="19"> “Cold on the road to the left,” he wrote, “those brown, white painted modern school, with their alleged gardens and playgrounds, more than ever, the Howard Miller worries, although it is difficult to read and write.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> She also mentioned the new leader of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn “drinks of any kind and sold as always hourly rooms suits.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In just a few hundred words Hurston did so with Eatonville self-government, however, with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This was definitely not travel guide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, this was not a portrait, estimated by all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> “Zora explained things, like it was” so the old 90-year Ella Dinkins, one of the John on the girls' Hurston perpetuated by quoting the men who sang songs on its beauty, full of sexual allusions was. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He added: “Some people do not like this.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> One remembers still Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin who returned regularly, after his family had drawn after Jacksonville, Florida. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Augustus Franklin, 77, thought that if Hurston entered the city gebraust, it usually without warning did, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and trousers dressed in a city that today rather imagines himself on his venerable dress style. </seg>
<seg id="28"> According to mr. Franklin most residents were fascinated, while many despised them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> “The people are always happy to see Zora,” said James Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But “it is never too long,” he added, but when it in his chair swung, on a terrace located on the rear that looks at the Sabelia lake where Hurston was probably baptized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As Hurston in 1960 was poor he died and their books made a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Along with the majority of the world's Eatonville seem to have forgotten that. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although she was once a famous writer, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at barnard university in 1920ern, was buried in fort Impact, Florida, where he lived in an anonymous graves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In Eatonville there was no great ceremony, no public readings on a large scale. </seg>
<seg id="35"> “I do not think that they understand their contribution to the world or their heritage in the slightest” Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows”, a biography on the Hurston that 2003 have been published. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The move came in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace the Kennedy boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the community. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Orlan DOS of suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 on the western outskirts of the city. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The proposal was presented when Eatonville still recovering from a difficult phase in its history. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In the 1950s against racial hatred compound brought into the community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> “At this time, often a bunch of white boys and it came threw oranges and things on people who sit down,” said mr. Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="43"> “There was even once it, a woman was killed. </seg>
<seg id="44"> They threw a wassermelone from car.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> In 1955 Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel analyzed the demand of the supreme Court to force integration by revealing its decision in the case Brown against the school council as “insulting instead of my race respect.” </seg>
<seg id="46"> Residents say today that although the lifting of racial segregation was in some ways positive that the group cooperation in Eatonville and self-confidence of its young people weakened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> “Black children were used to be embraced, I recall, one embraced his teacher in the morning and they embraced his teacher in the evening,” N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group for the protection of the Eatonville community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> That may be so long received, he added, teachers and students no longer did not come from the same place. </seg>
<seg id="49"> “We did not embrace its white teacher, because he was a white teacher, I believe there is a cultural divide,” said ms Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> However, the civil rights have contributed to that place for further Zora Neale Hurstons was created, as it did black authors, performers and artists who jumped on themselves on prejudice, with positive self-confidence and statements as: “As someone can refuse to the delight of the society. </seg>
<seg id="51"> I do not understand it.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In the year 1975 was the author Alice Walker nameless tomb towards Hurstons and began to revive her fame to fight. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Five years later much-vaunted Hurston biography of Robert E was found at the Hemenway bookshelves, and made it a part of the American literature canon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> The freeway project was precisely at a time when the Eatonvilles most famous daughter once again in the light of the public. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And Hurstons saw this time old neighbours it as a savior. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> The community has begun to show at 1988 in the planning of a Hurston festival in the district of the construction of the highway was destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Thousands of fans arrived at the opening vent two years later, and each January return many for the ceremony. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> Later, the district turned a few years away from its road-building plans. </seg>
<seg id="59"> “The plans of a five-lane freeway encouraged the city, accelerated with top speed, has attracted real national pride,” said ms Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> She Boyd put it more simply: “Zora saved Eatonville.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> The victory against the freeway project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Came more and more as course-traveled Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who is here since 1993 into the church, and local people began last estimate again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Eatonville was included 1998 to the national historical record. </seg>
<seg id="64"> A new one-story library (of course, named after Hurston) opened boulevard in 2006 at the again-paved and adorned Kennedy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> Nowadays Eatonville is still a feature in Florida: it can sometimes feel only 6 miles from the city centre Orlan DOS like a Hintergasse in summer rain, as small as at that time as it of only 27 black families into the 1880ern was based. </seg>
<seg id="66"> (It is now black to 90%.) </seg>
<seg id="67"> Prominent in search of history Eatonvilles and its significance with caution are often still treated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> For most interviews permission before necessary and certain things, as the wall of painting Eatonvilles of oldest church, which has been removed from the whites, and with the agricultural work is black men, to be allowed to be photographed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> Many in Eatonville, like ms Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their shielded community is misunderstood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> And yet, at the same time, the festival Hurston bigger was born, including a high degree of national pride. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Mostly young people tend to look like Eatonville Hurston their entire race saw: fine, with all its problems, neither worse or better and equally proud, creative and diligent in a silly and mix as any other race and popular party in America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> It is a genuine love for this city in which the voice of mr. Franklins can hear nephews, the old 18-year Edwin Harvey, intends to university to Eatonville to return to work in the city administration or at the police, which could do something to help it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73"> And even the younger people, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from winter park, learned to describe Eatonville correctly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> “Most people who go only here, will think: “Oh, this city is nothing compared with all the others,” said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after the church. </seg>
<seg id="75"> “But if we really ends and one moment in its history, it is a very beautiful city.” </seg>

<seg id="7"> In its project “Flamenco people” represents the German photographer Günter farmer abwechselungsreiche Theatralik of some production on the stage with singer, dancer and guitarist. From this side it was known for artists just a few. </seg>
<seg id="8"> With this proposal the photographer creates a special iconography of Flamencodarstellung at different levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The exhibition, which belongs to the schedule for the month of photography of Flamenco, “reflects the importance of Flamenco, which continues to grow from day to day,” says the artist and makes clear that “Flamenco people” 'no man can be, but if you look at the photographs, then the viewer notices that there is not a typical images of artist on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Ordinary people on the portraits are artist who are unable to stage passion, sadness, to reach and joy to move the public. </seg>

<seg id="1"> “Sangre de mayo”: Hero book of Garci </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Inspired by “Episodios Nacionales” of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in “Sangre de mayo” represents a new version of the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the french. That is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with about 15 million euro investment for the shootings. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In this way the Cineast has tried “a lot of people and social analysis to represent” what it always admired the works of the famous novelist, today Carci said at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the start of a long list of performers. </seg>
<seg id="4"> “Sangre de mayo” with a film length of more than two and a half hours, was presented and shown later on the station Telemadrid than a four-hour mini series this Friday in cinemas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> José Luis Garci, a big fan of the literature of Galdós assures that, thanks to this shooting his “childhood dream” went into compliance. That it owes to Esperanza Aguirre, three years of the autonomous community Madrid assigned to turn a commemorative film on the second century ceremony at 2 November in Madrid. Above all, because the story was based on the basis of “Episodios Nacionales” who accepted the order. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The overall contribution of 15 million, which was made by the autonomous community Madrid for shootings, offers Garci, he added, “the unique opportunity” by decorations and proper clothing the image of “entangled Spain who chose the wrong leader for the fight, because of the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinands VII behind the people was to represent.” </seg>
<seg id="7"> But the Cineast that they could not count de Goya” (twice as high as with “Sangre de mayo”) on the financing as with “Alatriste” or “lot fantasmas, regrets that could some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel which Garci worked almost his entire career, not be. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For this reason, Garci, who was also a director of film in “Volver” A empezar, attended by his usual function: it has on stage at performers, with whom we must first rehearse before it is beginning to look for those who did not Go ahead, it seemed “humiliating” and respect that, “a part of the occupation of the director of the film is to provide assistance in the theatre and the cinema in order to know what the cinema industry, where it is happening.” </seg>
<seg id="9"> Many performers, whom it discovers de in “Sangre mayo” must go before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Garci, OSCAR candidate in four nominations (from which it won one), believes and assured that none of the three candidates who represent Spain before the Academy OF Hollywood in this year is a younger generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Neither “Sangre de mayo” or “Siete mesas de billar francés” and, ultimately, not the elected film “a lot of girasoles ciegos.” </seg>
<seg id="11"> For this film Garci does not expect awards. </seg>
<seg id="12"> “At the beginning you work for descendants, believe later you say that it is only for a prosperous, and you are happy if they produced”, declared a film Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A Flamencotänzerin from Seville admires a dancer, also from Seville the strain. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Carmen Tórtola Valencia: their father was a catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), it was born in the quarter of Triana and as it was three years old, her family moved to London. </seg>

<seg id="6"> It was Buddhistin, vegetarian and set for the abolition of the corset that limited free female movement. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The life of the woman who left its mark on the dance and aesthetics revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón. </seg>
<seg id="8"> “I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and her to me this role proposed what i seemed impossible.” </seg>
<seg id="9"> “We try not to talk about their lives, let us separate their ESPRIT to preserve,” said the Flamencotänzerin. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Their dance bases helped me a lot in Flamenco. </seg>
<seg id="11"> “The dance of butterfly” seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or “the dance of the queue like” tango. </seg>
<seg id="12"> She was dancing sensuous and told me that i told her dancing in this area aesthetic liegt'. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The production is extraordinary cooperation on two: with Miguel Poveda, which will sing again for Isabel with one of his ideas, as he did it in “La puerta abierta”; and with Flamenco Meisterin Matilde Coral, who wanted to work together, except for one of its ex-pupils. </seg>
<seg id="14"> 'Tórtola Matilde plays a very mature personality. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I am happy, because she has agreed to participate in my work and I feel very interesting. “ </seg>
<seg id="16"> The production is counting on musical composition and Gitaristen Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, on the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the Percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa al Viola and cooperation with the actor Juanfra Júarez, “the role of the companion of artists who were Divas, transfers to whom it again and again in love.” </seg>
<seg id="17"> In this one is in a certain way of life of the woman who in places like India, located as far as we know, the United States or Russia and also in the whole of europe, although it normally lived in London. </seg>
<seg id="18"> “I wanted to withdraw it, because I believe that it is out of the women, a huge influence on a certain age and their work today, none more so and even less estimate know,” said Bayón. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The idea is taking place at 20:30 in the theatre Lope de Vega. </seg>

<seg id="4"> This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field who worked with him in “tabloid reporter”, and then the idea of the american cinema, which left out in the cold, and was followed by came from all of America to Newman with his inspiring idea. </seg>

<seg id="6"> And as 2007 withdrew. </seg>
<seg id="7"> And he knew that it was very ill. </seg>

<seg id="9"> “It sometimes feels is a much more than one, and now I have a great friend lost,” said Robert Redford crying, “my life and my country were the biggest quaintnesses of his life.” </seg>

<seg id="11"> When “father” of the cinema and the native country when he is a sad moment died in fear of terrorists and the market collapse, in that the depressed self-esteem of the Americans in the desperate search for reasons would recover. </seg>
<seg id="12"> If this hard time without virtue only a few people who can be admire, remain, one must be not necessarily Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. </seg>
<seg id="13"> For all anchored it almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and the truth. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He was officially enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered losses, like other both also profits: from the foundation, the fight against drugs used up and in honour of his son from the first marriage, who died at overdoses, one based on its own brand of home and organic products. </seg>
<seg id="15"> All this is a gift to the country in which it cost so much trouble, against a deadly food culture to prevail. </seg>
<seg id="16"> A huge wave of surprise raids on Hollywood decisively irrespective of nationality and citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The latest James Bond, who confirmed Englishman Daniel Craig, that people did not die, but the whole era. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Englishman Sam Mendes, director of film and OSCAR winner, said that the work with Newman was not less or any more than the point of his career. </seg>

<seg id="20"> “The biggest one of us left us all,” confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dared to try to live like Paul Newman lived: high standards at the honesty, a reliable private life, far from the cameras. </seg>
<seg id="21"> That is not easy or not always in today's media jungle. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But there is someone who tried it, and Paul Newman was an example of this. </seg>

<seg id="8"> Nonsense begins with the ticket getting that allows you to go first. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It does not seem to be bad myself, but if they let go, then they should give you all (including chip to avoid the congestion on the road). </seg>
<seg id="10"> After all not. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Here they let you only get the ticket (the first nonsense, which is only going there) and (there after an infinite queue) is the surprise! The T-shirt existed only in the size of “S” (a second nonsense, because I need the crowd XL) </seg>
<seg id="12"> Where do we live? </seg>

<seg id="15"> Apart from the fact that we have to go very soon to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes, but you have to let the backpack. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Waiting for more than 35 minutes took what is incomprehensible in the event of a road, where 11,000 people are expected. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Finally, as it was to be expected, the road began had let our backs bags and we are not even if had succeeded, but to bring back would be even more difficult. </seg>

<seg id="19"> I believe that morning some 500 people pneumonia will certainly have and some as I do because of this chip, which I have with the expulsion of are not even in time, I can imagine that the outcome was wrongly branded. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Discussion of the blood that have again safe </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hema yesterday Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its creation, and its president, dr. Francine Décary, had to be happy all because Hema Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And, above all, it regained the confidence of the public, which had been badly shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the donation service of the Canadian red cross were during the 1980s with HIV and hepatitis the C-virus contaminates. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In light of this tragedy and the dissatisfaction of the public, the government of Canada launched a public, by the judge Horace Krever led investigation, which had the aim to bring to light into the circumstances which led to such a tragedy to prepare and guidelines for February 1994 if another disaster of this kind to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While judge Krever still hesitated to issue its report at that time, several provinces have put a committee on the ground, whose aim was to build a new system for the administration of units of blood in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In Quebec Gélineau committee met this order. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the reports and Gélineau Krever in Canada two blood banks were created. Hema Quebec, responsible for Quebec and Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories. </seg>
<seg id="9"> '1998 when Hema Quebec started its work, barely 38% of the people had confidence in the unity of blood system in Quebec, remember dr. Décary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was disheartening. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The huge efforts to ensure the security of the units of blood to improve and the work in this area during the next few years, we have the confidence of the public zurückgewonnen', telling them before they stress that proudly now almost 94% percent of the population of quebec Hema confidence in Quebec had early 2008. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Dr. Décary keeps but knowing that “confidence is something very fragile.” </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since its inception, at 28 1998 September Hema Quebec acts according to the principle of caution. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At this time, we have seen the appearance of numerous cases of human variant of mad cow disease in Europe, a new kind of creutzfeldt-jakob disease, telling the woman who holds the line since the creation of 1998. </seg>
<seg id="15"> 'And we did not have any idea about whether the blood will be transferred to the disease. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which it uses exclusion measures, if you do not know that, if an illness is progressing slowly, as it is clear that calls by degeneration of the brain, which will inevitably lead to death by creutzfeldt-jakob disease. </seg>
<seg id="17"> They did not accept donations from people who had not given 1980 more than a month in the united kingdom April 1999. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Now, a few years ago it was clearly demonstrated that the disease is transmitted through blood. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So this event showed that the principle of caution that we would use is quite a sense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> 1999 appeared on the market, a much more accurate technology for the detection of HIV: The nucleic acid test (service), which make it possible to prove directly in the blood of donor the appearance of the virus and not the antibody against the virus, as it was in the tests used so far. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The service has made it to shorten the incubation period those between the time that the people were infected and for that, if the first viruses can be demonstrated by our techniques in blood, explaining the specialists. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This time could be reduced to a period of less than a week. </seg>
<seg id="23"> So the risk that certain donors could be infected, without knowing it, and one that is not recognize could not substantially reduced. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These improvements made it possible to reduce the risk of transfer payments on a blood transfusion in large measure. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Nowadays, from 12 million people a risk to receive with HIV infected blood. </seg>
<seg id="26"> ', In other words, this means that we would have to distribute 12 million units of blood, before someone was infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Since Hema Quebec distributes each year between 400.000 and 500.000 units of blood, it would take more than 24 years before it happens when HIV through a unit of blood to transfer. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I think we can probably feel today, if you get or using a blood transfusion around the health wiederherzustellen', means the management Hema head of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="29"> 'Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the security of our products. </seg>
<seg id="30"> One never knows the pathogen can arrive in the system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Only last year on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus appeared, which is exactly the same as the west Nile virus transmitted by insects through the blood. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We must constantly überwachen', continue dr. Décary before they stress that Hema Quebec alongside a safe to provide an adequate supply must make available. </seg>
<seg id="33"> 'The need arises, as the population ages. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Since the treatments are more aggressive for cancer patients, often need new red blood or blood corpuscles panels. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ageing populations also affects the blood donor network, which averaged only 3% belong to donations the appropriate inhabitants of quebec. “ </seg>
<seg id="36"> Each healthy people aged 18 years or and fairness that meet criteria to every 56 days, to six times a year, blood donations. </seg>
<seg id="37"> 14% Of the people who make their blood, are not accepted, on average, because they are infected with AIDS and malaria, for example, and to a country went where malaria is common, for one year from donations is excluded. </seg>
<seg id="38"> 'With these 3% we manage to an inventory, which meets the needs of the hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Lack of reserves are extremely rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But we need to renew the members of the donor network when they are older and no more blood to donate. </seg>
<seg id="41"> It is difficult to convince the people to donate blood, above all, to keep them and bring it to regular donors. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Life is now so hectically that you find the time rarely, an hour with blood donation too verbringen', regrets Francine Décary. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With an annual budget of 297 million dollars Hema Quebec does not only produce units of blood, but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, used almost exclusively with heavy fire injuries. </seg>
<seg id="44"> This tissue are under investigation, and worked on frozen, before they are stored temporarily with Hema Quebec, the only public umbilical cord blood bank of quebec administered. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In the umbilical cord that sooner than biomedical waste was considered, rich blood, which can be used for it is serious diseases, such as leukaemia, to treat on stem cells. </seg>
<seg id="46"> ` Several weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood test, and we plan to develop a year more than thousand. </seg>
<seg id="47"> “We should start well at the beginning of next year to make it available for transplants, continue to declare dr. Décary who describes this program the umbilical cord blood decline as very popular. </seg>
<seg id="48"> “Many mothers are believed to have no access to it” because Hema Quebec lack the resources to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals of quebec. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Freedom of expression, the orwellsche speech Barrick gold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In its spending from 17 September Le Devoir issued a letter from mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-general manager of the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms, and has a orwellsche logic that the largest gold production company in the world has a libel action on six million against three authors and small publishing house without money, with the aim of a “public transparent debate” to open. </seg>
<seg id="4"> If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not see the truth, especially in the case of libel actions, but of the law. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As expected, this fundamental difference was completely hidden by mr. Garver. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As for Barrick gold is to be the best form a public debate on everyone to drive to ruin who dares, one of their opposing views. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Whatever the process that the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada are large sums of money to spend to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid by the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Tactics with these unequal fighting is often to ruin the defenders in order to force an amicable settlement, which makes the opposite side silence and everyone deters who dares to return to the issue. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If Barrick gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present their views to the general public. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In contrast, which is common, is that in many countries in which Barrick gold works in Canada debates normally through an exchange of ideas and not by club blows delivered. </seg>
<seg id="11"> That would have been enough if the gold mine had revealed and had opened a genuine debate its books and documents from the newspapers, media publications and financing of independent inspection teams that could have brought light on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But Barrick gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Perhaps could Mr Garver explain how he can at the same time to please the views of a “public” debate nevertheless and ignore the public? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apparently this word in the world of the vice-president only covers the generous paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very good muted aspect of the term. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy, even slanderers have to talk about the right. </seg>
<seg id="16"> What does not understand Barrick gold, or not to understand it, is that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework, many as toggle complaint term (in the process of “public debate” Barrick gold has a call on the authors of Canada Noir, in which she calls for them, it no longer to use…). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Besides the surreal Mr Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct attack on freedom for academic research and the truth, which is essential for any democratic society. </seg>
<seg id="19"> She denied the right to quote and discuss facts and interpretations credible sources that form the basis of the intellectual work. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If it is impossible, such as Canada in a country to investigate and discuss issues, the rich companies in the world does not like who can do otherwise then? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If Barrick gold really wanted a public and open debate, it might bring these by following the scientific standards that were used by the authors of Noir Canada. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It has to answer a right. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The university environment, to which we have known for a long time, debates and inconsistencies under control and to get to solve conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold clearly shows that, contrary to what exists, has no desire to open debate. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time that governments take measures that restrict this kind of unwarranted complaints. </seg>

<seg id="22"> In order to round the positions off for all in congress, it also added an order, so it means that, if the government with this program should make losses within five years, it can raise new taxes, to get their assigned capital. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The new plan provides for the payment of a total of 250 billion to 100 billion will come when the president considers it necessary. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The payment of another 350 billion must be approved in a fresh vote by congress. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In return for his help Washington gets lots of supported companies that make the case of profits dividends, and what it can sell again for him, if the storm ripped past. </seg>

<seg id="33"> But not those who is the taxpayers to pay too bitten'. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The democratic delegate Brad Sherman, head of a group in congress, “the Kaukus of the doubters” means, represents the things differently, but to the same conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="35"> “Four hundred excellent economics professors, including three Nobel Laureates, wrote to tell us too: We ask the congress not to be able to be pressurized too and carefully consider which way to go,” he said. </seg>

<seg id="42"> The companies company-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the investment Jos Bt. are said to have been created by Romanian bricklayers on Iván Kubatovs express wish. </seg>
<seg id="43"> In truth, none of these companies were active, which was under accusing because of a lack of contracts. </seg>
<seg id="44"> However, it could benefit from the companies: To call it, such as his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was awarded the preparation of the formation of a company documents, on behalf of the companies bills to the clubs associated with this in connection with Atlasz and Y-Generáció. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Overall, Kubatov is to have issued 15 bills in the total value of HOOF 14.2 million in the name of the companies' investment funds, delta Trió, company-Bani Jos, investment and Jos Linaxtrade to the organizations. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The public prosecutor's office expects Kubatov could have taken 10% of the bill sum, as well as the VAT in each case. </seg>

<seg id="50"> In order to conceal this, they have the TMA five fictitious invoices of Works team Kft. . </seg>
<seg id="51"> These bills were in fact guaranteed in search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Board of Education. </seg>

<seg id="53"> A sensation could be when the principal defendant János also decided to a comprehensive confession. </seg>
<seg id="54"> His last information was less detailed and, although it had repeatedly promised to report on fully all his confession is pending. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The question remains whether it is in their interest, whether the socialists signed a pact with him on the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by HOOF 50 million, and whether it is in return, ready to take responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="56"> However, it is quite possible that now “insulted” games, after their applications were met with moderating the arrest and the house arrest on deaf ears. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> According to one in the “Science” study want people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, published magazine not beaten to give ourselves and are not prepared to pay even inflated prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The researchers tried to explore the neurological scheme of this “game” with experimental auctions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while others took part in a playful activity, in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were investigated by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> With both plays the players money could win, but increased activity Striatum, a complex was measured below the brain crust, with losers of the auction, which the opponent over-bidding plays a major role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Apart from many other functions that brain region is responsible for the “self reward” of the nervous system. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The researchers said, the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of Striatums. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In order to support their argument, economists in the research group employed additional studies of Nachverfolgung of money. </seg>

<seg id="14"> The third party received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in case of a lost game. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The difference between the two groups consisted only of the fact that the emphasis on the one on winning, while the other one was losing. </seg>
<seg id="16"> As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists but the members of the group playing against losing” were for higher deployments willing than those in the control or “profit” group. </seg>

<seg id="17"> “These results can be derived from a previous economic theory. </seg>
<seg id="18"> They have watched the attitudes of auctions so far only with joy at winning, or risk prevention. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Worldwide, some people with chronic hepatitis B and C suffer half a billion, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease among the leading cause of death is listed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The number of infected people will be treated in this country on a hundred thousand estimated, but only seven thousand, which is due to the fact that the patients often do not know they are infected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Hepatitis is the full term for through various viruses released, liver infectious diseases. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are frequent, but the cause and the disease differ from each other. </seg>
<seg id="6"> According to the agent hepatitis viruses in two different kinds proliferate: with hepatitis A and E by the digestive tract (for example through contaminated food or water), with hepatitis B, C, D can be transferred the virus by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, sheath secretion or saliva). </seg>
<seg id="7"> A vaccine is recommended against the virus C at least gives passengers against viruses A and B it no vaccine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The symptoms of hepatitis A point about two to three weeks to consumption of contaminated food and win from uneasy constitution, weakness, bellyache and nausea. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Then the jaundice on the skin and in the eyes, the chair is brightly, the urine dark, and the recovery can take up to two, three weeks. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Worldwide, approximately 1 million people, the far more serious diseases of hepatitis B die such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected in drug treatment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Including hepatitis C can have serious consequences: untreatedly it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Most infected people do not even know about their disease because the virus destroys the liver cells insidiously, in many cases, the first symptoms point to 20-30 years. </seg>
<seg id="14"> That is why timely contraception, such as regular monitoring investigations, is essential. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There are three groups, where it is more often: those who underwent 1991 of a blood transfusion, drug addicts and tattooed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C sufferers worldwide to 200 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Since the disease has proven during a routine laboratory tests already, it is wise to visit with the first signs of unknown origin, the family doctor. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, with the risk of infection is avoided and prevented the formation of cancer. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Have believer in less pain? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The latest research results show that the religious faith works like a kind of “pain killer”, which is already have facilitated the death of catholic martyrs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Scientists from the Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: It investigated whether the belief in God will feel the pain of man, announced the British tide “telegraph.” </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the course of the rather bizarre investigation received 12 every believer and atheist electric shocks, while they studied a picture of the mother of God. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The results showed the believers could get the most out of the pain. </seg>
<seg id="6"> By means of a brain Scan technology could even be proven that catholics could activate the part of their brain, which is responsible for the painful adjustment. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The investigation was first in a research project in which alongside scientists also thinkers and theologians of different sections of the university. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In seeking the subjects sparkling equipment was put together by the left hand, which gave the electric shocks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The participants were asked to focus attention on two paintings: On the one hand, a picture of the mother of God, stripped of Sassoferrato during 17. Century and Leonardo da Vinci's “lady with Hermelin.” </seg>
<seg id="10"> The researchers hoped that the sight of the virgin Maria under the believers would cause a kind of religious trance, while they elected Vincis picture because it hardly differed and was felt reassured than down from the other painting. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The trial subjects spent a half-hour each in a MRI scanner and received at this time, a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they either religious or the other paintings should respect. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Catholics reported them at the sight of the mother of God “in security” would have felt as if they were “umsorgt”, and they would have felt “peace and quiet.” </seg>
<seg id="13"> During the religious painting they reported about 12% fewer pain, as if they had Leonardos work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The psychologist Miguel far iass, who also participated in the attempt, said that it could cause similar impact on other, pictures, working closely with the atheists, you would have the appropriate photo only to find. </seg>
<seg id="15"> “We would have to find an image that is very positive feelings, such as a mother and a father, so the psychologist. </seg>

<seg id="16"> Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. </seg>
<seg id="17"> “Practicing the faith should change our personality, and do it in many cases” Wright. </seg>
<seg id="18"> After these excellent results remains the only issue that effect would have a Madonna picture Leonardos or other similar painter at the painful adjustment of believers. </seg>

<seg id="2"> At the time of its tenth anniversary can join with Google and right to maintain: it is to be found in the pockets of people exactly as over their heads in the sky. They know where people spent their holiday, to go to experts, and that they are moving. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And that is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one the Google. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Towards doubters that are plagued by Orwell horror visions, it can do: This is the essence of the Web 2,0 overlooked. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In an interview with the Financial Times Schmidt said recently that the main purpose of Google was to collect more personal information on users and so the original purpose of the company's move closer, according to which they make “all the details of this world.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Schmidt said, Google is after ten years of world-changing work still only at the beginning of the data collection. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Asked about the status Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he desired, Google would be able to issues like “what I had to do tomorrow?” or “job really suits me?” in response, but software programs are not yet ready as well as they do not know enough about the users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches search words were registered, as well as the IP-addresses, which was found, and that visited sides. </seg>
<seg id="9"> For example, two years ago, the introduced “Personalized search” permits to store the visitors' its own search process and then go back to so that takes can be generated later many more accurately, and on the same logic, also known as the “Recommendations” is based on the system recommends tailor-made products and services because of the former preferences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Wonders users but, as in the case of a data abuse happened,“if you look at what I do” show some worried whether the Google data monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is in most cases, but rather the potential power that work fear exciting, represented by the company, and less guilt feeling or fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or uprising against power that encounter with many Internet Usern rejection. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But it is a proven fact that the search words are not only stored, but are passed on to starter in the third case, and in these cases of law, there is no protection for the personal rights Internet users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A prime example of this was recently the case against paedophilia in Brazil, during his Google of the Brazilian government information, which was compiled by the Gemeinschaftssite called “and” Orkut also made an identification of pedophilias. </seg>
<seg id="14"> By personal rights procured user could still in Can breathe a sigh of relief when Google has successfully brought together with civil rights organization EFF against the FBI in court: therefore, Google may be forced to continue with no point of the constitution to publish information the FBI in secret. </seg>
<seg id="15"> (Though the Federal Government successfully reached the publication of 50.000 Web addresses and 1,000 search words with reference to years ago passed the protection of children and adolescents law, but you have become the list the individual users, or their Web search and word list on two months withheld retroactively.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Google image of therefore remains controversial: Those who publish their personal data reluctantly, because they fear the loss of their private and privacy by using the Google services, castigate the company with the conservative launching companies rightful indignation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Meanwhile, the American “Geek culture”, which is present in many countries and inspired computer fans, activists and user unites, sees the next generation of the “cool entrepreneurs” in them, unlike Microsoft, which is due to Windows market leader, even if they are fighting for the same purpose. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> A possible reason for this is the fact that Google does not call for his Usern unlike Microsoft identification codes and makes its services free of charge, so openly, constantly updated source code and software package appear to be far more attractive, more youthful and cooler, as the official practices of the software giant. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the other hand, the Geeks look through the problematic relationship of individual rights and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship that moved in particular in recent years, thanks to the term “Web 2,0”. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> With the “Web 2,0” is it to trace nothing else when around collaboration, talk, the user left deliberately and uses the available channels of communication, and even if the proportions are individually different, the main issue remains the same to show that publicly. </seg>
<seg id="21"> An average young person can at the same time manage on several community portals his profile, on Facebook Xanga, can this through other services, such as Twitter, or music services as last.fm to link, and can all in a Nachverfolgungssystem such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm eventually merge. They also can lead blogs, which automatically constitute the latest photo galleries are at geoconstant Flickr or Picasa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> And a number of other exemplary cases shows: With the party photographs of the friend finds out soon, with whom she unfaithful boyfriend distracted himself, or who will lay off workers, because it allows air to his anger in his blog very honest about the management, one thing is certain: The term “confidentiality” has now been entirely new interpreted. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Who is leading an online life, is what he surrenders from, so roughly one could put the philosophy behind the conduct of today's youth. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And who is trying to keep a secret or the Google monopoly, can do so, such as with Scroogle intentionally, but no traces of tools, which hits the search engine of Google, leaves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Many people do not register deliberately at community sides, so they are not discoverable, however, online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphic RSS tools and fed can deal with alternative versions, which are linked to a huge server parks and do not generate therefore the best performance of the user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Public opinion is now to avoid until Google shows its true face. </seg>
<seg id="27"> With its current value of USD 156 billion company is appropriate for Intel (USD 124 billion) even before IBM (USD 140 billion), or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), advertizing space of AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of the advertizing agencies, and the faster introduced services are not only for Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Critical viewers find but also the disturbing antipols: For example, management of the group rejected a protest by the staff, after the charges of company-owned kindergarten have doubled, said the management, the repeated food supply of the staff is too expensive. All this seems almost mild against Google and has agreed to an agreement in the year 2006 before the Chinese government to its knees, according to which all regime-critical takes, or those who violate the good taste, were filtered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The internal regulation of the company is that in advance, no new service is found, but only if it is already available. However, the events in the coming months and years could turn back some strong: While some think of Google magazine paper and CAN or archiving project now accept proportions that the company would have to deal quickly with the supreme Court, are more because of the system “Health” affected others who makes the production of a complete health profile on the basis of findings, doctors and problems. </seg>
<seg id="30"> And the fact that Google is developing a genetic database, provides for the next generation of Sci Fi authors have real - about “Scroogled” which describes famous novel of Cory Doctorow at best orwellschen manners a future in which people are frightening closable thanks to data obtained from Google. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> What is the best way for the development of new technologies to accident prevention, not to imitate if the barrier sensors from nature? </seg>
<seg id="3"> For example, those of bees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the CEATEC in Japan, an astonishing project was presented with Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees in creating new accident of avoiding systems. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In cooperation with the Tokyo university built steered organic MIME tables system of the type of Nissan BR23C autorobots that from a mini cars, equipped with the characteristics of bees, to support a goal, the development of a system that avoids any clashes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the air each bee forms its own, oval “private sector, which is very similar to our own “shield,” said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR research and development, with the exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The compound of the bee which can see in every direction and in a corner of over 300 degrees, plays an important role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In order to copy the workings of the compound, the researchers took up the idea of laser-steered distance area finder. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, computes its routes and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which opens the collision-avoiding process immediately. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The barrier is registered in fractions of a second, and the autorobot immediately changed the course, similar to the movement of bees, by turning the tyre on the spot. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unlike past systems this ploy purely instinctive will take place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> “If it would be, the autorobot could not respond quickly enough, around the obstacles to escape,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the “Mobility Laboratory” and the autorobot project. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The system must respond to instinctive immediately and, since this technology is the home and most vulnerable part of the shield, for a class at present, within the accidents even as inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The entire process must reflect the conduct of bees, if they avoid other bees. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And that must be conducted in a fraction of a second. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> But can be avoided, unlike the bees, not up and down, or diagonally takes place, it can only be two-dimensional, only to turningability of tyre. </seg>
<seg id="17"> While many opportunities for bees infinitely here openly in order to avoid another bees, the researchers could use of the rotating motion, or and accelerate the deceleration autorobot only. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BR23C polymer contains lithium batteries, which are easier and more energy efficient, and therefore a longer life span, than conventional lithium-ion batteries. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Now the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar of heavy rescue package law, which will have to be used in several stages and the purchase of bad loans from the banks. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the first round, half the money should be spent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In a meeting which went on Saturday until midnight local time east coast, in the end, the congressional representatives struggled through themselves, announced after debates for several days to reach an agreement on the 700-Milliarden-Dollar heavy rescue package Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> “We have made,” said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the U.S. congress, and substantial progress, we need to get the agreement only on paper. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Both presidential candidates supported the compromise on the rescue package, Barack Obama and John McCain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Finance Minister Henry Paulson meant to the result: The program will show it effective and efficient, but we need to do more. According to Pelosi it would affect rum-tear at the helm of the economy, not the rescue of Wall Street, however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The written version of the package was published, was released but no high-altitude flight on the stock exchanges time before the opening of the Asian markets, so that Washington Sunday evening 8 (Central - European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On Monday, the first of the Lower House to vote on the bill for the strengthening of the economy of 2008, the senate in the series. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday evening with Pelosi, and also the white house welcomed the news of the agreement. </seg>
<seg id="11"> We are satisfied with the night at the progress and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our economy and protect our markets, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the white house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The program is different from the original recommendation by the Bush administration, according to which the 700 billion dollars should be spent at once on the purchase lazier, with loans from burdened securities. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a first Tranche not more than half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages is to be spent, with 250 immediately available billion, according to the congress will vote as expected on Monday at the Causa. This amount is to be spent on the purchase of credit-burdening, bad securities, and that the president is to decide on further USD 100 billion. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The program is being investigated by an independent commission, including the president of the Federal Reserve. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the congress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the spirit of the law, the Treasury can use a combined tactic: It is at the same time, bad loans, mortgages and charged with mortgages bonds to purchase, or other “toxic” loans. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The leaders of the Ministry reported that the purchase can take place in an auction, and directly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The law allows the companies can look to participate in an insurance scheme in which the Treasury guarantees the worrying resources, and the companies that pay for damage expecting similar charges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means that 700 billion dollars as emergency aid to the American financial system can be made available, it is important for the purchase of banned substances, their insurance, or prevent a systemic risk, which is caused by the collapse of a larger bank. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We take the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready for the introduction of the law as soon as it was signed, so Paulson. </seg>

<seg id="22"> A cut in salaries will exist only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury helps out in each case. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Cuts is taxed essentially means that if the Ministry purchases in the context of an auction, so “golden handshake” unless the retired bank head into the pension is deported. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In the case of a direct purchase of bad loans the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that the manager salaries are not excessive. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The picture also means that the existing golden handshake contracts are not changed, the restrictions only refer to new agreements, so that all the more people to participate in the program. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This is the first case in American history that cuts are governed by manager salaries by law, comment on the democrats Barney frank, chairman of the finance committee, the measure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> The state wins equities at the participating banks, so the risk to the taxpayers sinks, since they can also take part as soon as the economy and the savings bank is better. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The bill provides that the president must present in the next five years, a proposal to congress, as the taxpayers are again to recover their lost money from the financial sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> However, there have been on both sides sceptics who expressed their concerns about the plan. </seg>
<seg id="30"> That is what the American people expect us to the plan is protecting the taxpayers' money under any circumstances, so the California republican Darrell Issa. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The elite is in danger </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The phenomenon had revealed a few days ago, when the chamber of deputies voted against the 700 billion-dollar austerity package of the white house: Much of the Americans was and is more interested to punish Wall Street than the economy to save. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms the spending of yesterday by the New York Times, which reports of it, like the crisis in the laufschritt republican party shared that divides more and more in its old and moderate East Coast soul that always encouraged the national institutions and business community and that neoconservative, to “those in Washington,” and the financial world hostile and voter wins v. A. in the south and central to the states. </seg>
<seg id="4"> That part of the party owes its ascent v. A. the voice of what I mentioned above. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This just mentioned example is now only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even is already: only in the united states, including in the entire west and perhaps even beyond those that they will not be affected. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In both states and in Europe the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events that accept and come to light in these new conditions finally taking shape. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first of these phenomena are the latest discovery, the outrageous Renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of re-nationalization of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Indeed, the crisis is a collapse of the banking and financial institutions that close links to the outside world and have a tremendous amount of the fortunes of private households managing at the same time, living in a single state. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This means a direct political problem for the governments: indeed, as compared to the families concerned to withhold applies, whatever represent a huge mass of voters. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The crisis is so global economically, politically against it is almost purely national. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The political internationalism appears to have actually been lagging sidelined and its right to speak have lost: The obvious evidence of this was commissioned by the European Union, which does not know how to find a common way because of its division into different national and international conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="12"> That is why all now count on the intervention of the state; Rescue plans, new rules, and v. A. distribution of relief funds: Since the crisis has become more serious, the united states in the economic situation will only be saved without foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And apart from the money they have also this legitimacy to use: not so two conditions, under certain circumstances, which can be exaggerated, an international organization or otherwise market will probably be able to draw in a similar manner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The new emphasis on the national-national element, moreover, is in complete agreement with the increasingly important, which has recently moved into the economy with one on closest relatives sector in context: the territoriality. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Paradoxical way is it just now, when we were so convinced, long an interconnected global empire to have entered into an empire of technologies, always differentiated non-material one that we must determine at once, how our future will depend more and more on the main material things: Water, harvest and oil. </seg>
<seg id="16"> They can certainly be transported across a place at the others in the world, but are still at most associated with a narrow described piece earth, a territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So what has such a territory, is another opposite who lives in a crop yields, waterless or oilfields free zone in the advantage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Turning to the second novelty, which requires a brief modules. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The territory, which says government who says politics, it also Leadership. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In this sense, the financial crisis appears to produce two converging phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the one hand, there is the awareness of the need for eighth Leaderships, hence the need for anyone who knows how to govern. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On the other hand, now a wave of indignation insists that the existing leadership, v. A. economics, as inadequate and full black spots appeared. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In addition, a deep finally more lange and aspect still worrying in some sense: A loss of confidence, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of distance, all together towards a whole class of managers of the western countries. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It is clear that the conviction in large parts of the population in the way that not only the actions of the social elite, but his idea world, their Way OF Life, their culture are in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is largely as increasingly strange and more traditional. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The demand for Leadership that feed a tube branched but powerful movement of the withdrawal of the power of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unexpected “revolts” voter and the sudden reversal of the collective heart condition of the last time: beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, on the collapse of the labour party in Britain, for the uprising of the American members against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right here in Italy plays a part). </seg>
<seg id="26"> One wins the impression that the old elite, their parties, its programs, but its rites, magazines, intellectuals lender, has some people would say its format, more and more understanding problems and thus less representative worth about what is and is strengthened and driven up to about dimensionality from the financial crisis today in the lower social classes of the west. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In light of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a “uprising of the masses.” </seg>
<seg id="28"> But the eye to keep a wide open but it is certainly not. </seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="6"> So now “hybrid” Pdf files can also be generated by extending the typical diagram of Adobe format by the elements of a table and a text processing system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of applications: Tables can now more-handle by various Usern to be handled with conflicts have avoided when change; in the case of the text processing system Frabe is assigned to each editor to ensure better corrective action. </seg>

<seg id="11"> Following a request to be able to send the installation cds home or in the office. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> Meanwhile, if the freeness can be an incentive for the spread of the program in the private sector, it is precisely in the area of the Business, where the OpenOffice great success could manage: finally, already various mechanisms of public administration and schools switched to OpenOffice. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In fact, it is not even a lack of training offer, which means an optimal support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and even business prospects. </seg>
<seg id="14"> OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, " appropriate Texterstellungsprogram; The Calc Tabellenprogram aimed at a forced repatriation of Excel; Impress, for the production of presentations with Powerpoint; Dbase for the operation of databases, instead of the more well-known ACCESS; and last Draw a diagram modules. </seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the towns close their historic cinemas </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The historic cinemas close due to the beneficiary multiplex cinemas. </seg>
<seg id="3"> “A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.” </seg>
<seg id="4"> The image of the producer Giuseppe Tornatore describes in effect that currently in large urban areas of Italy, and also in the provinces, happens. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The process of the exclusion of cinemas, with the birth of the great multi-hall complexes in the periphery began, ultimately death chamber for a cinema in the center. A process that does not seem just inevitable and irrevocable, but also has the ability to a cultural crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Usually historical sites, full of memories, “it will look like a friend to be lost, with whom we have a piece of street full of emotion,” the producer of the film “Cinema Paradiso Nuovo” which brought in 20 years ago Oskar and the high price of Cannes for it. This is the story of a suburb of cinema and his nostalgia composed to live in a world of cinema lost forever. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The figures, which are the Anec, central trade association, provides a clear language: in the last five years, the huge amount of 316 traditional cinemas to close had; mostly cinemas in the large cities paid this bill: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The worst affected regions the Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely those three areas where the largest number of these modern cinemas was registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the state Lombardy lists 81 are both in Tuscany and Emilia Romagna. </seg>
<seg id="10"> “The business has in an irrational way developed” that Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, “it is useful for new structures, but in the first place is the preservation of the existing already because fills a warehouse in the city, is not all its regular customers to visit in place of an old multiplex cinema in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And even the lack of budget for the fund of trade association remains outside eight: the debt burden recorded by the state amounted to approximately 10 million. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a shame ethical-moral from the position that the government does not consider the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In order to preserve the sector would be between 16 and 18 million in the year of emergencies.” </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which decided because of fears for the old cinemas to protect these by an agreement between the community and the Anec is interesting; this is the first of its kind in Italy, which seeks to protect and support the traditional cinemas, both in the historic center, and in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Under the anticipated tax measures to give preference to the cinema operators and benefits to the public are on the transport: it will be allowed to go into the traffic-limited areas of central and also park to better parking fees. </seg>
<seg id="16"> “It is a good initiative” Giuseppe Tornatore, “I hope that our other towns, and will be followed by a new approaches to elaborate beyond that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> But there is no doubt that we need a better audio and video equipment, in order to be able to concentrate on the superpower the multiplex halls, because the public is now more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Defending the traditional cinema was always for me an important issue: the closure of the “Supercinema” of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the key point, which brought me to create the “Nuovo cinema Paradiso” even if I had already played for 10 years with the idea. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For 25 years I live in Rome; if I pass at the Rialto or at the Quirinale through in the Alliance, where I have seen so many different emotions, turning to the side, so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This would be the double energy currently generated by nuclear power plants. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, the currents and tides would come. </seg>

<seg id="10"> The first company, which is now on the sea energy is Enersis who signed a treaty in the year 2005 for the establishment of a power station in northern Portugal. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As this message appeared it was issued a revolutionary step. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Two years later, it is now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry, which number power production at the navy. </seg>
