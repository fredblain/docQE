Gebrselassie rested his world record suggests 
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown once again why some of them for the best long-distance runner of all time keep after it in the Berlin marathon on Sunday broke his own record and become the first man is the route of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 Hours and 4 minutes managed. 
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59 Gebrselassie has his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds improved the last year he had reached in Berlin. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has its 26th World record in his versatile career statements in which he at any distance of one kilometer marathon until at least one World Cup title is reached or has set a world record. 
Last month, Gebrselassie the Olympic marathon in Beijing omitted from fear, in retrospect perhaps exaggerated was that the pollution his asthma problems could worsen. 
Instead, he has to race in Berlin pending. 
In almost ideal conditions - when the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - has Gebrselassie with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile won. 
Since train runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed on long, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has increased by more than 2 minutes fallen since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06: 05 won. 
After his victory on Sunday Gebrselassie has informed the press that he had two weeks ago cramps in his calf and had therefore could not train one week. 
Obviously, he is refreshed after break and not come back rusty. 
"I'm so happy," he told reporters. 
"Everything has gone perfectly. 
I have the training a week ago and had resumed still some concerns, but in the end everything was great. " 
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia rivals from East Africa - that he heats his overly orchestrated, many of world's best marathon stars generally eschews themselves too much on the Rennanf√ºhrer leaves, as if the race would be a train, and world records on the race presents. 
But this criticism harms the size as long-distance runner Gebrselassie unlikely. 
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday Gebrselassie was the center of the line in 1:02:04 achieved. 
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi Gebrselassie still have challenges after the pace-maker had waned. 
Slightly more than three miles before the finish Gebrselassie has made his last inaugural to be separated from Kwambai who as second in 2:05:36 arrived and thus its best by almost 5 minutes has improved. 
Kamathi was third in 2:07:48. 
In women has Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, a remarkable year by the siebtschnellste with 2:19:19 outcome of all times has shown. 
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Britain. 
In last spring had the 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly the London Marathon in 2:24:14 won. 
It has missed games in Beijing, due to problems which were described back injury. But she recovered to win in Berlin and her best in her third marathon five minutes in order to improve. 
She has run its cleverly planned by a quartet from Ethiopian and Kenyan runners could only tear, but after 30 kilometers obsolete. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya third in 2:25:01 as arrived.
