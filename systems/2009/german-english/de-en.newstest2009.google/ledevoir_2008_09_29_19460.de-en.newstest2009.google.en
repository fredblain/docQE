Letters - A country dishonored 
Mr. Vic Toews,'Justiz' ex-minister (what irony) in the Cabinet, it was Harper, who last summer allowed, Louise Arbor on to say that she was a `disgrace 'for Canada. 
This woman, a never-ending struggle for justice has led and all deserve our admiration, then cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister around, how about Stephen Parker himself 
We are dealing here with a government to do, the only all of the countries concerned in their concentration camps of Guantanamo prisoners are not native has brought home. 
A government which does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager, when things happened to him be criticized. 
The only government which, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention has breaking their word and a child soldier under inhuman conditions can vegetate. 
The only one that is a parody of justice herabl√§sst to the guilt of the accused to assess. 
Call us remember that, especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers to plead, Omar Khadr home to fetch so he in Canada gets a fair trial. 
Exactly this government also closed its eyes to torture: There they are interested in little that a young adult, after so many years of torment certainly psychologically broken for ever will be. 
We are not yet aware of, but we are seeing here just an insidious curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our `democracy ', this word, the Harper constantly like a flag in front of her bears, and from his mouth as meaningless sounds. 
It is therefore the time has come where there is no morality anymore: You may use a Canadian citizen arbitrary abuse, torture and lock up, according to a government leaders discretion, to date only a minority supports it (may he after the October 14 quite belong to minority ...). 
Many voters believe that their salvation at a party to find the virtue, law and order preaches. But they do not see that this government is different from the losgesagt, which is the reputation and dignity of our country respectively. 
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
