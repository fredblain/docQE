Dark matter affects flight of space probes 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in Research for perplexity: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuvers. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein's not quite true could be. 
Nearly 18 years flew the spacecraft 'Ulysses' through space. 
Due soon freezing fuel lines, it is in danger now of KÃ¤ltetod. 
Among scientists ensures years a mysterious phenomenon for confusion - the swing-by anomaly. 
The swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, which she added momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth, will receive. 
This allows the probes much fuel savings. 
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this trick physical as well as the solar probe Ulysses. 
What the researchers however, have puzzled for years: The missiles are not behaving 100-percent, as it is after the venerable law of gravity would expect. 
Rather, there will be irregularities in speed. 
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower. 
So far, the physicists could not explain this effect. 
They baptized him swing-by anomaly. 
Some experts fear that perhaps the general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein, the attraction of matter by a curvature of space describes not quite true could be. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes firmly that Einstein was wrong not, and tries to swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter to explain the astronomers have identified in the universe. 
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which is also near the earth could find," he writes. 
Of the existence of dark matter of space researchers know only been around ten years. 
It is obviously an attraction, their effect on other celestial bodies can be observed. 
She herself is completely invisible, which means it transmits and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, in particular also no visible light. 
According to the calculations of scientists makes the dark matter still good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
