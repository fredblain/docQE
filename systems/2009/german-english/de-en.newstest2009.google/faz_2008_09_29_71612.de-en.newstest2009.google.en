Duesseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt 
At large lacks words in the letter of WestLB's board to the staff of the House not. 
Through a merging of units of the Düsseldorf bank with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank could be "the central banks of the House Capital Markets Financial Group" which says the known on Monday letter. 
WestLB would be a "competence bloc" with sustainable earnings power in such a business. 
And on such a connection is the decisive impetus to other lung Bünde in the Landesbank sector. 
To read it, if an executive at a difficult time to demonstrate ability to act. 
Because the ailing WestLB is still under enormous pressure. 
Not only from the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, the North Rhine-Westphalia state government recently has made clear that the time short, a future solution. 
As always, by a kind of liaison between the Deka-Bank, the savings for their customers know Investment Fund, and WestLB is, however, been some time since the speech - also on the Frankfurt side. 
Although Deka-Bank chief Franz Waas in the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August know, in a merger of the house at the Mainzer Landstrasse with a Landesbank, or approximately Helaba WestLB, he can see no sense. 
However, the Board of Deka, each half of the country's banks and savings associations is taken, the board instructed, with WestLB talks on joint activities to lead. 
This might be the capital markets business or parts of it go. 
The talks have admittedly, it is said the financial center, has only just begun. 
From the Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees on the major employers in the financial center of Frankfurt counts is not the first time the speech, when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector. 
2003, for a moment, it seems as could Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba merge. 
For this tripartite covenant, however, was nothing. 
No sooner were the plans became public, said the Hesse state government against a participation of Helaba them. 
The other two houses were then not each other. 
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart. 
But there have always been mind-games on a combination of the Deka-Bank country where banks. 
Recently, however, had Günther Merl, Chairman of Helaba, games against plan on a merger with pronounced his house. 
Regardless of which seems to mature recognition that a combination of the various houses backing of the public service sector need doing. 
Now that the state of Bavaria has passed, it could be the first to connect BayernLB with Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg closer. 
For Helaba is not necessarily good news. 
If the pressure for further mergers increase, going after her and after the partners in favor. 
In the south they would nurmehr junior partner, although the financial crisis so far has durchstanden much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A merger with West LB in turn, the Savings Bank and Giro Association Hesse-Thuringia, with 85 percent of Helaba is involved, the beginning of the year put an end to. 
Would remain if all the Nord LB. 
Such geostrategic considerations are only one side. 
On the other is about the question of how the different business models of individual houses fit. 
In June, said Merl, the crucial question of what business the future viability of the country's banks should be ensured, either by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association have not been answered. 
At the end could include a dismantling of West LB, which, however there obviously is not desired. 
That is because even in the letter of its Bureau which said it would in any case a "total solution" for the house sought. 
As with the combination of individual units with the Deka-Bank can bring a hat, will tell.
