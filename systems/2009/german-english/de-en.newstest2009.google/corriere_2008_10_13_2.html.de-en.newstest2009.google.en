Economics Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman 
The economy Prize is to the Americans Paul Krugman for his analysis of trading patterns and the location of economic activities. 
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer, at the University of Princeton and teaches known for his regular articles for The New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of economic and foreign policies of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had an editorial in the New York Times claimed that this second event was crucial for the history of the United States than the attacks. 
A prediction that not a little controversy as a response received and the economists have been accused years later, but now as a fully proven right. 
"I am surprised and shocked by how quickly the memory of the scandals under the collapses of Enron or Worldcom from the public view are gone," said Krugman end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi by the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank Krugman is an "economist of great value," but also trivialize with a "very aggressive style, especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration directed."
