BskyB loses plea in the case of ITV 
BSkyB has its lawsuit against the decision of the Competition Commission, its share in the rival broadcaster ITV to reduce lost. 
The Competition Appeal Court has ordered BSkyB, its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5% reduction. 
Previously, the Commission had alleged that the proportion BskyB distort competition and allows him an unfair influence on the channel ITV. 
BSkyB has its share in 2006, acquired by NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, successfully on the purchase of ITV has prevented. 
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported the purchase of the stake in ITV by BSkyB is preparing to doubt the independence of ITV, which the Competition Commission has encouraged an investigation to start. 
The Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Ofcom have pronounced against the purchase. 
BSkyB argued that its share of pressure to reduce ITV, was an unreasonable and excessive action, particularly because BSkyB announced its voting rights to want to abandon.
