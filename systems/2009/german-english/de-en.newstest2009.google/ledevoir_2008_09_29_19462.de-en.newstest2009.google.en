Freedom of expression - The orwellsche speech by Barrick Gold 
In its edition of 17 Le Devoir in September a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Assistant Director-General of Canada's Barrick Gold mine gold. 
This confirmed and pursued a orwellsche logic that the largest gold mining company in the world, a libel action over six million against three authors and a small publishing house without resources aspired, with the goal of a `transparent public debate 'to open. 
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, then they do not have to judge the truth, especially in the case of defamation lawsuits, but about the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference was made by Mr. Garver totally ignored. 
Because for Barrick Gold is the best way to a public debate, everyone in the ruin to drive, the dares, one of their opposing views to represent. 
No matter how the process runs out, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight, from the pockets of the almost inexhaustible gold mine to be paid . 
The tactics in this unequal battle is also often the defenders to ruin a friendly regime in order to force the opposite side silenced and also makes every deter dares to revisit the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, they would have their view of things in front of public opinion must be present. 
Contrary to what many of the countries in which Barrick Gold operates, and there is access, are in Canada debates usually through the exchange of ideas and not by truncheon blows out. 
It would therefore suffice if the goldmine their books and records and disclosed a real debate had opened, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent auditing, which shed light on this question would bring. 
But Barrick Gold appears no confidence in the public opinion and whisks the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand motion aside. 
Could perhaps explain Mr. Garver, as he simultaneously to a `public 'debate may ask and yet the views of these public disregard? 
Apparently, this word in the world of the Vice President only generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians, a pretty narrow view of the concept. 
In a democracy itself slanderers have the right to speak. 
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or will not understand - is that the public, the authors and publisher of Canada supports Noir, it does so mainly because they are the brutal attitude of gold declines. 
These public is ready to listen and to Barrick judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a frame, as many perceive Gag-action (during the `public debate 'Barrick Gold currently has an exposure to The authors of Noir Canada addressed in which they demanded of them, this concept no longer use ...). 
Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, is the plea from Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth, which is essential for any democratic society. 
They completely deny the right to quote from credible sources and facts and interpretations to discuss the basis of intellectual work. 
If it works in a country like Canada is impossible, themes to explore and discuss the range of companies in this world do not like who else can do? 
If Barrick Gold really a public and transparent debate wanted, they could lead by the scientific standards followed by the authors of Noir Canada were used. 
She has a right to respond. 
The university environment to which we belong, has long, debates and disagreements to grips with and conflicts to resolve. 
The disproportionate action by Barrick Gold shows clearly that, in contrast to what she pretends not to want to have a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate, and it is time that governments take measures to this type of unjustified actions limit.
