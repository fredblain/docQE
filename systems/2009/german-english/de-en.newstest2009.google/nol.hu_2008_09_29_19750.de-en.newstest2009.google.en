CSU: grace period to 
At the end of October is about the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein decided 
Despite the election debacle roll meanwhile still no heads, at the head of the Bavarian CSU staff debates were postponed. 
Party chief and Prime Minister Erwin Huber Beckstein remain in their offices, the only question is how long this lasts grace. 
About the fate of the duo after the disastrous 17-percent loss will vote on the last weekend in October at the extraordinary party congress decided. 
The much gescholtene duo had already imply that it is not glued to their armchairs wish. 
So they want to be the angry group and placate the party base, a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of an absolute majority demanded personal consequences. 
Five years ago - admitted that under the leadership of the climax of his career following Edmund Stoiber - reached the Christian Social Union still 60.7 percent. Now, however, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, they could only 43.4 percent of the votes secure. 
The CSU was 46 years lang 'Alleinregierer "in Bavaria, the 18 percent of German GDP. 
The Conservatives remain the dominant force in the well for the Hungarian economy important southern province, but will in future need a coalition to govern. 
The first sign of partisan internal restructuring is the potential successor Huber, vice president and federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer also in the exploration team involved with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "liberal voters" exploratory talks about a possible coalition Munich leads. 
One irony of fate is equal to that list of "Free voters" those Gabriele Pauli in the legislature comes into it, whose anti-Stoiber occurrence of the Huber-Beckstein duo first utilized in order to then-minded politician abzuservieren mercilessly. 
The CSU leadership now concentrated all its forces to stabilize Beckstein. 
In this transition process will Stoiber, the date the threads from the background attracted an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called 28 September "day of its bitterest political career." 
On Monday Huber made a few remarks in the direction of toxic CDU - in his view, the CSU had far more support from the sister party deserves. 
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel. 
If the CSU in 2005 and at national level, much success has helped, not with a joint effort back on the footing can be Merkel after the Bundestag elections in September 2009 not to be chancellor again. 
Merkel, who made their disappointment over the fiasco has made no secret, believes that the loss terrain of the CSU will not adversely affect the grand coalition in Berlin impact. 
What, however, is relatively: The wounded CSU is not easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats, however, goes further. 
With 18.6 percent reached the SPD its best result so far in Bavaria since 1946.
