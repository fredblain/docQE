Nevertheless, it is even for experienced taxi driver and longtime residents difficult to say where the extra place is located, simply because most have never heard of. 
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street northbound between Bowery and Second Avenue, without the Second Street to reach. 
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty lane as actively used after a passage from street. 
There is also no street signs. 
It is practically impossible for them to a standard road map to find. 
This road has yet their admirers. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently luxury building on First Street has built. 
It wants extra Place new paving, to a clean passage to the shops and boutiques, in the new buildings are expected to create.

Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the road in the hands of the city remains, and has prompted a new plan in the next month will be submitted to Susan Stetzer, district manager in the municipal 3rd 
"Very little space is owned by the city stayed and we want to continue Extra Place is one of the city," she said. 
"It could give offerings, how to repair the road and operates what could be done Avalon, but we also want the public access remains guaranteed." 
Avalon Bay has announced several months ago, the small street paving and new seats set up, inter alia, for a cafe are thought to which the company wants to rent space. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street, was the first time during the meeting this month made public.

"The main concern of Avalon Bay, it is these renovate dilapidated alley and a public meeting to make," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Buildings Department for Protection said that it was indeed the desire of the town been selling the street, and stressed the role of the department it was more likely to develop the property than to manage. 
Compared with its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, has something extra Place of its historical impression retained. 
Some believe that the name of their street in 1802 has received, as a large farm, which belonged to Philip Minthorne, among his numerous children and a close strip of land was never claimed. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which in 2006 was closed, opened to extra Place and the road is certainly the most famous as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones. 
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, the photo in November 1976 had made. 
The street was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, newsletters and ropes. 
Some residents, including bloggers who have the gentrification of the East Village to write, the idea of selling extra Place refused, arguing that this public land, as modest as it is to continue to remain publicly. 
Others have extra Place praised as a rarity - a virtually unchanged factions of the city, the rest should be allowed.

With few exceptions, the road just as recently at a ausgesehen evening. 
A rat ran through the rear portion of the street, not far from the door, which previously led to CBGB, where today a more expensive apparel business is located. 
Graffiti on the walls were visible, and an empty beer bottle lay on the ground not far from a fresh set of discarded newspapers. 
Some passersby said they had rarely have extra Place thought, but suggested that the road could be somewhat refurbished. 
Fields, adding that after his opinion, some people the thrill of the road in its current state underestimated. 
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that are dark, damp and were disgusting.
