The debate about bilingual education: education in English-speaking environment 
In this edition of the "Education Watch" discuss Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi, the positions of the candidates for bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, senior research associate in Kalifonischen studies and executive director in the Department of Education Studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice." 
The Hispanic voters to be addressed is a complicated task. 
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example. 
Obama's campaign noted that "the probability of Afro-American and Hispanic students to school successfully, is lower than for white students" - what is wrong. 
To this performance gap to close, we recommend Obama's education plan, especially among others a transition phase in bilingual education for those who learn English only. 
However, there is a question for Obama is whether its use for bilingual education, focusing on education in languages other than English sets, contrary to his interest, the gap in the school to reduce benefits. 
Take for example "Sixth Street Prep," a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. 
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from families with low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country to learn English. 
Nevertheless, in 2008 astonishing 100 percent of fourth grade students the state test in math at a good level existed. 
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school in the English test than good. 
This amazing success was achieved by other methods than those which are favored Obama. 
The school Sixth Street presents its emphasis on reviewing and exercise, to steady control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions. 
In addition, the school practiced the approach, after training in an English-speaking environment runs. This is precisely the point that Obama should be noted, says the head teacher Linda Mikel. 
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in specialized classes. 
Ms. Mikel, the idea of bilingual education declines, said to me, the school would have been a remarkable success with a student who only shortly before had come from Mexico. 12 months later, you would enter the classroom and it no longer can recognize. 
"It works," she remarked that "it works for us." 
Obama would be a school such as the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other students are learning English? 
The benefits of the school would be the answer to this question lightly, but the educational policy positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time the idea of bilingual education) and its consistent support for bilingual education to make predictions about Obama's uncertain response. 
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivializes the issue, he remarked that people should cease to worry about the "English only" legislation aiming to make. 
Instead, he said: "They should make sure that your child may be Spanish." 
If Obama the performance gap really want to close, he should carefully consider educational models that work, rather than despise and to trivialize.
