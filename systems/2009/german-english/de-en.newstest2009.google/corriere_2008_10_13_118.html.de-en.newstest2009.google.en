The super glue, which can go up walls 
The forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive to defeat and highly walls climb to as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which is now apparently almost at the destination is. 
With an area of only 2.5 qcm applied glue, it is the researchers succeeded in a 100 kg body on a vertical wall to fix. 
STUDIO - an American magazine has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory published. 
The team of researchers from the invented material is a development of the glues used already, what a special carbon structure, known as carbon nanotubes, use. 
"The principle of the glue can be like a series on a stack arranged spaghetti tubes imagine," said Zhong Lin Wang from Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists have developed from the feet of geckos inspiration, which are microscopic hairs covering the animal give a perfect stop. 
The various materials such as Teflon and glass sand tests have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more than the ability to hold the feet of reptiles and at the same time "from the wall easily remove it," said Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering Sciences of the University of Dayton. 
WALLS TO ENTLANGWANDERN? "This material could be used as a glue used perishable," continues Liming Dai added. 
Around the walls like Spiderman to emporzugehen? Perhaps already, but the researchers think more to a less fascinating benefits, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also directors of heat and electricity. 
Other application areas could be in the field of aerospace fall. 
For the moment, the superhero is still waiting. 
THE OTHER KIND OF RESEARCH - including the University of Berkeley, California, dedicated to a new Kleberart. 
In an article in the American Chemical Society will present the Californian scientists glue from the micro-fibers like hair by movement on a surface cleanse themselves from dust and therefore always a perfect liability coverage.
