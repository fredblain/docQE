Sylvana and the mysteries of the Bento Box 
As Hiltrop Sylvana, 16, on the first school day at the Tachibana High imagine to catch on to the girls giggle: The German is totally "Kawaii"! 
What that means? 
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange-log tells them from Japan. 
"The first day of school in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Even before school, I had Bammel. 
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in Kawasaki and leaving 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School. 
The way I had to find alone, fortunately, I have not lost. 
The lessons start at Tachibana seems not so strictly defined as at our home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils from the age of eight spin clock, until eight forty to a brief round meeting with the teacher begins, the 'home room'. 
But before the lesson began, I was in the series, introduce myself. 
I am not the guy who likes to speak before the people, even before a class of 40 students. 
Because I still had no school uniform, I have an old rock my host mother dressed, this blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes. 
In this elevator I was before the lectern and tried everything right out: 'Where she Sayonara Sylvana ...' - My name is Sylvana, come from Germany and had birthday in a week. 
At the moment, I was very glad that I had a good two years before starting had to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class have all getuschelt, gekichert and gewunken and I constantly have the word "Kawaii" belongs. 
That I already knew from my manga. 
It belongs to Ã¼berlebenswichtigen vocabulary of Japanese girls and means' cute, sweet '. 
Then I quickly to my place gehuscht. 
The girl next to me has pretty broad gegrinst, they thought it was an honor that the exchange student should sit beside her. 
The rest of the day was fairly quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was downright assails. 
All spoke up and asked me kicherten and holes in the abdomen - it is really difficult to understand Japanese to English. 
In the break then grabbed all of their Bentos. 
My host mother had me as a Lunchbox made - that is something other than the desolate German break bread. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumber and seaweed, fruit and meat in a kind Tofumantel. 
Mostly, I have no foggiest exactly what I eat here in Japan. 
The odd things to see and taste completely novel. 
It is clear that everything is really tasty. 
Well, up to the salty preserved plums, perhaps, brrrr! 
The Bentos at Japanese schools are not just lunch. 
It sometimes requires that a girl a boy a self-prepared bento gift, which they then herrichtet particularly artful - in the hope that the boys at the snack closer to learn. 
I like this in my manga comics to read. 
I'm anxious times, if I can watch here. 
'Why is precisely because Japan?', My friends have asked me when I told them that I for one year in Tokyo wants to go to school. 
I've always said: 
"Because I am fascinated times now." 
Finally, I read many years favorite manga. 
And so I comics and the culture is better understood, I have also begun sometime, a bit to learn Japanese. 
So for me it was quite clear that I eventually had to stay here. 
Because I have a penchant for tradition, customs and traditions. 
And the people attach great importance here. 
Japan is one country the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well organized, I am also not yet felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen. "
