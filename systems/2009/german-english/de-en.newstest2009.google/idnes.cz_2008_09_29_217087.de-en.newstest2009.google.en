The first virtual providers already this year after the Czech Republic. 
Maybe 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is fairly mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they also by their counterparts in Western Europe are offered. 
Yet something is missing here - a virtual providers, the traditional forces to lower prices. 
Maybe it will not be long in coming. 
That the Czech mobile provider to the most expensive in Europe at work, we have often reported on Mobil.cz. 
This also confirmed the Telecommunications Authority CTU, the attention made that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union. 
After the final steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges is likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators will SMS from abroad cheaper than at home. 
How is it that the prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe are so high? 
The answer is simple, it's missing the competition, which really makes a challenge. 
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of more than 100%. 
The mobile provider rant on the other hand, likes the fact that it is on the Czech market very much competition. 
The shares are often also the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (CTU), Pavel Dvorak, when, in the past had often expressed that there is no place in the Czech Republic for another supplier admit. 
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network no longer has very many opportunities (Incidentally, he would probably barely find frequencies). 
But there is still a possibility - a virtual manufacturer. 
Especially the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market saw a significant price reduction with him, then also on the traditional mobile service provider had to react. 
There were even before the entry of such companies such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain as similar votes in the Czech Republic. 
It has however shown that there is space for such providers and that they really can be successful. 
Incidentally, one need not long after to find examples. 
In February of this we have on the launch of the virtual mobile operator in Poland, King reported. 
In just half a year, this supplier, more than 100 thousand customers to win and so on the fifth of the country aufzusteigen providers. 
Mobil King stands behind the financial group Penta, in the Czech Republic, inter alia, U: fon owns. 
The advantage consists of virtual providers is that you're on a much more specific audience can concentrate. 
To function effectively, you need virtual service providers to give customers much less than a classic manufacturer. 
You do not need relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In the world profile as the virtual providers usually as a low-cost firms out - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, but often from a less extensive service offering is accompanied. 
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile SMS in Britain at least half cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as the example of Mobil King in Poland shows it may also be a good move, to a non-stereotyped target set. 
These providers is directed specifically at men. 
"Real men choose Mobil King - the providers, they like and they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider. 
Hard to say whether a similar approach as in Poland and the Czech Republic could gain a foothold. 
Any doubt of the Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is a market segment, on which most virtual operators are based, relatively small. 
He is also from the viewpoint of the services offered relatively saturated. " 
In the Czech Republic a chance, my mobile provider 
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile service provider Czech Republic conquered, this is not King will be mobile. 
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic to see the negotiations not very hopeful from. 
It is befitting a king of mobile market in other countries of our region ", says in a telephone interview for Jana Mobil.cz Studničková, Spokesperson of the financial group Penta. 
Indirectly confirmed it so that the current mobile provider in the Czech Republic this idea does not subscribe. 
On the contrary, they try everything to do with the fact that no potential competitor arises. 
Your interest in starting a virtual mobile provider showed a long time since the group GTS Novera, a further step the company wants to create a real competitor to Telefonica O2 in the corporate sector to be. 
"We have a great interest to our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services. 
And the sooner the better. 
About this possibility we have repeated with all Czech mobile operators negotiated. 
With some of them we could already negotiating progress, "said the spokesman of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps now better times. 
From unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider, perhaps by the end of the year is unlikely. 
So far, but this is from an insurmountable wall of silence surrounded. 
"In this moment we do not assume that in the Czech Republic Square for a full-fledged virtual manufacturer exists. 
The Czech market is large compared to other markets on specifics. 
So far, we have no subject with a complex and serious project in this area addressed, "says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefonica O2. 
On the specifics of the Czech market also other suppliers out. 
The press spokeswoman for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds rare in accordance with the Declaration of O2 added: "So far we have not yet viable on both sides and beneficial project found, at which one could build further." 
And she adds: "In the network of T-Mobile until the end of the year, hardly a provider of virtual history. 
At this moment we already have a concrete offer have available, so as to be able to think short term. " 
Vodafone directed its attention more on the fulfillment of the requirements of its own 3G license. 
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure. 
We consider this just from the perspective of customers as the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile Internet. " 
The responsible authorities - with suppliers hand in hand 
The approach of the mobile provider is easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, this would result in lower prices and thereby also to a decline in profits. 
So why such a facilitate the entry of competitors? 
That the manufacturer to pull it if it goes to something also evident from the long back and forth to the emergence of U: fon. 
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of CTU went to the time when U: fon on the market came from the company from T-Mobile. 
The show also publicly available information from the CTU's websites. 
But now is precisely U: fon as an argument why a virtual providers should not allow. 
Kemrová Martina said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further exacerbated by the entry of a fourth mobile provider strengthened. 
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic is obvious that a new player in the market itself, and especially its services would put heavy demands. " 
Given this approach of the mobile provider puzzled, however, the absolute Disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities. 
It is not just about the attitude of the CTU, the Czech unfortunately - in contrast to Britain and other highly developed countries - has not the competence in economic competition to intervene. 
This has solely by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS). 
But this was about this issue throughout his typical attitude. 
"The entry of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible once there is a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual vendor on renting the necessary infrastructure has come. 
So far, no such agreement, because the offer was probably interested potential for the traditional providers are not sufficiently interesting, "said in his reply to our request Kristian Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS. 
By representatives of providers such a formulation would not be surprised. 
From a public authority, which represented the interests of consumers and others should make sure that nobody's position on the market abuse, this is more than questionable. 
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual operators are working quite normal, it is observed that their entry to a reduction in mobile phone services has contributed." 
But probably belong to the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price not to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
Really shocking about this case is almost touching the line of the three mobile service providers, of their responses follows. 
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, is obvious. 
Just as the very same gasoline at the pump certainly only a coincidence and the result of a fight is tough competition. 
"The authority in this case discovered no evidence that an anti-competitive behavior directed suggest, and therefore it has no reason to any kind in the matter. 
None of the supplier has a dominant market position, so he also has not increased the responsibility for his actions on the market. 
The necessary tools for opening up the market for mobile virtual operators are missing probably also the regulator for telecommunications, "said Chalupa, in its declaration. 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious points. 
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets, prepared by the CTU, after the telecommunications from the perspective of economic competition is a single market. 
In such a market, then of course none of the Czech mobile provider a dominant position. 
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - for the entry of a virtual provider is always the consent of the operator is required. 
And the mobile provider has - logically - for his network's monopoly. 
Which means that he is in a certain segment necessarily a dominant position. 
Even if you but with this argument is not mitgeht, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three mobile service providers strikingly similar way. 
These complaints show a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera), that they are in negotiations with all suppliers in a very similar obstacles. 
The shifting of responsibility to the CTU is in the telecommunications services is a fairly usual trick with which the ÚOHS from the whole affair distances. 
This was already in some similar cases to observe. 
Unfortunately, it did not succeed in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act extending the powers of the CTU to the field of economic competition in the telecommunications enforce, although a number of professionals including an improvement in the situation had promised. 
The representatives must ÚOHS know only too well, but they probably have other interests. 
It is already, if nobody look 
Ignored once the functioning of any pseudovirtueller suppliers from which it is in the Czech mobile networks are more equal. 
There are companies that own price lists for mobile telecommunications services spending, but only partly public. 
Normally it is namely to firms involved in multi-level marketing act. 
My mobile phone services, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Star Life and others. 
The price of these companies usually only get to elect. 
The joke of the matter is that the firm towards the operator as a classical corporate client occurs, a large quantity of SIM cards ordered. 
As an important customer receives it then special price offers (and other offers). 
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile provider a similar kind of resale ban. 
"Should there be cases that you describe, then it is a breach of contractual conditions act with which we will employ, resulting in a termination of cooperation with the relevant society can lead," Martina replied to our question Kemrová about this issue. 
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing when the leaders of the mobile provider not herumspricht. 
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies can take thousands of clients. 
No operator is opposed to such an approach, however. 
From the activities of these companies that they are not negligible gains, while they - in contrast to the actual virtual providers - not by the actual official marketing impaired. 
To potential problems makes Miroslav Čepický attention: "The law allows such kind of speculation, despite all the services of these companies only by a very small percentage of customers. 
They must also accept that the SIM card in your phone does not run on their behalf, they can not fully have about how the ordinary customers of mobile service providers. " 
Alone, but the CTU should occur at least strange. 
In addition opens up another question for the ÚOHS. 
Sealing the mobile service providers such an approach before their eyes, why they lock themselves against a virtual provider? 
It should be added that the ÚOHS to detect such activities fairly strong powers, and if it does not want, it does not interfere with the Declaration of the providers, they knew nothing about it and its terms and conditions that would prohibit satisfied. 
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive is 
As the text has already been stressed repeatedly brought the entry of virtual operators a significant price decline for the various services themselves. 
They have practically in all countries where virtual operators have emerged, the traditional provider tries, whose emergence of virtually more or less to prevent. 
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - a too small or too much saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
In highly developed countries but accessed precisely in those moments regulatory bodies, which can not protect the interests of mobile service providers, but those of their customers tried to maintain. 
Whether through formal or non-action pressure, they reached that the first virtual operators emerged, and this was followed by others. 
Unfortunately throw the Czech regulatory bodies throughout the case like a hot potato. 
Based on our experience, we can not discard the impression that ambiguity in the competencies in these cases is more than favorable. 
But let us not into the shotgun grain. 
When the background information is correct, and soon a virtual provider arises, will the Czech mobile market may soon set in motion. 
If a provider the emergence of a virtual mobile service provider allows, the ÚOHS not remain idle when it comes to other interested parties refuse (to discriminate). 
And the Czechs are then finally no more expensive phone than the rest of Europe.
