About the psychology of the bidding - or why we are prepared to pay more 
At the auction buyers tend to spend more and thus offered for sale to overestimate. 
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York is now succeeded in the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior to discover. 
According to the "Science" magazine published study that people want in a competition like an auction on eBay, not beaten, and are therefore willing, even to pay excessive prices. 
The researchers have tried to schedule the neurological this "game" with experimental auctions to explore. 
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the others attended a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of subjects using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) investigated. 
In both games, participants could win money, however, an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, losers in the auction measured in the bidding over the opponent plays a major role. 
Among many other functions, this brain region for the "self reward" of the nervous system responsible. 
The researchers believed, therefore, the price could be achieved by avoiding an over-reaction of the striatum explain. 
To her thesis to underpin the economists in the research group studies in addition to tracking the money employed. 
In this case, three groups against a partner under different conditions bid. 
The control group was the true value of the product indicated, then they have made their bets. 
Another group were also 15 U.S. dollars reward promised in the event that they are winners from the game show. 
The third group received 15 U.S. dollars before the auction, in the event of a lost game also were lost. 
The difference between the two groups existed only so that the emphasis at the one on the gains, while the other was on the losing. 
As evidence for the hypothesis neurologists were expressed but the members of the "Losing against" playing group to higher operations prepared than those in the control or the "profit" group. 
"These results can be from any previous economic theory derived. 
These have the observed behavior in auctions only with the joy of winning, or the risk avoidance reasons. 
The contradiction between these two theories was due to neurological imaging methods dissolved, so we are now a third statement to have "- said Andrew gravel, a professor of economics faculty of the University of New York.
