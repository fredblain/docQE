Intelligent car mimics the flight of the bumble bee 
What would be the best way to develop new technologies for accident prevention, if not the obstacle sensors from nature to imitate? 
For example, the bees. 
At CEATEC in Japan was an amazing project presented at the Nissan engineers of bumblebees in the creation of new accident avoidance systems were inspired. 
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo has the Nissan car biomimetic robots controlled system of the type BR23C built a mini-car, equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim to develop a system to support that avoids any collisions. 
In flight each bee makes its own oval "private sector", of our own "shield" is very similar, said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development at the exhibition. 
The compound eye of the bee, in any direction and at an angle of 300 degrees can see, play an important role. 
To investigate the function of the compound eye imitate the researchers attacked the idea of the laser distance meter on. 
This identifies obstacles before BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees within 2 meters calculated their distance and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately kollisionsvermeidenden process. 
The obstacle is in fractions of a second registered car and the robot immediately change course, similar to the movement of bees by the tires at the appropriate angle turns. 
Unlike existing systems, this maneuver rather than a purely instinctive. 
"If it were not the case, the car robots could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the robot car project. 
The system must react instinctively and immediately, because this technology is the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield represents - a shift within the accidents are still valid as inevitable. 
The entire process must be the behavior of bees reflect, when they dodge other bees. 
And this must be a fraction of a second run. 
However, the evasive action, in contrast to the bees, not up, down or diagonally done - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the applicability of the tires. 
While the bees are an infinite number of possibilities open to other bees avoid, the researchers were able to robotic car only when the rotational movement, or the Accel and decel operate. 
The BR23C contains lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium-ion batteries. 
Andoh said, it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to save. 
This device must per second just a few inputs to process and respond to them accordingly. 
It must not store or on the basis of previous maneuvers an intuitive, logical reaction to produce, so keep it just a handful of KB Memory takes. 
There is no need for megabytes and gigabytes-heavy memories. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, according to estimates from Nissan within the next ten years standard in production will be. 
Another application could be the technology in the GPS satellite navigation can be found by motorists deliberately steers around obstacles and so it leads to your destination.
