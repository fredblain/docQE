Microsoft on the lookout for one (virtual) receptionist 
On the `Emerging Technology Conference, organized by MIT, Microsoft has the progress of the new image recognition system and the human-interaction presented a creature of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but which is capable of some primitive tasks, such as a Taxi ordering (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route to get on the campus of the company to move). The system attends to what it hears during the entertainment. 
Thanks to a camera and a shape and facial recognition system, it can `receptionist 'to see how many people in the room are who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and the key words to understand their entertainment. 
It may also present after the talks in the lane groups. 
In the video presentation noticed the receptionist ` 'a third person, but she understands that this person in the group with the conversation with her lead, not to belong, and that no company employee is. 
She asks whether the person here who wants to visit and replied that they soon will listen. 
All without the blue screen shot 
Impressive 
That is certainly the future. 
Now the company has better things to which it can concentrate, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system. 
This week we talked about the very superficial change of strategy by Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be faster and not so many embedded applications. 
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computer with the necessary equipment would instead with the commercial garbage to fill, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, it will only be for the few. 
Everything is just a finding, if one considers that Microsoft Windows versions of one or another function and `extras' inflicted. 
The change of direction is worthwhile 
Microsoft has the right to the operating system gradually loses in importance, just like the software. 
As a Google chromium appeared on the network, was a part of the theory that it is the first step by Google in order to compete with Windows. 
Many had cleverly pointed out that the browser is not operating. 
The operating system as an indispensable part, will always be necessary, so that hardware and software can function simultaneously. 
The operating system fulfills the role, function with his wife or his spouse can be compared when it comes to tell his mother anything. 
That's true. 
The system will never disappear, but you must be connected to his `death ', not as an absolute but as relative truth, think. 
What Ballmer this week said, is the confirmation of this idea. 
The people give less attention each time the operating system, but more the Web browser. 
The computer will only start to Firefox, Explorer or the chrome and execute every day we spend more time surfing than in the vicinity of the `window '. 
What is the half of existing applications in the computer? 
Less is more 
And Windows compact 7 Must be much more compact than Vista. 
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated. 
The interest of Microsoft's more there is to its online services to integrate, then, finally, the alternative may be to Google. 
In reality they need, without a doubt. I bring a small example. 
The photo of this place I have in Redmond, in a recreation room for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month made. 
On the soft drink machine is a sign attached: `Your Search. Our future '. It prints a request from its own tool for online search to use. 
In 2006 came an independent study concludes that 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google searches for the network used. 
Incidentally, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 in the delay is advised. 
It will not start, but the end of 2009 appear even more likely 2010. 
Microsoft is looking at the possibility, Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously in the market to bring. 
Every day turns the phone into a computer. 
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
