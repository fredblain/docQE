Even rats have feelings 
A rat or a cockroach flees when danger is that it also feels fear? 
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced, too many animals have feelings. 
But how could we check whether they feel the same if they are similar to how we behave? 
In the Internet magazine "Edge" have been used for several years, contributions of famous scientists published. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected in a series of answers to the question "What do you think are true, prove it without them?" 
I believe that animals sensations and other states of consciousness, without that I or anyone else that could yet prove where we can not even prove that other people have consciousness. 
But in this case, at least we hope, because all human brains same basic configuration. 
But when we turn to other species and issues of feeling or, more generally, of consciousness touch, we enter the roughest terrain, because the hardware does not match. 
When a rat in danger, she is doing the same as many other animals: it is dead, escapes or attacks. 
People behave similarly, leading some scientists to a similar close subjective experience. 
I think it does not. 
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult, our subjective experience of animals to be transferred. 
On the one almost always conclude with the human consciousness associated circuitry the lateral prefrontal cortex one (because of his involvement in the short-term memory and the execution / control functions). 
This broad region in humans is much higher than in the other primates and other creatures seem to be missing entirely. 
At least for those aspects of our consciousness, the prefrontal cortex depend, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, therefore consists reason to believe that the man even from the other primates differs. 
Another dramatic feature is expected in the linguistic nature of humans is: Because such a large part of his experience with language, are often the consciousness depends on it. 
In this case, one could exclude animals. 
But even if not consciousness of language abhinge, this would certainly affect it so that animal consciousness, as might be set up, probably very different from most of our states of consciousness differences. 
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness in other animals look like. 
If it is, as something internal and subjective, yet neither measure because of the specific hardware, using our own experience, analyze it, it makes us his research with great problems. 
Most of my remarks refer to the contents of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, science should be easily accessible. 
One could sense the processes of animals without regard to their contents examined, and that is exactly what happens in studies of the short-term memory of primates, in particular the example of visualization. 
But in this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick went after, we moved more on the neural correlates of consciousness as to the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical or not. 
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the Formation of visualization. 
What is now responsible for the sensations? 
I'll do it due to the fact that an emotional system such as the fear in one of his own conscious brain activity is activated. 
What we call "fear" described, is the mental state in which we find ourselves, if the activity of the brain localized defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) memory occupied. 
Seen sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex bound, the primates, and especially the people excel. 
Linked to the linguistic nature are subtle gradations of feeling, because we are using the words and grammar states can differentiate and categorize, in addition to ourselves and others attributed. 
By contrast, says Antonio Damasio, for example, that feelings of primitive activities in the regions of the body feeling and the cerebral cortex tribal Jaak Pankseep show similar, but the more focused on the brainstem. 
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed, it could mean that cross-species sensations involved. 
Theoretically, I can not contradict, however, think it unprovable. 
Pankseep argues, what in rats and humans appear as fear, probably also felt in both cases so: But how can you verify that rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly? 
A cockroach flees at risk whether they felt fear? 
In my eyes can conduct simple similarity does not prove experiencing equality. 
While helping the neural comparison further rats and humans have similar brain tribes, cockroaches are not even a brain. 
But the brainstem is responsible for sensation? 
And even if this could prove to the people: How would you prove it in rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), Have feelings. 
But I do not know how I should prove. 
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours differ (as the human consciousness in specific circuits and is based on language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats. 
If any progress here winking at the neural level, if we in rats and humans the same measure. 
I like language and consciousness does not explore in rats, it is not feelings, but I do not know whether they exist. 
One may hold intended for short-sighted, but I prefer to come forward, as ever against a wall to run. 
I'm just a practical Emotionalist.
