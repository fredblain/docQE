The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had already been a few days ago revealed as the Chamber of Deputies against 700 billion-dollar savings of the White House agreed: One large part of the Americans was and is more interested in Wall Street to punish than to save the economy. 
This confirms yesterday's edition of The New York Times, which reported how the crisis over step divides the Republican Party, which is increasingly splitting into their old and moderate East Coast soul, always state institutions and the business community and beneficiary those neoconservative, the "where Washington and the financial world is hostile and mainly in the south and the center of the states voters. 
This part of the party owes its rise above the voice of his that I mentioned above. 
This example just mentioned, however, is only a small part of the great changes that the current economic earthquake, or even already announcing itself: not only in the U.S., even throughout the West and perhaps even beyond will be affected by this. 
Both in the states as well as in Europe seems to be the long-feared crisis to speed events, which under these new conditions finally take shape and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy. 
In fact, the crisis means a decline of the banking and financial institutions, which has close links to foreign countries and also possess a tremendous amount of assets managed by private households, which in a single state resident. 
This means an immediate political problem for governments: namely, how it compared to the affected families is to behave, which is also an enormous mass of voters. 
The crisis appears so globally economically, politically, on the other hand, it is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems to be in the sidelines to his speech and his right to have lost: The evidence for this is obvious from the EU to pursue that because of their division into various national and international conflicts no common way to find white. 
Therefore, all now reckon with the intervention of the state; rescue plans, new rules, and especially distribution of relief funds: Since the crisis was always serious, only the United States in the economic situation without foreign help to rescue. 
And in addition to the resources they have also the legitimacy to use them: hence two not to be judgmental about conditions - under certain circumstances - which probably no other international organization and no market in a similar way can draw is. 
That new emphasis on the state-national element will be paid in the rest is in perfect harmony with the growing importance that recently in the economy with a closely related sector is brought in connection: the territoriality. 
Paradoxical way, it is precisely now, when we are so convinced were long in a networked total occurred realm to be in a realm of increasingly sophisticated technology, the intangible that we once observed, as our future but more and more of the essential material things will depend on: water, crop and oil. 
This can certainly all from one place to another in the world are transported, but are nevertheless extremely narrowly circumscribed with a piece of ground - a territory. 
It is the one who possesses such a territory has, over another, in a yield-free, water-free or oil-free area lives in advantage. 
I come now to the second novelty, but a short slot requires. 
Who Territory, who Government, who Policy says, says hence leadership. 
In this sense, it seems that the financial crisis two converging phenomena to produce. 
One is awareness of the need Leaderships respected, so the need for someone who knows how to get things in place. 
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing tours, especially those of the economy, which is considered inadequate and full of shadow zones have turned. 
Moreover, finally, a deep-reaching and in some ways even more worrying aspect: A loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of Unzweckmäßigkeit, a feeling of distance, all on a whole class of managers of the Western countries targeted. 
It seems to be the conviction among large segments of the population the way for motorways, that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but their idea world, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whether, whose salary is the Majority as always alien and Overturning represents. 
The demand for leadership nourishes So a branched underground but powerful movement of the disempowerment of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unexpected "revolts" in the electorate and the sudden reversal of the collective state of mind lately: starting with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, on the collapse of the Labor Party in Britain, towards the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the Right in Italy a role here). 
One gets the impression, as did the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectuals creditors, some would say their format, with more understanding of problems and therefore less representative value regarding what today in the lower social strata of the West is going on and from the financial crisis exacerbated and to Überdimensionalität driven. 
Given all this, it would be quite an exaggeration, of a "rebellion of the masses" to speak. 
The eyes wide open but to keep it safe, however, is not.
