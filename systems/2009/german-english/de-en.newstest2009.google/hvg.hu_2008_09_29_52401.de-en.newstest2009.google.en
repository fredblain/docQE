Believers have less pain? 
As the latest research results show that the religious faith as a kind of "painkiller" effect, which is already the death of Catholic martyrs makes it easier to provide. 
Oxford University scientists have conducted an interesting experiment: It was investigated to what extent the belief in God the pain of the people affected, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph". 
In the course of the investigation were rather bizarre, each with 12 electric shocks believers and atheists, while a painting of the Virgin Mary studied. 
As the results showed the believers were the bulk of the pain off. 
Using a brain scan technology could even be demonstrated that the Catholics part of their brain were activated, for the pain regulatory jurisdiction. 
The investigation was the first in a research project in which scientists also next to philosophers and theologians of various departments of the university participate. 
When the experiment was a sparkling volunteers connected to the left hand tied, which delivered electric shocks. 
The participants were asked to come heavily on two paintings to concentrate: First, an image of the Virgin Mary, painted by the 17th Sassoferrato Century, and secondly, Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with an Ermine." 
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful a kind of religious trance would rise, while da Vinci's image selected because it is scarcely different from the other paintings and was perceived as reassuring. 
The trial ever spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and received during this period a total of 20 shocks in four stages, while they are either the religious or the other should see paintings. 
Catholics reported that they had at the sight of the Mother of God "in safety" felt as if they "cared" would be, and that they had "peace and tranquility" felt. 
During the viewing of religious painting, they have over 12% reported less pain than if they work Leonardo had in mind. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the trial, said that similar effects could also be combined with other strong images even when limiting the atheist cause, you just have to find the photo. 
"We have to find a picture that is very positive feelings triggers, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist. 
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and does so in many cases," said Wright. 
According to these excellent results will remain only question is what effect the Madonna image of Leonardo or any other similar painter on the regulation of pain believers would. 
Would the quality Virgin Mary still better results?
