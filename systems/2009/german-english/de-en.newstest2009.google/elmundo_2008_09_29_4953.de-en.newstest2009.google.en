In sleep talking 
Some children speak at night 
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something of what happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep. 
If you are for the first time happens in the best case you will be shocked, but in reality has no meaning. 
This is a positive sleep disturbance, the talk in his sleep is called. 
It is fairly widespread, especially among children and adolescents. 
Surely, it was more than one of you says that you have spoken at night. 
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (once in life, such as during the high fever) or regular (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child can remember nothing. 
There is no single reason that caused this phenomenon. 
Often relationships with other appearances in his sleep looking like nightmares, night terror, noctura enuresis (bed wetting at night), speaking in his sleep wanted, but there is no reason for it. 
As we have mentioned previously, it may be very high in fiber, stress situations or are overtaxed. 
In any case, this is a little phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it occurs, is highly variable. 
It may be that we quietly speaks in single words, whispers or it can totally be part of a counter (screaming, crying, long discussions ...). 
In the cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child is to observe and at a specialist advice to check whether a problem exists, which causes fear and in this way comes. 
We have said that there is a positive disorder, so it will not be dealt with, whether it is with another sleep disorder, which can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with the stress). 
What you can do is to develop a series of simple prevention measures: 
Try the baby before sleep is not to excite. 
So quiet game for the child to choose stressful and television programs avoid the terrible and something to be wild. 
For nervous children, which recommended relaxing, relaxation techniques can be applied to help them, a certain inner peace to get. 
This helps the child to sleep calmly. 
When talking in his sleep once, trying to preserve the peace. 
Remember that for the child is harmless and the next day there will be nothing to remember what happened. 
Useful advice 
Wake is not on. 
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will be sweep from sleep. 
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests off. 
Remember, if it is after a couple of appearances frightened shows, it is recommended to advise or to find out what the reason for the child afraid. 
If they understand what it says (which is usually not so), sets the child is not under pressure to carry out questioning and more information out. 
To ensure that you will achieve nothing, because if the child is asleep, it is unconscious and not think it can. 
In addition, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming, and why it says, so they were careful with the interpretation of the information and conclusions, it pulls out. 
Perhaps, says it is not the child that night to hear her and know its secrets. 
Not even as a joke. 
That caused much anxiety. 
So, does not worry you, it's nothing bad, this is a moment that only a few minutes.
