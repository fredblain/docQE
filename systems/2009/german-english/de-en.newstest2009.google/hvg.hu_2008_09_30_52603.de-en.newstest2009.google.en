You are what you think about you 
To celebrate their tenth birthday, Google can rightly say: it is in the pockets of people just to see how over their heads in the sky: You know, where people have spent their holidays to which doctors they go and what they moves. 
And so that is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of Google. 
In the direction of skeptics who Orwellschen of horror are plagued visions, he Align: This would be just the essence of Web 2.0 overlooked. 
In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main goal of Google was to have more personal information about users to collect and so the original objective of the company closer to what they're "all information of this world order" wants. 
Schmidt said Google was after ten years of work weltver√§ndernder still only at the beginning of information gathering. 
When asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google would be able to questions like "What shall I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?" to answer, but software programs were not yet able to because they are not enough about the user know. 
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of its Internet search keywords would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which was searched, and the pages visited. 
For example, two years ago introduced "Personalized Search" allows visitors to its own search history to store and later to fall back, so much more precise hits later can be generated, and at the same logic based on the so-called "Recommendations", with which The system customized products and services based on the earlier preferences recommends. 
The users, however, wonder what in the event of a data abuse happened - "If you nachschaut what I do '- show some concern whether the Google data monopoly. 
In most cases, however, it is rather the firm represented, potential power, the frightening effects, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the quest for freedom or rebellion against the power that many Internet users on Rejection triggers. 
However, it is a proven fact that the search not only saved, but in case the occasion also be given to third parties, and in these cases, laws, there is no protection for the personal rights of Internet users. 
A prime example was the recent action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the wake of Google's Brazilian government information presented by the community site called Orkut "were collected and also enabled the identification of pedophilia. 
Rights to personal users worried but still could breathe again in May, when Google jointly with the civil rights organization EFF successfully against the FBI went to court: Google may be in the future with any point of the Constitution be forced to provide information to the FBI for a secret inquiry surrendered. 
(However, the Federal Government has successfully passed the issuance of 50,000 Web addresses and 1,000 search terms, referring to the years prior to Minors Act, adopted obtained, but it was the list of individual users, or whose Web and search list to retroactively deprived of two months.) 
Google's image remains so controversial: Those who dislike her personal data out, because the use of Google services, the loss of their private and intimate sphere of fear, whip the company itself with the conservative performing companies rightful indignation. 
Meanwhile, the American "geek culture", which in many countries and is enthusiastic computer fans, activists and unites users, the next generation of "cool operator" in them, unlike Microsoft, the market leader, thanks to Windows, even if both to the same objective fighting. 
One possible reason is that Google's users, as opposed to Microsoft has not demanded identification codes, and his services free of charge so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package far more attractive, young and seem to be cooler than the official Practices of the software giants. 
Geeks imply the other hand, the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet razor sharp - a relationship, especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" at the center stage. 
When "Web 2.0" is in fact nothing more than to collaboration, say, the user deliberately left traces and use the available channels of communication, and even if the proportions are different individually, remains the same merits, namely to show publicly. 
An average young person may simultaneously on several community portals to manage his profile - from Facebook on Xanga, this means other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm combine, and all this can finally into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or blip. fm mount. Moreover, blogs can lead to the most recent photo galleries automatically, which on Flickr or Picasa are geostet. 
And a good number of other cases shows: When viewing the photos of the party last night soon finds out the girlfriend, with whom her unfaithful boyfriend amuses, or the employee is dismissed because he is in his blog just too honest his anger over the corporate air makes - one thing is sure: The term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted. 
Who is a leading online life, is what it is cheap there - it could be around the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth formulate. 
And who is trying to keep something secret, or even the Google monopoly to circumvent the like can do - such as Scroogle, a tool that on the Google search engine accesses, but intentionally leaves no traces. 
Not a few people deliberately do not register at the Community pages, so that they can not be found, but also the on-line applications from Google such as word-processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, you can bypass with alternative versions, which no huge server parks are bound and therefore also not the best profile of users generate. 
Public opinion, however, banned it waits until Google shows its true face. 
With its current value of $ 156 billion, the company even before IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the Advertising AdWords / AdSense threaten the revenues of Advertising agencies, and the ever faster services are introduced not only Microsoft but also other software developers headaches. 
Critical viewers can find, however, the opposite poles disquieting: for example, has led to a protest group of employees totally rejected the charges after the company's own kindergarten were doubled, also said the management, multiple meals for employees was too costly. This all seems quite mild but on the other hand, indicates that Google in 2006 before the Chinese government even went into the knee and with a consent agreement was that all regimes critical hits, or those who are against good taste violated, would be filtered out. 
The internal rules of the group reads, in advance that no new service is advertised, but only if those already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years back some meaningful upside: While some believe that Google's book and Magazinscan and archiving project will meanwhile proportions that the company soon with the Supreme Court would have to deal with, so are other much more because of the System "health" worried that the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and issues permits. 
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database, delivers the next generation of sci-fi authors already the substance - such as "Scroogled," the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best manner orwellschen a future in which a man thanks to Google nahbar related data is frightening.
