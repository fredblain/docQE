Interview - From the blood that was safe again 
Hema-Quebec yesterday celebrated the 10th Anniversary of its founding, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to look, because Hema-Quebec is one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. 
And above all, it has the public's confidence recovered, by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s had been severely shaken. 
As you know, the blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross national blood-managed reserves during the 1980s with the HIV virus and the hepatitis C virus contaminated. 
Given this tragedy and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Government of Canada in February 1994 a public, the judge Horace KREV led investigation, the aim was to clarify the circumstances to bring to such a tragedy had led, and Directives To a new disaster of this kind of behavior. 
While judges KREV still hesitated, Available his report, presented at a committee several provinces on the legs, whose aim was to create a new system for the management of blood preserved in Canada to develop. 
In Quebec, the committee met Gélineau this contract. 
According to reports from Gélineau and KREV were in Canada two blood banks founded: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, Canadian Blood and the society to the other provinces and territories of the two circuits. 
`1998, when Hema-Quebec has begun its work, had barely 38% of people trust in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary. 
The situation was disheartening. 
Through the tremendous efforts made to the safety of the blood to improve and by working in this area during the following years, we have the public's confidence back ', she says, before she proudly points out that the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of the population of Quebec Confidence in Hema-Quebec had. 
Dr. Décary reserves, however, aware that something `confidence is extremely fragile '. 
Since its inception on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec act in accordance with the principle of prudence. 
At this time we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, told this woman, which since its founding in 1998 the line holds. 
`And we have not had the slightest idea whether this disease through the blood could be transferred. 
So we "made us one of the main guidelines of the reports of KREV and Gélineau, according to the exclusion measures apply if you do not know if a disease progresses slowly, as is evident in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is the case, the by a degeneration of the brain expresses, which inevitably leads to death. 
So we took in April 1999, no blood of persons who since 1980, longer than a month in the United Kingdom had stopped. 
Well, a few years ago was without any doubt, proved that this disease through the blood is transferred. 
To us this incident has shown that the principle of prudence that we applied, certainly has a meaning. 
In 1999 the market a much more accurate techniques for detection of HIV: The nucleic acid test (NST), which allow direct in the blood of the donor, the presence of the virus itself prove, and not the antibodies against the virus, such as The tests used previously was the case. 
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation period, between the date on which the person has been infected and, when the first viruses through our proven techniques in the blood can be held, said the specialist. 
This period was a period of less than a week reduced. 
It was a risk that some donors may be infected without knowing it, and we do not recognize could be reduced significantly. 
These improvements enabled, the risk of AIDS through a blood transfusion to be transferred to a considerable extent, be reduced. 
Today is one of 12 million people risk, with HIV infected blood to preserve. 
`In other words, that 12 million would have to distribute blood before someone would be infected with HIV. 
Since Hema-Quebec each year from 400,000 to 500,000 blood distributed, it would be more than 24 years before a case occurs when the HIV through a blood canned has been transferred. 
I think that we probably feel now, if you get a transfusion or prescribes to restore health ', says head of the Directorate of Hema-Quebec. 
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to improve the safety of our products. 
You never know what pathogens can get into the system. 
Only last year on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus emerged that, just like the West virus by insects on the blood is transferred. 
We must continuously monitor ', continues Dr. Décary continue before they stressed that Hema-Quebec alongside a secure supply also a sufficient supply to make available. 
`The demand is rising because the population is aging. 
Since the treatments to combat cancer are aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets. 
The aging of the population also affects the blood donor network, which on average only 3% of blood donations for residents of Quebec are appropriate. ' 
It can be a healthy man, 18 years or older and suitability criteria are met, every 56 days, so six times a year, donate blood. 
On average, 14% of the people, their blood available, not because they, for example, AIDS or malaria are ill, and who traveled to a country is, where malaria is widespread, is for one year from blood donations excluded. 
`With these 3%, we create it, to obtain an inventory of the needs of the hospitals represents. 
Lack of supplies are very rare. 
But we must be members of this donor network renewed if they are older and no longer donate blood. 
It is difficult for people to convince, to donate blood, but above all to keep and to encourage them to bring regular donors to be. 
The life today is so hectic that one rarely finds the time, an hour when blood donations to spend ', regrets Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of 297 million U.S. dollars Hema-Quebec provides not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, skin and eyeballs, which are almost exclusively for serious violations of fire is used. 
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they Hema-Quebec is temporarily stored, including the only public cord blood bank manages Quebec. 
In the umbilical cord, previously thought to be biomedical waste, is located in rich blood stem cells, which can serve serious diseases such as leukemia, to treat. 
`A few weeks ago we celebrated our thousandth of the storage cord blood sample, and we plan to more than a thousand stations. 
`We should probably early next year to begin, it transplants to make available ', explains Dr. Décary continue the program of cord blood loss describes as very popular. 
`Many mothers are convinced not have access to ', because Hema-Quebec lacks the resources to this complex and costly program in all hospitals to offer Quebec.
