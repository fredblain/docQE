What has been produced in the factory invoice surcharge &amp; Co.? 
On 8 October to begin negotiations in the criminal charge against Janos and his accomplices. 
The accused is in particular the involvement in organized crime, as well as grossly negligent injury and business fraud and other criminal acts - including falsifying documents - accused. 
According to the prosecutor from the bidding process gained funds for his own purposes, while the services often with fake invoices were. 
State funds and grants from the government - a total of HUF 65 million - will be partly into the coffers of the Organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly in private funds flowed to individual. 
As the investigating authorities announced were at the invitation obtain funds fictitious invoices, and the clubs will continue their duties even after his come. 
According to indictment, a large part of the accounts have been falsified. 
The bill blocks were on the market by Józsefváros bought, the circular seal was found in Kiskunhalas purposes. 
The decision as to which company the bills will be issued, it was on that trip around north of Lake decided on by the Lados István János award was sent. 
During this "discovery tour" should Lados guesthouses and restaurants discover. 
He called on the consumptions invoices for later templates based on these calculations for the Youth and Sports Ministry, the Social and Labor Ministry and the government of Budapest to be able to exhibit. 
These accounts should a majority of István Lados and his accomplices, András Ori have been manipulated, the latter according to our information for the constitution of the relevant reports had to be. 
One of the objectives of Lados' "reconnaissance trip" was a local beer. 
As two of the award and Co in 2003 issued invoices show that the catering operation is the neunzigköpfige group of the Association Biztos Pont Egyesület have entertained. 
Now there but the chief of operations at such a large group at once would not in the local hineingepasst. 
Another statement, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért, later known as a együtt Harmadik Évezredért, also had serious form and content errors. 
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj with only three rooms available and no more than ten people can simultaneously accommodate, according to accounts 130 guests have stopped. 
The fantasy of the invoice counterfeiters were also apparently no limits when it comes to Pigal Ltd. fell, a catering operation, in its accounting of customer Jobb Jövőért Hoppa loud and prosecution does not even appear. 
As managing director of Farkas Győző hvg.hu announced it was immediately clear that this was falsified documents acted as him by the prosecutor during an interview documents were submitted. 
"Our company name and tax identification number were on the wrong stamp affixed." 
And further: Apart from procedural defects was also misspelled the fact that the operation of one hundred people have houses, after a total of eleven rooms that are impossible for so many people. 
Was also on the bill have been given food, but the restaurant had been a long time no longer in operation. 
The bill busy and even counterfeiters also have to verify that they targeted exclusively Budapest travel agency offering trips abroad, and so they Hungary trips to the cash accounts indicated what the practice of accounting firm also objected. 
As in the course of the investigation was announced, they have also cited the VAT invoices also cited, although travel benefits, linked to a country outside the EU relate VAT-free. 
The amount of VAT was a total of four from the hotel Révfülöp Kft to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért issued false invoices, since the operation instead of 25 Only 15 per cent VAT charged, also by the employees are exclusively mechanical invoices, the forged documents were handwritten . 
Another error that the "accounting" was undermined, was that in a case of "goods" as the service had, although this is the advice to investment firm specializing do not appear, shared with the prosecutor. 
Another form of errors - false invoice format, false stamps - was too owe that to a együtt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont issued as counterfeit bills could be unmasked. 
Similarly in the case of Bt Ravenna and the sports camps Kunfehértó whose CEO asserts, the bills have never issued. 
Another "mistake" is the counterfeiters in the HIB Kft from Nyíregyháza undermined: This company was at the time (2001) is currently in dissolution, as the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület have eaten there - the trustee was therefore to the bills do not even have to be issued. 
Deliberately falsified 
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they need to fictitious accounts. 
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation has Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the Foundation együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, at a height of about 4 million HUF issued. 
According to the indictment, was managing director of the Collab Ltd., one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to the exhibition persuades the fictitious invoices. 
The moment also wound up BioGate Ltd. will also supplement and Co. have collaborated: In 2003, the Foundation Ltd. Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, as well as the clubs Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with fake invoices for a total of 5 million supplies HUF , which is not provided benefits. 
But there was also little payment because the bills immediately after they were canceled exhibition, which involve stakeholders in their documents but have forgotten it. 
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly linked to the accused to be associated. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman director of the Ukrainian trio of Delta Kft, a Budapest resident, but could not find fuel and vehicle trading company. 
This company is in the period from October to December 2005 several bills relating to the sale of computer components with a total value of approximately HUF 18 million issued. 
According to investigative authority should have been the 14th September 2005 wound up cash from Kiskunhalas Investment Ltd. as a buyer of these acts have bills. 
CEO of this company was a Romanian, the company also documents of Iván Kubatov should be delivered, from 2002 to 2005. 
According to our information Kubatov has confessed during the investigation, invoices on behalf of the GmbH to the clubs and Atlasz Hoppa, as well as a együtt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány issued themselves and their equivalents collects it. 
The company Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Ltd. and the Jos-investment should be of Bt Romanian bricklayers on Iván Kubatovs explicit desire to have been founded. 
In truth, however, none of these companies actively, which, according to Angeklagtem was a lack of orders. 
However, he could from the companies benefit: At the request of his accomplices, the lawyer Zsolt Szentes, with the preparation of the company's founding documents was instructed, he, on behalf of the company's invoices to the charge associated Clubs issued, such as Atlasz and Y -Generáció. 
The overall aim Kubatov 15 bills with a total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the company's cash investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Linaxtrade investment and to the organizations have issued. 
The Prosecutor expects that Kubatov 10% of the total bill and value added tax collects might have. 
Kubatov even should the company Szi Beri-Bt for issuing fictitious bills have abused - in this case were the accounts of the applications Biztos Pont settled. 
The company Y Generáció and Szövetség a Magyarországért Modern in January 2006 have their applications for the nonprofit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ( "TMA") delivered. 
Both received per 500,000 forint, these amounts but used for another purpose. 
To do this hush, they have the TMA five fictitious accounts of the Works team presented Kft. 
Incidentally, these invoices were in search of the offices of Árpád Kemecsei Ministry ensured in the classroom. 
In the negotiations, now by some defendants with a confession about the way the bill forgery, as they have already stored before the public prosecutor were expected. 
Could be a sensation if the Hauptangeklagte János supplement to a comprehensive confession decides. 
His previous indications were that less detailed, and although he had already pledged several times, fully informed of everything to report his confession is still pending. 
So the question remains open whether it is in its interest is whether the Socialists a pact with him regarding the restitution of most of the damage caused by HUF 50 million have been completed, and whether award in return is ready to take responsibility. 
It is quite possible that the surcharge now "insulted" plays, after his requests to mitigate the detention and house arrest on deaf ears were. 
While other criminals, with far greater economic malpractice damage and these have not compensated, at large, or at least are under house arrest, remains surcharge denied this possibility.
