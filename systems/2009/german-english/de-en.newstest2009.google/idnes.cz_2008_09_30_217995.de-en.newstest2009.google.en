Duel at Razor's Edge: MP3 player against mobile phones. 
We advise you on your election 
While nearly every cell phone to play MP3 files, it can not yet a MP3 player phone. 
Therefore, it naturally is that it is better just to buy a phone. 
Despite everything, there are plenty of reasons why a player should be independent. 
The choice depends on the type of use and the demands from the future owner. 
Certainly it is difficult to buy at home for a great expensive turntables, pointed to the latest album by Maxim Turbulence listen to. 
Once such musical innovations appear not to LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason. 
However, you have LPs with type rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream about at least one such. 
So it's with the music to travel, so with compressed music, spoken - music in MP3 format. 
Even here there are price and quality categories. 
For one, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player spend eight thousand crowns, but is also Pink Floyd fan probably hardly headphones for twenty crowns from the market cope. 
Two extremes, between which there enough room for everyone there. 
The selection is broad. 
Even the battery life is crucial. 
Some good music player can be much more than just play music, but what can mobile phones, they do not even implicitly,. 
No modern equipment is only as universal as the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, the phone calls and the cornices, it may be music and videos play, both record, it has a better times, times a worse camera and can perhaps also navigate. 
And if you have the smartphones and communicators inclusive, you have almost a small computer in your pocket. 
There is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can broil and no TV pictures. 
But the universality of mobile phones also bring disadvantages. 
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will however need to reload. 
And the playing of music is one of the biggest energy eaters. 
Few phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours to play, mostly, it is much less. 
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) is significantly more powerful. 
Therefore, you should at the cheap phones reckon that they can not be longer than a few hours of music can play. 
If you then and still on the phone, buy you still prefer security to a charger for the office - even for more expensive equipment. 
For MP3 players, you will not have this problem, including the less good hold at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a time of recharging. 
Another problem exists when the music on the mobile wants to play. 
Unfortunately, only a small portion of the device via a USB conclusion, it is also not every cell phone without special software directly to a PC. 
Of course you can the music directly to a memory play about, but few card readers without reduction with the tiny memory card ready to be used in mobile phones. 
For players, you need to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
You only need the device via USB port with music from your PC to feed. 
Most mobile phones and players put themselves in a music library, arranged by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the assessment by users. 
Some devices are only the tree from the address list, similar to the Windows Explorer, and some can be both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more 
When selecting a specific device, you should especially after the lifespan of the battery, the capacity, quality and type of sound and of course the ease of check. 
Your music is mainly scenery and you hear it every day just for example, in the tram, then extends to any mobile phone that plays MP3 files. 
What really almost any cell phone can be. 
You must also not control what music formats a mobile phone or any player can handle. 
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get is precisely in this format. 
The format is one of the most widespread and, moreover, most devices also music in WMA format play. 
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use). 
Better phones also allow the purchase of music online. 
It takes only about the mobile Internet pages of a provider (or another provider) will suffice, and you can a song or album. 
This service may already in itself a striking argument why we put on a music phone should be. 
Unfortunately, the range of providers and bad only limited mostly to rapid radio hits. 
The prices are not the lowest. 
But generally it is believed that this kind of selling music (be it on GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in the future the music industry will dominate. 
The cell phone, the most for himself. 
If you want to listen to something, you after the phone in your pocket, while the player is forgotten at home. 
It is, however, indicate whether you are at least a headset or a wireless handsfree for them. 
If not, you can use the integrated speakers rely on almost any mobile phone features, but only a few MP3 players. 
Probably the biggest advantage of mobile music is for many in the price. 
The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand crowns. 
For three and four thousand crowns you already have a very decent Walkman. 
The biggest handicap for most of that, no normal headphones are involved. 
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5-mm-opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns. 
The advantage of the player is again in light of the operation. 
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see Selection) - Players can really serve everyone. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity in the operation with the normal sooner or cassette recorders, for example, the turntable is obvious. 
It threatens no collision in the form of an employee mistakenly mobile Internet, and then a horrendous bill for data transfers. 
After what device you should now draw 
Even the cheapest phones (eg Vodafone 527) are usually on a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.). 
Even if you are a card after purchase, ranging from two thousand crowns. 
But consideration. 
For the base models are usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB supported. 
Only the most expensive may also 8-GB card read. 
If you already have a mobile phone and is still an inexpensive MP3 player want to buy, then take you to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, iRiver or Emgeton. 
Depending on the capacity (up to 2 GB), you must then not more than 1100 crowns on the table. 
They belong to the more sophisticated listeners, you prefer to specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the ease it comes to a single MP3 player approached. 
Most is Sony Ericsson, its mobile phones from the Walkman series of the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players. 
The same services at the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) make you MP3 player manufacturers of the above .
