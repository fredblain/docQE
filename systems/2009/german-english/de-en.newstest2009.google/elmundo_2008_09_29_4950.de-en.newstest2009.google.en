For the Olympic Games are the streets in Madrid flawed. 
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympic disciplines in Madrid to organize, after the failure of 2012, but it can perhaps be 2016. 
But I wonder: `Are we prepared for that?" 
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true! 
She was described as the perfect road, and according to my assessment, it was the worst street with all the trimmings, which it existed. 
This is naturally a lot of nonsense, if you consider the assessment would examine it and I could be so clearly not what durchgekommen. 
But, we go from the beginning through everything. 
The nonsense begins with the ticket to get which allows you to be the first to go. 
It seems to me not too bad, but if they approach you already have, then they should give you everything (including chip to the congestion on the roads to avoid). 
So do not. 
Here they let you get just the ticket (the first nonsense, is the only reason to go there) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt, there was only the size of `S '(a second nonsense, because I need the size XL) 
Where we actually live? 
Or is it that after the crisis was decided only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric to buy? 
Well, things like this are a trifle compared to the days on the road. 
Apart from the fact that we must go very early in order to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, furthermore, you need to backpacks leave. 
The wait longer than 35 minutes, which in the case of a street, where 11 000 people expected to be incomprehensible. 
Finally, as was expected, caught the road and we had our back sacks did not leave, even if it had succeeded once, but they would have been difficult to retrieve. 
Also saw it, in those 40 minutes after waiting out the rain, so it came to the temptation of a popular uprising and to organize the house to fall. 
I think tomorrow will certainly be some 500 people have pneumonia, and some like me because of this chip, which I have received, not even time to appear in the classification, I can already feel that the original was stamped incorrectly. 
Obviously, if I am a perfect street would ask me this road would never invade. 
I think we are still far from a dream city, which for the Olympic Games is well prepared
