Now is the written version of the 700-billion-dollar rescue package before the law, in several stages and will be applied to the purchase of bad loans from the banks targeted. 
In the first round is half the money spent. 
In a session on Saturday after midnight east coast time came to an end, the Congress MPs after several discussions to reach an agreement on the 700-billion-dollar rescue package durchgerungen serious, reported Reuters. 
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President in the American House of Representatives, and said that we need to agree only on paper. 
The compromise reached over the rescue package supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said on the outcome: The program is effective and it is efficient, but we need to do more. According to Pelosi were it not for the rescue of Wall Street, but about the helm of the economy rumzureißen. 
The written version of the package was completed before the opening of Asian markets, namely, Sunday evening Washington time clock 8 (Central European Time Monday 2 clock morning), published, but has no soaring on the stock markets triggered. 
On Monday the House of Representatives approves first on the bill to stabilize the economy in 2008, then the Senate's turn. 
President George W. Bush said on Saturday evening with Pelosi and even the White House welcomed the news about the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress of the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties, our markets to stabilize and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House. 
The program, however, differs from the original recommendation of the Bush Administration that the 700 billion U.S. dollars at once for the purchase lazier, with aggressive lending securities should be spent. 
In a first tranche will be up to half of the 700-billion-dollar amount spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the congress as expected on Monday on the Seton will vote. This sum will cover the purchase of aggressive lending, securities that are worse, and the other 100 billion USD should the president decide. 
The program is run by a separate Commission, which is also the president of the Federal Reserve belongs. 
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision from the Congress. 
For the purposes of the Act, the Ministry of Finance may also apply a combination of tactics: It can simultaneously bad loans, mortgages, and burdened with mortgages to buy securities, or other "toxic" loans. 
As responsible persons of the Ministry reported the purchase in an auction, as well as directly made. 
The law allows the affected companies, in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance of the alarming means guaranteed, and the company expected damages to pay fees. 
Henry Paulsen said: The Act defines the necessary resources so that up to 700 billion U.S. dollars as emergency assistance to the U.S. financial system can be made available, whether it be for the large-scale buying bad funds, their insurance, or to avoid a systemic risk, by the collapse of a major financial institution is triggered. 
We shall take the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready for the introduction of the Act, once it was signed, so Paulson. 
The leaders of the troubled and now dependent on government assistance, however, banks may reckon that their severance payments in the overseas slang loosely "golden handshake" called by the government be reduced. 
A reduction in salaries, there will be only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance each aushilft. 
The reduction means in essence that if the Ministry as part of an auction ankauft, said the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the disused bank chief in the pension deported. 
In the case of a direct purchase of bad loans will aggressively turn on the government to ensure that the managers salaries not be exaggerated. 
On the picture is also that the existing Golden Handshake contracts not be changed - the restrictions apply only to new agreements, so the more people participate in the program. 
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries be regulated by law, said the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure. 
The state is gaining participation rights at the participating banks, so the risk to taxpayers decreases, as they also can participate as soon as the economy and hence the bank again rescued better. 
The draft law stipulates that the President of the Congress in the next five years, a proposal must, like the taxpayers their money lost from the financial sector will be back again. 
There were, however, skeptics on both sides, in relation to the plan have expressed their doubts. 
That is not what the American people expect of us, the plan protects the taxpayers' money in no case, said the California Republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures were by the same people pushed, including the collapse of Wall Street are responsible.
