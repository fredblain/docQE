The pride and the strains in the life of the black population in a city very special 
Hidden between the excesses of the theme parks around Orlando, a few miles from the flashy, loud and gigantic driving away, is a quiet town where the pride and the complications of African-American culture come to light. 
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurstons is no longer so easy to describe Hurston as it did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no jail. " 
Nowadays it is a place of pilgrimage. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville came to the famous author of the Harlem Renaissance to remember. 
And still is and remains the city which she describes - and made it a tourist excursion made by them in the Florida Travel Guide started to periods of depression by the Federal Writers Project was produced - in many ways a place of very special variety. 
Eatonville is so independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida are often refused, their true thoughts with the white man to share the "so little about us knows that he does not know what escapes him. " 
Even today, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama, an open conversation about race relations calls, there are many here still tired of outsiders to be observed. 
"We are very anxious how our story is," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the town and municipality member of the oldest church in the city. 
It must be right. " 
Eatonville was a long time as a paradox of triumph and the fight defined. 
It is both a historic example of the black movement as well as a community of nearly 2,400 residents, where the poverty rate twice the national average. 
It is both a stronghold of literature and an example of - and sometimes convicted, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, its roots in American slavery has. 
It is not surprising that residents here both proud and are on the alert. 
And thus began the reservations right to Eatonville's image with Zora actually, as everyone here Hurston call. 
They presented the world their home town in books, which came from the heart and were written in dialect, as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1973) 
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guides changed the city, near the Route 77 is a road through the often-forgotten center of Florida leads to the scenes of black history and human drama. 
Naughty as Oskar, both in real life as well as in literature, led Hurston readers to the store's first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clark, and then turned to private affairs. 
"Off the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-angestrichene white modern school, with their manicured gardens and playgrounds, around which always takes care of Howard Miller, although he barely can read and write." 
They also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and Glenn Lee wrote that "any kind of drinks sold and also what-ever-fit bedrooms to hours." 
In just a few hundred words brought Hurston So Eatonville with self-government, in conjunction, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was certainly not a guide. 
In fact, this was not a portrait, which was appreciated by all. 
"Zora describing things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized by the men cited, the songs about the beauty of their singing, which were full of sexual innuendo. 
She added: "Some people do not want this." 
One remembers here is still to Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida, was withdrawn. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston in the city gebraust came, they usually did without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing trousers in a city which even today is something on their clothing style venerable einbildet. 
According to Mr Franklin was the most fascinating inhabitants, whereas many of them despised. 
"People were always glad to see Zora," said Mr Franklin. 
But "they never stayed too long," he added while he rocks in his chair, on a terrace located to the rear, which overlooks the lake Sabelia in which Hurston in all likelihood was baptized. 
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and their books out of print. 
Together with the bulk of the world Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them. 
Although it was once a famous author was a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived in an anonymous grave buried. 
In Eatonville, there were no big memorial ceremony, no public readings in great style. 
"I do not think they have their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least understood," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston was published in 2003. 
The turning point came in the 80s. 
Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige highway through town, in order to the Kennedy Boulevard to replace the slow pace of the two main community. 
Orlando suburbs had already Highway 4 through the western outskirts pushed. 
The proposal was submitted as Eatonville is still a difficult period in its history recovered. 
Forced integration, among others, had the relatively idyllic isolation of the community to an end. 
In the'50s brought the struggle against racial mixing hatred in the community. 
"In this period was often a bunch of white boys and they threw oranges and stuff on the outside sedentary people," said Mr. Franklin. 
"There was even once assisted a woman was killed. 
They threw a water melon from the car. " 
Hurston questioned in 1955 in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the request of the Supreme Court to force integration by its decision in the Brown case against the school as "insulting my race instead of respecting known. 
Nowadays, residents say that although the abolition of racial segregation in some ways positive, they are the group cohesion in Eatonville and self-consciousness of his young weakened. 
"Black children were accustomed to it, hugging to be - I remember - you hugged his teacher in the morning and you hugged his teacher in the evening," said NY Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group to protect the Eatonville Community . 
That was so long be maintained, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place. 
"We hugged his white teachers not because he was a white teacher - I think there is a cultural divide exists," said Mrs Nathiri. 
However, the civil rights helped to make space for further Zora Neale Hurstons was created - black writers, actors and artists who have sat across prejudices, as it did, with a positive self-esteem and statements such as: "How can anyone Joy I refuse to society! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975 the writer made himself Alice Walker on the way to Hurstons unnamed grave and began to revive her fame to fight. 
Five years later was a much-praised biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway in the bookshelves to find, and she again become a part of the American literary canon. 
The highway project came precisely at a time in which Eatonville famous daughter again in the light of the public stood. 
And this time Hurstons old neighbors saw it as a savior. 
The community began in 1988 with planning a Hurston Festival to show what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many return every January for the celebration back. 
Some years later turned to the district from its road construction plans. 
"The plans of a busy highway fünfspurigen the city accelerated the whole thing with top speed, aroused genuine pride citizens," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier out: "Zora rescued Eatonville." 
The victory against the highway project has led to a change in the self-image of the town. 
It came more and more arrived, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who since 1993 here in the church, and locals started the past to re-estimate. 
Eatonville was established in 1998 in the historic nation-wide register. 
A new single library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 at the neugepflasterten embellished and Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today, Eatonville remains a peculiarity in Florida just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when only 27 black families in the 1880ern was founded. 
(She is now 90% black.) 
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution. 
For most interviews is a necessary permit in advance and some things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, by a painted white and black men in the field work - may not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a penchant for dark, still fear that their community shielded misunderstood. 
And yet, at the same time the larger Hurston Festival, was also an elevated level of hometown pride born. 
Especially young people tend to Eatonville so to see how Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and equally proud, creative and industrious, and mixed silly as any other racial group and peoples in the Americas. 
It is the sincere love for this city to the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew can hear, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, the college plans after Eatonville after returning to the city administration or the police to work, which according to him could use some help. 
And even the younger ones, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned Eatonville correct to describe. 
"Most people who are just passing through here, will think: 'Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after church. 
"But if you actually stop for a moment, and his story, it is a very beautiful city."
