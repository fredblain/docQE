Team record by series in the second quarter aufgestellr 
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after it in the last eight years, more than any other in-Jets jersey auflief. 
Then he saw on Sunday in the second quarter in which the Jets a performance-free game turned into a triumph. 
"It is something I've never seen," said Ellis. 
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, began the second quarter. 
But quarterback Brett Favre pass in Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown arrived, marked the perfect prelude to an afternoon in which their evolving collaboration a giant step forward made. 
Favre found Coles in this district for two more touch downs, a Foreign times as a defender ausrutschte and other times 10 seconds before the end of half time. 
"I am not particularly strained," said Coles on the passes to Coles declined. 
"He is a super player. 
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think. " 
While Favre played catch and Coles, began the defense of quarterback Kurt Warner apart. 
Foreign defenders Darrell Revis caught a throw from injured and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown. 
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught it. 
Linebacker David Bowens then cared for a loss of Warner. 
The last ball loss, forced to Bowens, was probably the craziest. 
The Cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds still left in the game as the Jets won the ball back and Jay feely a 20 yard shot on 34 to 0 transformed leadership. 
That was the most points the Jets ever quarter had reached. 
When he was asked the madness to describe replied Erik MANGINI, the coach of the Jets "The second quarter or the third quarter?" 
Answers to both, because the Jets were in the third quarter to 21 points without a single to reach MANGINI said: "Believe me, I did the second quarter more enjoyable than the third. 
A lot of points were achieved in a short time. "
