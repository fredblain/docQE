Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system was relatively stable, said federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck only in the past week. 
How well that the politicians the word "relatively" used and even einflocht that the German banking sector developments of the crisis will not be spared. 
Because the weekend is now occurred. 
The Dax in Munich quoted real estate financiers, Hypo Real Estate (HRE) is a consortium of German banks billion loan to itself from the turbulence in the markets abzuschirmen. 
A person familiar the situation told Reuters on Monday, the credit support amounted to up to 35 billion euros. 
Hypo Real Estate should only pay interest on the part that they also qualify. 
The money come from both private and public banks. 
Background losses at the subsidiary Depfa. 
The state had financiers, according to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money, refinanced extremely short notice - which because of distrust in the markets now is no longer possible. 
In the first half of 2008 was the cash reserve of the Bank by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros shrunk, the equity ratio had slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent relented. 
The current income and net income from financial transactions were compared with the same period last year dropped to zero, the proceeds from additions to certain assets and securities as well as from the release of provisions for loan losses by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros. 
Only thanks to higher income from refunds of downstream transfer costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the repayment of interest after the tax code and the management of group companies, had revenue of around minus 16 percent can still be modest. 
The formerly state financiers had after its privatization in 1990, initially with commercial real estate loans verspekuliert, then in Aareal Bank had been outsourced. 
Because we in the classical state funding earned too little, the Depfa then reinforced in infrastructure projects and the funding of community projects by private investors and the government committed (Public-Private Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. 
On the value of the subsidiary Hypo Real Estate write-offs now make a "substantial material" effect on the profit and loss account of the group will have hot it is quite vague. 
The fact is that the dividend has been deleted. 
Already in 2007 it was reduced by two-thirds were. 
Hypo Real Estate is Depfa since the takeover a major state and infrastructure financiers. 
It is stronger than other institutions from lending in the interbank market, since it has no customer deposits. 
With the collapse of American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago is among the lending banks again versiegt largely because the banks are hoarding liquidity. 
Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a portion - about 50 billion euros - Depfa of the loan to refinance short-term funds. 
Upon notification of Hypo Real Estate, is the financing needs of the group with the credit for the foreseeable future and the company met "by the influence of the currently largely funktionsunfähigen international money markets" screened. 
From other sources is to hear that, thanks to the refinancing of the funds until the end of 2009 was secured. 
The HRE chairman Georg Funke said, but that the Hypo Real Estate Group the money markets for the foreseeable future will no longer qualify for them. 
Bundesbank and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the marketability of Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured. 
That stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank hoped. 
But given the dynamism and unpredictability of the crisis there is no certainty. 
It is not even inconceivable that the financing is not fully utilized to be. 
But the opposite is not auszuschleißen. 
After late on Sunday evening rumor the bank before the insolvency, can also at least temporary rescue the minds not to calm down. 
The share price breaks by 75 percent to 3.30 euros. 
Pretty good hold, however, the bond rates. 
During the primary debt barely moves show, the prices of subordinated bonds after clearer. 
It affects mainly the bonds of the former subsidiary Hypo Wuerttemberg and understandably have maturities beyond 2009. 
Seem Hypo Real Estate bonds formerly a speculative investment alternative, then their value following the sharp aggravation of the banking crisis and the institute itself, with the acquisition of Depfa until the crisis had brought to the house than the stability of the international financial system to be dependent. 
As long as the banks, governments and less depressed commercial banks to support the system ready yet, as long as may be extended by the timely repayment of pensions to be. 
Or it occurs that, which is currently hardly anyone dares to hope - that the financial crisis in the coming 15 months is overcome. 
But given the deal with the partial nationalization overturning the messages is from the safety of probability bordering currently only has become a legitimate hope. 
The expected long-term creditors, especially some sleepless nights preparing with the decision, whether they are separated from their commitment to. 
Short-term investors can still draw a line to use a loss carried forward for future tax payments to cover exchange gains later years to form.
