</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The uppermost representatives of the American congress and the government of president George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on a financial assistance for the American financial system. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The American legislators reached in conversations about the discharge of a rescue plan in form of a financial assistance for the American financial system in a circumference from 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillions crowns) a breakthrough. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Indeed, this still signifies no victory. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The congressional representatives must negotiate since still some details of the arrangement, before they may publish the final version of the law and vote about that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The plan to the support of the financial system is negotiated on Monday in the American congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On Sunday the chairperson of the committee said this for bank services and finance services Barney Frank of the agency Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the senate could be tuned according to different information probably at the earliest on Wednesday about the plan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to small farmer a communication about the fact that the plan is dismissed should be the first significant psychological factor for a stimulation of the finance markets. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Nevertheless, then it comes to a "disillusionment" on account of the complex mechanisms as one could help the markets also in practice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Paulson: The plan must be effective </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> " We have achieved a significant progress. </seg>
<seg id="14"> We have cleared our different views to how a parcel should look to the stabilization of the market ", said compared with the agency Bloomberg the democrat Nancy Pelosi. </seg>
<seg id="15"> According to your words it could still come on Sunday for a final vote. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Representatives of the legislators met on the night of Sunday the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson to lend his final form to the government fund. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This intends a purchase of mortgage assets unfor sale of the finance societies which overthrow the finance companies in heavy losses and endanger the stability of the whole system. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A signal for Asia shops </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The global financial crisis is also reflected clearly in the stock markets which strongly sink. </seg>
<seg id="22"> To the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, according to the legislators try hard to reach still before Sunday in the congress to a final arrangement. </seg>
<seg id="23"> With it one wants to calm since the investors before shops at the Asian finance markets which lie in the first time zone where a decision of the congress could influence the shops on Monday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Up to now, however, is not quite clear yet, when both chambers of the American congress about the law will vote, also lack of clarity rules over whether the negotiations could not fail at the last minute, nevertheless, still because of a problem. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The legislators hope that it is dismissed during the next days. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> However, the law will still find out some changes. </seg>
<seg id="27"> For the help to the system certain total should be divided into two parts. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The initial 350 billion dollars should be provided as fast as possible as president George Bush demanded. </seg>
<seg id="29"> However, the congress can block the payment of the remaining money if he has the impression that the program does not fulfil his function, namely with other 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Bush evaluates progress in negotiations positively </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Indeed, the president has a veto power by this decision, indeed, the congress can outvote his veto. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nevertheless, in spite of these changes the basic idea of the program has continued which been based on it, finances for the purchase of the bad mortgage securities whose value has liked to attain because hundred thousands of Americans are able no more to pay back her mortgages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> " We have worked out everything. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday about the law, the senate then on Monday ", according to republican senator Judd Gregg. </seg>
<seg id="35"> With the progress American president Bush also appeared contently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> His speaker Tony Fratto explained, Bush is contented with the progress of Saturday and " estimates the on both sides endeavours to stabilize our finance markets and to protect our economy ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Restriction of golden parachutes </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The chairperson of the bank committee of the senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, allowed to announce, the legislators would have agreed on a responsibility for the monetary program, the protection of the taxpayers before losses, the end of Vergï¿½nstigungen and a schedule for the financing of the plan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The new law should also limit the so-called golden parachutes for managers of the societies who are involved in the program and uses a committee upon which the supervision about the fund should be incumbent. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The Ministry of Finance should lead this. </seg>
<seg id="41"> " We have worked very hard on it and have reached a big progress in the direction of an arrangement which is functioned and is important for the market and for all Americans ", according to Paulson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The plan also counts on a help to house owner which problems have with the repayment of her mortgage. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The government should negotiate new rates with mortgages which it buys up and the purpose consists in it to lower the monthly costs for the debtors and to allow it to them, to keep her houses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Marek: Psychological help </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> The suggested plan is after the main small farmer of Patria Finance David Marek a good idea, however, the conversion becomes very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="46"> " Namely, because one does not know by which mechanism and around which price the problematic assets are bought up. </seg>
<seg id="47"> This will be decisively for how the finance sector and the government split the losses together ", said Marek this week to the server iHNed.cz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Whether the plan is dismissed now or in the beginning of the next week, view is not decisive to Mareks. </seg>
<seg id="49"> " It is much more importantly, that to itself the congressional representatives on it to some to support the plan and that they dismiss him as fast as possible. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The psychological meaning of the arrangement about the fact that it comes for a discharge is the most important " at this moment, stressed Marek. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Duel on knife edge: MP3 player against mobile phones. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> We discuss you by your choice </seg>
<seg id="3"> While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still call up. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Hence, it looks of course in such a way that it is better to buy itself one phone only. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In spite of all there are enough reasons for it, why one should get an independent player. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The choice completely depends on the kind of the use and the claims of the future owner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Certainly one with difficulty buys himself for a great expensive record player at home to sound the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc on it. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Once do not appear such musical novelties on LPs, and from qualitative view there is also no objective reason for it. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you have, nevertheless, LPs with kind of rock, jazz or blues in the shelve, probably dream at least of such. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Thus that is also with the music on traveling, thus with compressed music, simplifies expressed - music in the MP3 format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also here there are price ranges and high-class categories. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For one it is not maybe satisfactory to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, also a Pink Floyd fan will take earphone for twenty crowns of the market, however, probably with difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Two extremes between which there is enough space for everybody. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The choice is broadly diversified. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Also the life span of the batteries is vital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some good Music player can play even more than only music, but they not even create that what mobile phones can do by way of a hint. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern device is to be used as universally as the phone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Beside the primary functions, the phoning and the ledge, it can return music and videos, both take up, it has sometimes a better, sometimes a worse camera and can also navigate maybe. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And if one still includes the smart phons and Kommunikatoren, one has almost one small computer in the pocket. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a small miracle, because no fridge can have a barbecue and no television take photos. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, the universality of the mobile phones also brings disadvantages with itself. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The more functions you are of use on your mobile phone, nevertheless, the more often you will have to reload it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And playing of music is one of the biggest energy eaters. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Only few mobile phones can play music longer than ten twelve hours, mostly it is much less. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this regard Music player (especially easiest) are much more efficient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Therefore, you should calculate with the cheap mobile phones on the fact that they can pass the ball no longer as a few hours of music. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you still call up then from time to time, buy yourselves to the security rather one more battery charger for office - this also counts to more expensive devices. </seg>
<seg id="28"> With MP3-Playern you will not have this problem, also the less good ones stand at least 9 hours uninterrupted company all of a sudden loading. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Another problem exists when one wants to cover up the music on the mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately, only a low part of the devices disposes of an USB end, in addition, every mobile phone cannot be connected without special software directly a PC. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Of course one can cover up the music directly on a memory medium, however, only few map readers finishes without reduction with the tiny memory maps which are used on mobile phones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> With Playern you need up to exceptions (iPod) no special software. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They need to feed the device only about USB port on music from your PC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Most mobile phones and player put on themselves a music library, regular after the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for instance, the assessment by users. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some devices illustrate only the tree structure of the address list, like of Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Player are lighter to serve, mobile phones can more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> With the choice of a concrete device you should inquire in particular after the life span of the accumulator, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and of course also to the ease of use. </seg>
<seg id="38"> If music is for you above all a scenery and hear them every day only briefly, for instance, in the streetcar, then reaches any mobile phone which plays MP3 files. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What can do really already almost every mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They must also not control particularly which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process. </seg>
<seg id="41"> MP3 create everything, and most music which you get will be just in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format belongs to the mostly widespread, and, in addition, most devices can also play music in the WMA format. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Less usually is AAC (a format, the Apple and his iPods use). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Better mobile phones likewise allow the purchase of music on-line. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One needs to call only on mobile Internet the suitable sides of a provider (or another supplier), and already one can acquire a song or album. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This service can be already actually an apt argument for it, why one should get a music mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and limits itself mostly only to quick radiohits. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The prices are not also the lowest ones. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In general, however, one assumes from the fact that just of such type of the sales of music (it is about GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in future the music industry will control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> The mobile phone carry most on himself. </seg>
<seg id="51"> If you have desire to sound something, reach for the mobile phone in the jacket pocket, while the player forget at home lies. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Nevertheless, it depends on whether you also carry always earphone or at least one wireless handsfree equipment on yourselves. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker over which almost every mobile phone disposes, but only the least MP3 player. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The probably biggest advantage of the music mobile phones will lie for many in the price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The cheapest ones ordinarily cost less than 3,000 crowns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> For 3000 and 4000 crowns you already get a quite decent Walkman. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The biggest handicap will be for most that no normal earphones are present. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The best and technically most mature phones with a 3.5-mm opening for normal earphones cost up to 15,000 crowns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The advantage the player lies again in the light service. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Really everybody can serve the easiest - and not necessarily cheapest (see choice) - player. </seg>
<seg id="61"> A minimum of functions, the resemblance with the service with the earlier normal cassette recorder or, for instance, the record player is evident. </seg>
<seg id="62"> No collision threatens in form of incorrectly hired mobile Internet and an afterwards shocking calculation for data transfers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> For which device one should reach now </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g., Vodafone 527) dispose as a rule of a slot for interchangeable memory media (type Mï¿½, microSD among other things). </seg>
<seg id="65"> Even if you a corresponding one plays cards postshop, are sufficient 2,000 crowns. </seg>
<seg id="66"> However, esteem. </seg>
<seg id="67"> With the base models only maps with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported as a rule. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the most expensive ones can also read 8-GB-memory maps. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> If you already want to own a mobile phone and buy to yourselves still an inexpensive MP3 player, then you reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Then according to capacity (max. 2 GB) you must lay no more as 1,100 crowns on the table. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Belong to the more demanding listeners, take rather specified mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). </seg>
<seg id="72"> These devices have independent operating buttons for MP3, and the ease of use approaches thus that of a single MP3 player. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Here farthest Sony is Ericsson whose mobile phones from the series Walkman have the same user's interface like the individually sold MP3 player. </seg>
<seg id="74"> The same services in the same price range from up to 4,000 crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long accumulator life span (ordinarily 15 hours, at most up to 35 hours) perform MP3 player of the abovementioned manufacturers to you. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first virtual supplier already comes this year to Czechia. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Maybe </seg>
<seg id="3"> The mobile radio market in Czechia has surely matured, the Czech suppliers offer practically all services how they are also offered by her partners in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Here, nevertheless, something is absent - a virtual supplier who demands classical for lower prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Maybe this will keep waiting no more long. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The fact that the Czech mobile radio suppliers work to most expensive in Europe generally, about that we have often enough reported on Mobil.cz. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This confirmed, by the way, also the telecommunication authority? T ï¿½ which drew the attention to the fact that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the last steps of the European committee in the area of Regulation of the Roaminggebï¿½hren it comes so probably to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile radio suppliers will be cheaper SMS from abroad than at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> How does it come that the prices are so high in Czechia in comparison to Europe? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is easy, there is no competition which really does a fight announcement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Maybe one sounds paradoxical, nevertheless, in Czechia there are three mobile radio nets and a penetration of far more than 100%. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The mobile radio suppliers get angry against it with pleasure about the fact that there is extremely a lot of competition at the Czech market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Pflichtet often also the chairperson of the council of the Czech telecommunication authority (? T ï¿½) Pavel Dvo? ï¿½k, with which had often expressed in the past that there is no place for an other supplier in Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is probably right that a classical supplier with own net has no more particularly many chances (by the way, he would probably find also hardly frequency). </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, there is still a possibility - a virtual supplier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Just the entry of virtual suppliers on the mobile radio market brought a clear prize lowering with itself to which then also the classical mobile radio suppliers had to react. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Besides, there were still before the entry of such companies like Tesco mobile or Virgin mobile on the market in Great Britain similar voices like in Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, it has appeared that there is place for such suppliers and that these can be really successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> By the way, one does not need to look long for examples. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In February of this we have reported about the start of virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In only one half a year this supplier succeeded in winning 100 000 customers more than and in climbing up thus to the 5-greatest supplier of the land. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Besides, behind Mobilking stands the finance group Penta which owns, among the rest, U:fon in Czechia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The advantage of virtual suppliers consists in the fact with the fact that one can concentrate upon a lot of more concrete target group. </seg>
<seg id="24"> To be able to function actually, virtual suppliers need since much less customers than one classical supplier. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They need since no relatively high costs for the construction, the company and the entertainment of a mobile net. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the world the virtual suppliers distinguish themselves thus ordinarily as a Low Cost companies out - they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS what is accompanied, however, often by a less extensive service offer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Thus, for instance, Tesco mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least around half more cheap in than his competitors. </seg>
<seg id="28"> As, nevertheless, the example of Mobilking points in Poland, it can also be a rather good manoeuvre to place on a not stereotyped target group. </seg>
<seg id="29"> This supplier is directed since specifically at men. </seg>
<seg id="30"> " Real guys choose Mobilking - the supplier whom they like and them can trust ", according to David Seibert, the CEO of the mobile entertainment Company, the operator's company of this virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="31"> To say hard whether a similar draft could gain a foothold like in Poland also in Czechia. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The press agent of Vodafone Miroslav also doubts this? epick ï¿½: " The Czech market is for a market segment on which most virtual suppliers are based, relatively small. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, he is relatively fed from the point of the service offer. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In Czechia have no chance, mean the mobile radio suppliers </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> However, it is sure almost that if a virtual mobile radio supplier conquers Czechia this will not be Mobilking. </seg>
<seg id="36"> " Indeed, we talk from an expansion of this successful project, however, in Czechia the negotiations look not particularly hopeful. </seg>
<seg id="37"> It will come rather for a market entry of Mobilking in other lands of our region ", says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studni? kovï¿½, press agent of the finance group Penta. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Indirectly she confirmed in such a way that the present mobile radio suppliers are leaned towards in Czechia to this thought not particularly. </seg>
<seg id="39"> On the contrary, they try to do everything for the fact that no potential competitor originates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Their interest in a start of a virtual mobile radio supplier already shows since longer time the group GTS Novera which would like to undertake an other step to become a real competitor of Telefï¿½nica O2 in the area of Corporate client. </seg>
<seg id="41"> " We have a big interest to offer not only festival net radio, but also mobile radio-telecommunication services to our customers. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And the earlier, the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> We have negotiated about this possibility repeatedly with all Czech mobile radio suppliers. </seg>
<seg id="44"> With some of them we could already reach negotiations progress ", according to the press agent of the group Pavel Kaidl. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Now maybe there come better times. </seg>
<seg id="46"> From not official information it arises that the first virtual supplier is maybe to be expected till the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Up to now, however, this is surrounded by an invincible wall of the silence. </seg>
<seg id="48"> " At this moment we do not assume from the fact that in Czechia place exists for a full virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market shows big Spezifika compared with other markets. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Up to now no subject with a complicated and serious project has appealed to us still in this area ", means in his explanation of Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr? e? from the press department of Telefï¿½nica O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Other suppliers also point to the Spezifik of the Czech market. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The press agent of T-Mobils Martina Kemrovï¿½ adds in rare correspondence with the explanation of O2: " Up to now we have still found no and on both sides advantageous project capable of life on which one could further build. " </seg>
<seg id="53"> And she adds: " In the net of T-Mobils no virtual supplier will appear till the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="54"> At this moment we would already have to be a concrete offer have to be able to think so at short notice. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone directs his attention rather upon the fulfilment of the requirements of own 3G license. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav? epick ï¿½ means about it: " For negotiations with potential virtual suppliers we are open, in particular in the area of Division of costs and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> We look just at this from the point of the customers as the best. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to the construction of a divided net for quick mobile Internet. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The action of the mobile radio suppliers is light to understand, another supplier would call more competition, this would lead for sinking prices and thereby also to a decline of the profits. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Why one should make easier to such a competitor the market entry? </seg>
<seg id="62"> The fact that the suppliers can move in a rope if it is about something, also covers long There and Here around the origin of U:fon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> The probably strongest pressure in the direction of? T ï¿½ went out at the moment when U:fon on the market came, from society T-Mobils. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The publicly accessible information of him also covers this? T ï¿½ web pages. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Now, however, just U:fon is suited as an argument, why one should not admit a virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Martina Kemrovï¿½ noted in addition: " The competition sphere of the mobile radio market was recently strengthened, in addition, still by the market entry of the fourth mobile radio supplier. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Taking into account the character of the mobile radio market in Czech Republic is evident that a new actor would put above all his services high requirements to the market and. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> However, in view of this approach of the mobile radio suppliers the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulation authorities surprises. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Besides, it concerns not only the posture of her? T ï¿½ which does not have the competence in Czech, unfortunately - as opposed to Great Britain and other sophisticated states - to intervene in the economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="70"> This owns exclusively the office for the protection of the economic competition (ï¿½ OHS). </seg>
<seg id="71"> However, this covered his quite typical posture to these whole problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> " Then the market entry of a virtual mobile radio supplier would be possible, after it has come for a completion of the contract between a mobile radio supplier and a virtual supplier about the Anmietung of the necessary infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Up to now no such contract was concluded, because the offer of potential prospective customers was likely for the classical suppliers not interesting enough ", thus in his answer to our inquiry Kristiï¿½n Chalupa of the department of outside relations ï¿½ OHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> From representatives of the suppliers such a formulation would not surprise. </seg>
<seg id="75"> From an authority which the consumer's interests represent and, among the rest, on the fact should pay attention that nobody abuses his position at the market this is more than questionably. </seg>
<seg id="76"> In particular if Kristiï¿½n Chalupa adds: " Abroad where virtual suppliers work quite normally, is to be observed that her market entry has contributed to a prize lowering with mobile phone services. " </seg>
<seg id="77"> Probably, however, do not belong the pressure on correct functioning of the market and a prize lowering to the interests ï¿½ OHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> The almost quite moving harmony of three mobile radio suppliers who arises from her reactions is really shocking in this case. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question whether it concerns really only a chance is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Just as the absolutely same cost of petrol is only a chance and the result of a hard competition with the gas stations certainly. </seg>
<seg id="81"> " The authority has discovered in this thing no sign which point to an action directed against the competition, and therefore she also has no reason to intervene somehow in the affair. </seg>
<seg id="82"> None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, therefore he also does not have the suitable raised responsibility for his action at the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The regulation authority for telecommunications " also lacks the necessary instruments for an opening of the mobile radio market for virtual suppliers probably, Chalupa stated in his explanation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The interpretation of the dominating position at the market is one of many debatable points. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Of course there is an analysis of the relevant markets, worked out by that? T ï¿½, after the telecommunications from the point of the economic competition one single market is. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Then at such a market none of the Czech mobile radio suppliers holds of course a dominating position. </seg>
<seg id="87"> However, some legal experts offer another perception - the approval of the net operator is necessary always for the market entry of a virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And the mobile radio supplier has - logically - for his net the monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="89"> It means that he takes necessarily a dominating position in a certain segment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Even if one does not go along, however, with this argumentation, it should be for ï¿½ OHS at least a warning that three mobile radio suppliers go forward strikingly similarly. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Besides, discomfort of a row of prospective customers (including mentioned society GTS Novera) proves that they bump at negotiations with all suppliers into very similar obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="92"> The shifting of the responsibility on them? Then T ï¿½ is in the telecommunication services a rather usual trick with which dissociates itself ï¿½ OHS from the whole affair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> This was already to be observed in some similar cases. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately, has it not succeeded, in the recently adopted novella of the telecommunication law the extension of the competence? To put through T ï¿½ on the area of the economic competition in the telecommunications, although a row of experts of it had promised to itself an improvement of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The representatives ï¿½ OHS must know this only much too well, however, probably they have other interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It already goes if nobody looks </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> Unnoticed functioning some pseudovirtueller supplier from which there are immediately several in the Czech mobile radio nets remains first of all. </seg>
<seg id="98"> These are companies which spend own price-lists on mobile telecommunication services which are public, nevertheless, only partly. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Ordinarily it concerns since the companies which operate in the area of Multilevel-marketing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The price-lists of these companies ordinarily reach only to chosen. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The joke of the thing consists in the fact that the company appears towards the operator as a classical corporate client which orders a large amount in SIM maps. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Then as an important customer he receives special offers (and other offers). </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem consists in the fact that the terms of business of all Czech mobile radio suppliers forbid a similarly disposed resale. </seg>
<seg id="105"> " Should there be cases which you describe, then it can concern an injury of the contractual conditions with which we will deal then what can lead to an ending of the collaboration with the suitable society ", answered Martina Kemrovï¿½ to our question to this problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> However, it is rather unlikely that such a thing does not get about with the persons responsible of the mobile radio suppliers. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In particular in the case of three mentioned companies it can concern thousands of customers. </seg>
<seg id="108"> Nevertheless, no operator opposes such an action. </seg>
<seg id="109"> From the activity of these companies profits to be neglected do not run towards them since, at the same time they are not impaired - as opposed to the actual virtual suppliers - by the real official marketing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> On possible problems does Miroslav? epick ï¿½ carefully: " The law allows such kinds of speculations, in spite of all the services of these companies are used only by a very low percentage of the customers. </seg>
<seg id="111"> In addition, these must accept that the SIM map does not run in her phone on her name, they cannot dispose adequately of it like the normal customers of the mobile radio suppliers. " </seg>
<seg id="112"> Quite only this, however, must go to her? T ï¿½ seem at least strangely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> In addition, an other question presents itself for ï¿½ OHS. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Do the mobile radio suppliers close the eyes before such an action, why do they balk at a virtual supplier? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It is to be added that ï¿½ OHS to the disclosure of such activities has rather strong competence, and if it does not want, it must not itself with the explanation of the suppliers, they would know nothing about it and her terms of business would forbid this, be content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> When Czechia is the most expensive no more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> As in the text already several times was stressed, the market entry of virtual suppliers brought a clear prize decline with the different services with itself. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Besides, the classical suppliers have tried practically in all lands where virtual suppliers have originated to prevent origin practically more or less. </seg>
<seg id="119"> The arguments used by them were practically identical - a too smaller, or too much saturated market, problems with the quality of the services etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> In the sophisticated lands, however, intervened just at these moments the regulation organs which tried to protect by no means the interests of the mobile radio suppliers, but of her customers. </seg>
<seg id="121"> If it is by formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator originated, and other ones followed this. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately, the Czech regulation organs throw to themselves the whole case like a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Outgoing from our experiences we cannot rid ourselves of the impression that lack of clarity is favorable in the competence in these cases more than. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> However, we do not throw the gun in the grain. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If the background information is right and soon a virtual supplier appears, the Czech mobile radio market will start moving maybe soon again. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If a supplier admits the origin of a virtual mobile radio supplier, will not remain ï¿½ OHS inactive if it is a matter of (to discriminating to reject other prospective customers. </seg>
<seg id="127"> And, finally, then the Czechs will call up no more expensive as the rest of Europe. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Sudeten-German had requested in 1945 of the affiliation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This arises from a letter which stores scientific library in the collections of the Sï¿½dbï¿½hmischen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> If we cannot be a component of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the patronage of the United States on America. </seg>
<seg id="5"> With such a wish some groups of Sudeten-German should have turned in 1945 to the US-president. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Among the rest, this arises from a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and which is kept today in the collections of the Sï¿½dbï¿½hmischen scientific library. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Germans of Krumau ask the American president in the letter, he should permit the return of the "Sudeten region" - on the base of the Munich agreement was taken by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> " We have properly understood the situation and really want to be sure of the words that the American unities enter German territory not as an Unterdrï¿½cker and enemies, but as a liberator ", one says in a letter which lies with the words " people which the destiny of the Sudeten in hug " is signed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Because the connection with Czechoslovakia allows to suppose the Sudeten-German - in knowledge of the Czech national character - that they expected brutality, recklessness, lack of understanding, suppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate over the Bohemian Forest for today and for ever. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> " We cannot believe that you award without taking into consideration the view of a quarter million inhabitants this area a state foreign for us which has suppressed minorities and tries to remove and has contributed purely nothing at all to the victory of the allies ", is to be read in the letter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The reason for it, which is why the authors cannot sign, is supposedly the fear of Rachegelï¿½sten of the " Czech Unterdrï¿½cker ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> If US-president Zweifel looks after in the disposition of the Bohemian Forest-German, it is enough if he initiated a popular vote about in the Bohemian Forest region whether the inhabitants become a part of the USA or wanted to live under the protectorate of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Although the text of the letter may sound a little bit naive in today's knowledge of the post-war history, nevertheless, he draws according to opinion of some contemporary witnesses a good picture concerning the expectations at that time of the Sudeten-German. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Even if the bï¿½hmischen Germans at least had to anticipate that one would negotiate about her deportation from the republic, confessed to himself only few of them such a possibility generally one. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some waited that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Again others believed, they could simply remain in Czechoslovakia. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa who comes from Budweis also confirms them. </seg>
<seg id="18"> He was used in the war as Budweiser German with the navy on the Baltic Sea. </seg>
<seg id="19"> When he came at the end of the war to British captivity and one brought him in a prisoner's of war camp to Holstein, dozens other bï¿½hmische Germans came to him, he should teach them Czech. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> " You believed if they came home, the Czech would come to them to fits ", according to Chalupa. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nobody to the German prisoner of war who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia calculated to his opinion after on the fact, that one him on the basis of the Bene? decrees from the republic would expel. </seg>

<seg id="4"> " If we wanted to keep strictly and formally to the law, the activity of a steward stands in the contradiction to the law about the traffic ", according to the speaker of the traffic ministry Karel Hanzelka. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The accident in which the last week a 22-year-old stewardess died was probably caused by the driver of the LKWs who crossed the way to the bus. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The young woman sat at this moment to all misfortune beside the driver, on on the least sure place in the car, although she had at disposal another two other places. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> However, a bus can also have at the moment an accident or brake sharply in which the steward delivers coffee or newspapers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> A role also plays whether the bus is equipped after the vehicle letter also with standing places. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If this is not planned in the bus, the travelers must sit. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The distant coaches of student Agency have no standing places; what the manager of the company, Radim Jan? ura, compared with Aktuï¿½ln? .cz confirmed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> " We have discussed this with the ministry, and this has not agreed first to the movement of travelers. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Later one has taken back this, and we have reached to a consensus after which the travelers may go during the journey on the toilet if they have her seat ", he informed of his point of view. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The law knows no steward </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> " There is no unequivocal juridical interpretation for the role of a steward - no statutory regulation describes this role. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, there is also no statutory regulation which forbids to the Befï¿½rderer to produce services. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The law about the traffic knows only the concept Vehicle companion; it does not define his rights and duties, nevertheless, ", the speaker of ministry Hanzelka adds unambiguously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The manager of the department of street vehicles of the traffic ministry Josef Pokorn ï¿½, however, thinks that the law covers these problems afterwards. </seg>
<seg id="18"> " It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product licensing. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Then this is everything ", he stresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Buses divide themselves into town buses where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, close traffic buses with standing places and a higher permissible speed and distant coaches without standing places at the highest allowed speed and seats which are equipped with seat belts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As in the airplane, says the expert </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The BESIP expert for road safety Jaroslav Ho? ï¿½n sees in the movement of stewards aboard a bus no basic problem. </seg>
<seg id="23"> " With a liquid driving manner do not threaten many dangers, the situation is comparable with the service aboard an airplane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Also here is not sure, when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can knock herself the head. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> " If a bus brakes, nevertheless, sharply, the laws of physics also count of course. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Just like in the town bus or in a streetcar. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The Befï¿½rderer must clear the security of the stewards by internal regulations ", he says and thinks also that these problems are solved from the point of the law not completely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Jan? ura it is ready to stroke the services </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Student Agency offers services of stewards as the only bus company. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The company occupies about 200 persons in this function. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The manager looks at her occupation also after the accident not as risk-laden. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> " As soon as I gets, however, the impression that the occupation of the steward is risk-laden, I will stroke him. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Coffee and newspapers can receive the travelers while getting. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This would also lower the costs ", he thinks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As an interest in the security the manager of Asiana Alexej Litvin founds the absence of stewards in his buses. However, his society pursues only one fraction of lines in comparison to student Agency. </seg>
<seg id="36"> " We have no stewardesses, we defend ourselves against it right from the start. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Sooner or later this ends with any deadly accident ", he had expressed before not completely one year for T ï¿½ den.cz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> This was an unbelievable tragedy </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> In the accident of a line bus to Naples a young stewardess from the region Pilsen which had worked two years for the society had had an accident. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The Slovenian TRUCK was probably without flashing from the state stripe bent and had obstructed to the bus the journey. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The driver of the bus tried to make way by a sharp manoeuvre, nevertheless, collided with the right front part with the TRUCK. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The fact that two places have been sold for the stewards, does Jan deny? ura. </seg>
<seg id="43"> " These places cannot be reserved with distant connections, they are blocked. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Company wants to sue truck driver. </seg>
<seg id="45"> With a compensation of the family of the young woman the agency will not wait for the court judgment, she expects a financial damage substitute, however, also from sides of the culprit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> A law change? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Not by view </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards aboard a bus could bring a legal regulation on which a 30-headed expert's team of the traffic ministry already works about a year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> " However, this has still reached to no concrete end. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Buses also stand not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones in the journey ", according to expert Ho? ï¿½n. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> " The traffic ministry looks at the activity of the stewards not as something which could substantially endanger the security of the travelers ", according to Hanzelka and the control of the security of the buses lies in the competence of the police and the industrial safety authorities. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Dusseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> There are enough big words in the letter of the WestLB board of directors to the employees of the house. </seg>
<seg id="3"> " The central capital market house of the savings banks-finance group " can originate from bringing together of unities of the Dusseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt ten gramms bank, one says in the writing known on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The WestLB would introduce a "competence block" with lasting profit strength in such business. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And generally such a connection can be the determining impulse to other groupings in the land banks sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Thus it reads if a board of directors wants to demonstrate legal capacity in difficult time. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Since the groggy WestLB stands still under immense pressure. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only to find a future solution on the part of the EU committee, but also by the federal institution for the finance service supervision which has made clear to the nordrhein Westphalian government only a short time ago which urges time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> From an as usual disposed connection between the ten gramms bank, the savings bank customers because of her investment funds know, and, however, the WestLB is already since some time the speech - also on Frankfurt side. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Indeed, ten gramms bank boss Franz Waas let with the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August know, in a coalescence of the house in the Mainz country road with a land bank, possibly the Helaba or the WestLB, sees he no sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, the administrative council the ten gramms which are ever carried half of it by the land banks and the savings bank federations has asked the board of directors to lead conversations about common commercial activities with the WestLB. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Besides, it could walk away around the capital market business or parts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The conversations have, admittedly, one says on the finance place, begun scarcely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the ten gramms bank which counts Frankfurt with her 3000 employees to the more important employers on the finance place is not for the first time the speech if it is about consolidation in the savings bank sector. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2003 it looked a moment long in such a way as if the ten gramms bank with the land bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba can merge. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Nevertheless, from this three alliance nothing became. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The plans had barely become public, the Hessian government expressed itself against a participation of the Helaba in it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Also both other houses did not find then to each other. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The land bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went instead of this to the land bank of Baden-Wurttemberg in Stuttgart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> However, there have been over and over again plays of thought about a connection of the ten gramms bank with land banks. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Last, however, had expressed itself Gï¿½nther Merl, chairman of the board of the Helaba, against plan plays about uniting with his house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> However, no matter the knowledge seems to mature that moving together the different houses of the public law sector does need. </seg>
<seg id="23"> After now the election to Landtag is over in Bavaria, a connection of the BayernLB with the land bank of Baden-Wurttemberg could get closer as the first. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Should the pressure rise to other coalescences, the partners go out to her bit by bit for it. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the south she would be only a junior partner, although they the financial crisis got through up to now by far better has than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="27"> To one uniting with the west LB again the savings bank federation and giro federation of Hessen Thuringia which is involved with 85 percent in the Helaba at the beginning of the year has pushed forward a bolt. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If at most the north LB remained. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> However, such geostrategical considerations are only one side. </seg>
<seg id="30"> On the others it is about the question as the different commercial models of the single houses fit to each other. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In June Merl, the determining question expressed with which commercial model the future ability of the land banks should be guaranteed, has not been answered by the German savings bank federation and giro federation up to now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> At the end a decomposition the west LB which is not wished, however, there naturally could also stand. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Thus is then also in the letter of the board of directors there of it the speech, a "whole solution" is aimed anyway for the house. </seg>
<seg id="34"> How the unities single with uniting with the ten gramms bank allow to bring under a hat, will still appear. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The German bank system is relatively stable, stressed federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrï¿½ck only in pastly week. </seg>
<seg id="3"> How well that the politician used the word "relatively" and also still twined that the German bank sector is not spared by the crisis-like developments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Since now it has entered on the week-end. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo taken down in the Dax Real Estate (HRE) receives from a syndicate of German banks a billion loan to shelter from the turbulence in the markets. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A person close with the situation said Reuters on Monday, the loan support amounted on up to 35 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Hypo Real Estate must pay interest only on the part which it also takes up. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The money comes from private as well as public law banks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A background are losses with the daughter Depfa. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Staatsfinanzierer had itself according to a newspaper report for long term projects for which he has lent money, extremely at short notice refinanziert - what is no more possible because of the mistrust in the markets, in the meantime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the first half-year in 2008 the cash reserve of the bank had shrunk about 95 percent on 2.37 million euros, also the company capital rate had easily given from 1.6 to 1.45 percent. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The running yields and the Nettoertrï¿½ge from finance shops had liked compared with the year before period on zero, had sunk the yields from writings up to demands and certain securities as well as from the resolution of transfers to reserve in the loan business by more than 70 percent on 5 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Only thanks to higher yields from allowances of poststored settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as from the allowance of interest after the tax code and from the commercial provision for group enterprise, the profit deficit with about 16 percent still allowed to be moderate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The formerly Staatsfinanzierer had itself after his privatisation in 1990 at first with commercial real estate loans verspekuliert which had been separated then in the Aareal bank. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Because one earned in the classical state financing not enough, then the Depfa had been involved increasingly in infrastructure projects and the financing of communal projects of private investors and the state (Partner-hip, PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Now on the value of the daughter the Hypo Real Estate must carry out the write-offs which will have an " essential material effect " on the profit and loss calculation of the group hotly rather vaguely. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Fact is that the dividend was stroked. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Already for 2007 it had been shortened by two thirds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The Hypo Real Estate is a significant state and Infrastrukturfinanzierer since the Depfa takeover. </seg>
<seg id="20"> She is stronger than other institutes of the Refinanzierung in the interbank market dependent, because she has no customer inserts. </seg>
<seg id="21"> With the breakdown of American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the grant of credit has dried up under the banks again to a great extent, because the banks hoard her liquidity. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Hypo Real Estate needs yearly for a part - about 50 billion euros - the loan port folio of the Depfa short-term means to the Refinanzierung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> After communication of the Hypo Real Estate, the financing need of the group is covered with the loan for foreseeable time and the enterprise is guarded " by the influence of the international monetary markets widely functional-incapable nowadays ". </seg>
<seg id="24"> From other springs is to be heard that thanks to the money the Refinanzierung would be protected till the end of 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The HRE chairman of the board Georg Funke explained, against it that the Hypo Real Estate Group the monetary markets for foreseeable time will have to take up no more. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Central Bank and the federal institution for finance service supervision (BaFin) assume from the fact that now the market ability of the Hypo Real Estate group would be protected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> This is for stockholders and believers of the bank to hope. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But in view of the dynamism and imponderabilities of the crisis there is probably no certainty. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not even inconceivable that the financing must not be taken up in full circumference. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But also the opposite is not auszuschleiï¿½en. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> After on late Sunday evening after report the bank stood still before the insolvency, the at least temporary rescue is also not able to calm the minds. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The stock course breaks about 75 percent on 3.30 euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Right the loan courses well keep against it. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If the priority debts last to themselves barely moved point, give way the courses of the postrank-loans more clearly. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Above all the loans of the earlier daughter's company Wurttemberg Hypo and understandable-wise the terms going out 2009 are concerned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> To lights Hypo-Real-Estate-Anleihen formerly a speculative investment alternative, their Werthaltigkeit must be looked after the clear increase of the bank crisis and the institute which had got the crisis only in the house, as from the stability of the international financial system with the takeover of the Depfa dependent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> As long as the issuing banks, governments and less groggy commercial banks are still ready for the support of the system, as long as can be gone out from a fristgemï¿½ï¿½en erasure of the pensions. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Or, however, it stamps in this what dares to hope nowadays hardly somebody - that the financial crisis is overcome during the coming 15 months. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> However, in view of the announcements overturning with the partial nationalization only one entitled hope has become from the likelyhood bordering in security nowadays. </seg>
<seg id="40"> This might prepare above all for Langzeitglï¿½ubigern some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate from her engagements. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Short-term investors can use a final line, at least, in addition to form a loss carried forward for the future payment tax payments on course profits of later years. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, should fancy during the first school day in the Tachibana Highschool, the girls catch in to giggle: The German is complete "kawaii"! </seg>
<seg id="3"> What signifies this? </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> " The first school day in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="6"> If I was excited. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Already before the school way I had jitters. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go 40 minutes by the train to the Tachibana Highschool. </seg>
<seg id="9"> I had to find the way alone, luckily I have not got lost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The teaching beginning seems not so strictly agreed in the Tachibana as with us at home in Lower Saxony. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The pupils spin from eight o'clock one, to twenty before nine a short discussion round with the teacher begins, ' home room '. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> However, before the lessons began, I was in the row to fancy myself. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Besides, I am the type which speaks with pleasure before people on top of that before a class of 40 pupils not at all. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because I still had no school uniform, I have drawn an old rock of my guest's mother, in addition blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In this elevator I have positioned myself before the writing desk and have tried to pronounce everything properly: ' Sayonara Wo she Sylvana ... ' - My name is Sylvana, comes from Germany and has in one week of birthday. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the moment I was very glad that I had already started a good two years ago learning the language. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> 31 girls in the class have whispered everything, have giggled and have waved and repeatedly I have heard the word "Kawaii". </seg>
<seg id="18"> I knew this already from my Mangas. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It belongs to the vocabulary important to survival of Japanese girls and signifies ' sweetly, sweetly '. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Then I am darted fast on my place. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The girl beside me has grinned quite broadly, she thought an honour that the exchange pupil should sit beside her. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The rest of the hour was quite quiet, sounded, however, as the gong, I was properly stormed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Everything talked all at once and giggled and asked to me holes in the belly - besides, it is really difficult to understand Japanese English. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Then in the break all her Bentos talked. </seg>
<seg id="25"> My guest's mother had also done such a lunch box to me - this is sometimes something else than the desolate German break breads. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I had rice with herbs, small small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Mostly I have no pale light what exactly I eat here in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The things look strange and taste absolutely new. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Firmly stands that everything is really tasty. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Well, up to the salty inlaid plums maybe, brrrr! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Bentos are at Japanese schools not only simply lunch. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It sometimes happens that a girl gives to a boy a self-prepared Bento which she gets ready then especially skillfully - in hope to get to know the boy with the break snack closer. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Of it I have read in my Manga comics. </seg>
<seg id="34"> I am curious sometimes whether I can also observe this here. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> ' Why then just Japan? ', my friends have asked me when I told to them that I want to go to school for a year in Tokyo. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Then I have always said: </seg>
<seg id="37"> " Because it simply fascinates me. " </seg>
<seg id="38"> In the end, I already read for many years best Mangas. </seg>
<seg id="39"> And so that I understand the comics and the culture in it better, I have also started sometime learning a little Japanese. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> For me was absolutely clear that I had to travel sometime here. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Since I also have a Faible for tradition, customs and customs. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Also rats have feelings </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A rat or a cockroach flees with danger this is called that it also feels fear? </seg>
<seg id="3"> Neuro scientist Joseph LeDoux is persuaded: Also a lot of animals have feelings. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Only how could one check whether do they feel the same if they behave as we? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Internet magazine "Edge" contributions of famous scientists are published since several years. </seg>
<seg id="6"> SPIEGEL ONLINE presents well-chosen answers to the question in a series " What do you hold for true without being able to prove it? " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without I or somebody could prove, otherwise, this up to now where we not even can prove that other people have consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But in this case we may hope at least, because all human brains show the same basic configuration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> As soon as we turn, nevertheless, other species and cut questions of the feeling or quite in general the consciousness, we enter impassable area because the hardware does not agree. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> If a rat gets in danger, it does the same to how many other animals: She pretends to be dead, flees or attacks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> People behave similarly from which some scientists on a comparable subjective experience close. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, I do not believe in it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Two aspects of the cerebral structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience on that of animals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> On the one hand, the switching circuits almost always related with the human consciousness enclose the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of his participation in the short-term memory and to the execution-/control functions). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This wide region is developed with the person much higher than with the remaining primates and seems to be absent with other creatures totally. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At least with those aspects of our consciousness which depend on the prefrontal cortex, under it the knowledge who we are and to plan the ability and to decide reason for the acceptance insists that the person differs even from the other primates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> An other dramatic characteristic might lie in the linguistic nature of the person: Because such a big part of his experience is connected with language, one often says, the consciousness depends on it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this case one could exclude animals. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, even if consciousness would not depend on language, this would influence it indeed, so that procure animal consciousness, how it may also be, would probably make a distinction very much from most of our consciousness states. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Therefore, it is heavy to determine how consciousness may look to other animals. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If it can be measured, as something boarder and subjective, neither, nor, analyzed because of the special hardware, with the help of our own experience, his investigation puts us before big problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Most of my executions refer to the contents of the deliberate experience, however, there is besides still an other aspect of the consciousness which might be academically easy accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without taking into consideration her contents, and exactly this happens with studies about the short-term memory of primates, in particular at the example of the visualization. </seg>
<seg id="24"> However, with this beginning which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed one moves himself rather to the neuralen correlatives of the consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical or also not. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Interestingly this beginning also stresses the meaning of the prefrontal cortex for the realization of the visualization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> What arises now for the sensations? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I lead back them on the fact that an emotional system is activated like that to the fear in one of his own activity deliberate brain. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What we call "fear", is the mental state in which we are, if the activity of the defensive system localized in the brain (or their results, as physical reactions) working memory covers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Thus seen sensations are narrowly bound to the regions of the cortex which distinguish to primates and in particular the people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> To groups with the linguistic nature fine gradations of the feeling arise because we can differentiate states with the help of the words and the grammar and categorize to ascribe them beside ourselves also to others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> On the other hand, for instance, Antonio Damasio thinks that sensations from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the cortex and the brain trunk arise like Jaak Pankseep which concentrates, nevertheless, more upon the brain trunk. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Because this network has not changed in the course of the human evolution very much, it can be absolutely involved in type-covering sensations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Pure theoretically I cannot contradict him, nevertheless, it holds for unprovable. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Pankseep argues what appears with rats and people like fear, probably feels also in both cases thus: How, however, can one check whether do rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly? </seg>
<seg id="35"> A cockroach flees with danger whether also them fear feels? </seg>
<seg id="36"> In my eyes bare behavioral resemblance can still prove no experience equality. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Indeed, the neurale comparison helps: Rats and people not even have similar brain trunks, cockroaches against it a brain. </seg>
<seg id="38"> However, is the brain trunk responsible for sensations? </seg>
<seg id="39"> And even if one could prove for the person: How wanted one to prove it with rats? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> I believe, that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), sensations have. </seg>
<seg id="41"> But I would not know how I should prove this. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And because her sensations presumably differ basically from ours (there the human consciousness on special switching circuits and on language was based), I investigate rather the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> In any case, waves here progress at the neuralen level, provided that one misses the same with rats and people. </seg>
<seg id="44"> How I do not investigate language and consciousness with rats, nevertheless, thus also sensations, I do not know not whether they exist. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One may hold that for shortsighted, but I make headway rather, than to run constantly against a wall. </seg>
<seg id="46"> I am just a practical Emotionalist. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays were cheaper in Europe than in the year before. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In Germany flights became according to a topical study even up to cheaper by 50 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Flights and overnight stays at hotels have become more favorable again - this is the result of a study of the travel service provider and finance service provider's American express train. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The enterprise has analyzed his reservation data from the first half-year in 2008 and after one rising of the prices in the first quarter has ascertained a clear burglary in the second quarter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> After the prices at the hotel market have risen for years, the overnight stays have already gone down in many places. </seg>
<seg id="7"> From January to March the prices rose in 41 of 48 examined European towns still by on an average 6.9 percent in comparison to 2007. </seg>
<seg id="8"> However, from April to June the prices were already lower about 3.6 percent than in the year before. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The trend in Paris and Rome has been clearest where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than one year before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> As a cause for it American express train sees the weak dollar rate which has led to a " decreasing travel urge of American tourists ". </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also finance places are concerned like Frankfurt or London stronger by the decline of the hotel prices than industrial locations like Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In the Norwegian town the hotel prices with an increase of 26.3 percent hold even the record in Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Also with the flight prices the trend pointed in the first quarter still upwards: </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because of the kerosene rise in price travelers had to pay 7.1 percent more than 2007 in the Economy class on an average, fuel-intensive long-distance flights became even up to more expensive at 29.2 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> From April to June the prices of flight tickets of the Economy class sank by on an average 12.5 percent in comparison to the preceding quarter, nevertheless, in the business and First-Class the prize changes were by far lower. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In Germany the prices broke even stronger one than in other European lands: </seg>
<seg id="17"> From January to March the prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they sank by 23.6 percent. </seg>
<seg id="18"> On German domestic flights the prices have even halved themselves according to the study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Reason for the steep fall in prices is on the one hand the declining economic growth, explains the enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The inquiry in many segments of the flight market crumbles. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the other hand, there is by the Open ski agreement which liberalizes the air traffic between the USA and Europe a raised competitive pressure. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Sign of the tense position is the cancelation of unprofitable distances with Airlines, as well as the high number of the airlines which would have announced in 2008 bankruptcy in the first half-year - only in Europe were of these 24 airlines. </seg>

<seg id="2"> For many years a mysterious phenomenon provides with brisk for desperation: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing by manoeuvres. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einsteins could not be quite right. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Nearly 18 years the space probe "Ulysses" flew by the space. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Now because of soon freezing fuel pipelines the cold's death threatens her. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> Among scientists a mysterious phenomenon provides for many years for confusion - the swing by anomaly. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Swing-by is received a flight manoeuvre from space probes, with the swing additional them in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, possibly of the earth. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The probes can thereby save a lot of fuel. </seg>

<seg id="10"> What surprises the researchers, besides, however, already for many years: The missiles do not behave 100-percent in such a way as one would expect it after the venerable law of gravitation. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Rather it comes to irregularities in the speed. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The probes become unexpectedly quick or slower. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Up to now the physicists could not explain this effect. </seg>

<seg id="15"> Some experts fear that possibly even the general theory of relativity Albert Einsteins which describes the attraction of matter by a bend of the space could not be quite right. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The American physicist Stephen Adler of the institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still believes firmly in the fact that Einstein did not wander, and tries to explain the swing by anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter, the astronomers in the universe have put out. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had tied up them and had connected her eyes before he sexual actions carried out, while her mother was away around by a restaurant to work. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Trerise and his woman separated in the 1980th and he moved back to Cornwall. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: " You are an extremely strange Fetischist and for her victim it must have been horrific, in particular because she was only seven. </seg>
<seg id="18"> This joyless history ends with the suicide of the victim. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Still the fact is more badly that it is very unlikely that the affair would be ended in court if she had not done this. " </seg>
<seg id="20"> He added: " I take which consequences to the knowledge, according to description of Stephanies father and mother, her action about the years on her daughter had. </seg>
<seg id="21"> She would have been otherwise unambiguously a promising, successful and happy young woman. " </seg>

<seg id="2"> In this issue of "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates to the bilingual education. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific employee in Kalifonischen studies and leading manager in the department of Educational sciences in the Pacific Research institute for Public Policy, is not a co-author of the book " virtually one thinks: Why the middle class needs a school choice ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To appeal to the B sharp-panic voters is a complex task. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Barrack Obamas suggestions on the subject Education are a typical example of it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Obamas electoral campaign mentions to conclude successfully the likelyhood with afro American and B sharp-panic pupils the school ", is lower, than with white pupils " - what is right. </seg>
<seg id="7"> To close this achievement distance, Obamas educational plan especially under the others recommends a bilingual transitional phase in the education for those which only learn English. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The question to Obama still consists in the fact whether his application contradicts for the bilingual education which lays the main focus on lessons into other languages than English his interest to reduce the distance in the school achievements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> If we take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The majority of the pupils are B sharp-panic and come from families with low income. </seg>
<seg id="11"> More than a third of the pupils from which many are only recently in the land learn English. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Astonishing 100 percent of pupils of the fourth class have still passed in 2008 the state check in math at a good level. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Likewise unexpectedly 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were valued in the English check as good. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This astonishing success was reached with other methods, than those which are preferred by Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> School Sixth Street lays her main focus on examination and practise, on steady control of the knowledge and a posture which tolerates no exceptions. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Besides the school carries out the beginning after which the education runs in English-speaking surroundings. Exactly this is the point which Obama should follow, according to the head mistress Linda Mikels. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This beginning lays value on the almost exclusive use of the English language in the professional lessons. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mrs. Mikels who rejects the idea of bilingual education said to me, the school would have a noteworthy success with a pupil who had come only briefly before it from Mexico. 12 months later one would enter the classroom and can recognize him no more. </seg>
<seg id="19"> " It functions ", she marked, " it functions for us ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Dignity Obama a school like "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with big interest in Latin-American and other English from learning pupils take? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The achievements of the school would make easy the answer to this question, however, the educational positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time the idea of bilingual education) and his own logical support of the bilingual education do predictions about Obamas answer uncertainly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> While he agrees to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently has the subject trivialisiert, while he marked that people should stop, itself worries about on " only English " aiming legislation do. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Instead, he said: " You should make sure that your child can do Spanish ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If Obama wants to close the achievement distance really, he should take into consideration carefully educational models which function instead of despising them and to trivialisieren. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has pointed again, why him some hold for the best long-distance runner of all times, after he has broken his own record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and has become the first person who has created the distance of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The last month Gebrselassie has let out the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because of fear which was maybe exaggerated in the Nachhinein that the air pollution could aggravate his asthma problems. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Instead, he has announced himself for the competition in Berlin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In almost ideal conditions - with the sun and 9 degrees in the start and 13 degrees in the purpose - Gebrselassie at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile has won. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Since road runners have changed like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya on long distances, the record time is for marathon during the last 10 years has liked around more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo has won there Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> After his victory on Sunday Gebrselassie of the press has informed, he would have had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and, therefore, could not train one week. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Obviously he is refreshed after break and not rusty come back. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> He was criticized for it - in particular in Kenya, rivals of Ethiopia from East Africa - that he orchestrates his racing runs excessively many world-best marathon stars avoids in general, counts too much on the racing leaders, as if that was a road running, and it puts world records about the competition. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, this criticism barely damages to the size Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, in a town of the quite special kind </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hidden between the outgrowths of the leisure parks in the vicinity of Orlando, few miles away from the glittering, loud and huge activity, there lies a quiet town in which the pride and the complications of the Afro American culture appear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Eatonville, the first totally black town in the land and the hometown Zora Neale Hurstons, is as easy no more to describe as Hurston it in 1935 did: " the town with 5 lakes, three Krocketplï¿½tzen, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison. " </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nowadays it is a pilgrim's site. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Alice Walker, tones Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! To think festival in Eatonville come around the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And still is and does remain the town which she describes? and she did a tourist destination, while it took up them in Florida guide who was produced at the times of the depression by the federal author project? in many respects a place of the quite special kind. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Eatonville is so independent, good-quality and private like in the 1930th when Hurston wrote that rural black municipalities in Florida often refused to divide her true thoughts with the white man who knows " so little about us that he does not know what to him escapes. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Even nowadays, in one year in him a black Prï¿½sidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, for an open conversation about race relations appeals, these are many here furthermore suffer from being observed by outsiders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> " We are anxious very much of it like our history is told ", according to Hortense Jones, 59, from birth an inhabitant of the town and parishioner of the oldest church of the town. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It must be right. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Eatonville was defined for a long time as a paradox of the triumph and the fight. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a municipality of nearly 2,400 inhabitants in whom the poverty rate is high twice as like the land average. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is on the one hand a stronghold of the literature and, on the other hand, an example him - sometimes convicted, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south which has her roots in the American slavery. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is not astonishing that inhabitants are here proudly as well as on the hat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And so properly the doubts began around Eatonville's image, actually, with Zora as here all Hurston call. </seg>
<seg id="16"> She introduced to the world her hometown in books which came sincerely and were written in dialect, as well as " Mules and Men " (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Five sales in the Florida guide changed the town which lies quite near of the route 77, a street through the often-forgotten center of Florida leads, to the scenes of black history and human drama. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Cheeky like Oskar in the real life as well as in the literature, Hurston reader led to the store of Eatonvilles to the first mayor, then Joe Clarke, and turned to more private affairs. </seg>
<seg id="19"> " Off the street to the lefts ", she wrote, " is the brown white lacquered modern school, with her cultivated gardens and playgrounds after which always Howard Miller looks, although he can barely read and write. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> She also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn " drinks of every kind sold and was auch immer to hourly rooms fits. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In only few hundred words Hurston associated Eatonville with selfgovernment, but also with illiteracy, the second marriage and sex. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This was definitely no guide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, this was not a portrait which was estimated by all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> " Zora described the things in such a way as they were ", according to the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls the Hurston perpetuated, while she quoted the men who sang songs about them her beauty which were more fully of sexual allusions. </seg>
<seg id="25"> She added: " Some people did not like this. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> One remembers here still Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly, after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that if Hurston came to the town showered, she did this mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and with trousers dresses, in a town even today itself something imagines on her venerable clothes style. </seg>
<seg id="28"> According to Mr. Franklin most inhabitants were fascinated, while many they despised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> " The people were to be seen always gladly Zora ", said Mr Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But " she never remained too long ", he added there during him in his chair swung, on a terrace situated to the back which looks at the Sabelia lake in which Hurston was christened most probably. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As a Hurston in 1960 died it was poor and her books were made a mistake. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Together with the large part of the world Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although she was once a famous author, a Zeitgenï¿½ssin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman in the Barnard college in the 1920th, became they in fort Pierce, Florida where she lived, buried in an anonymous grave. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In Eatonville there was no big commemorative celebration, no public readings in the big style. </seg>
<seg id="35"> " I do not think that they have understood her contribution in the world or her inheritance in the least ", according to Valerie Boyd, author of " Wrapped in Rainbows ", a biography about Hurston it was published in 2003. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The turn came in the 80s. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Orange county authorities wanted to lay a fï¿½nfspurige highway through the town to substitute for the Kennedy boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the municipality. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Orlandos suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 by the western outskirts. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The suggestion was presented when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Compulsive integration, among the rest, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the municipality. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In the 50s the fight against mixing of different races brought hatred in the community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> " In this time often came a heap of white boys and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting apart ", said Mr. Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="43"> " There was even once a woman besides was killed. </seg>
<seg id="44"> They threw a water melon from the car. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> In 1955 Hurston questioned in a writing to the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the uppermost court of law to force integration, while she called his decision in the case Brown against the school council as " insulting instead of my race respecting ". </seg>
<seg id="46"> Nowadays inhabitants say that although the abolition of the racial segregation was positive in some regard, she weakened them the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of his youngsters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> " Black children were accustomed it to be embraced - I remember this - one embraced his teacher in the morning and one embraced his teacher in the evening ", according to N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing manager of the charitable group for the protection of the Eatonville community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> This could be maintained so long, she added, to teachers and pupils came no more from the same place. </seg>
<seg id="49"> " One did not embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there a cultural gap exists ", said Mrs. Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> However, the civil rights have contributed to the fact that place was created for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who ignored prejudices, as well as she did it, with positive self-confidence and statements such as " How somebody can refuse to go along the joy of my society! </seg>
<seg id="51"> I do not understand it. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In 1975 the author Alice Walker on the way did anonymous grave to herself Hurstons and started to fight for the revival of her fame. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Five years later a much promised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was to be found in the book shelves, and did them once more a part of the American literature canon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> The major road project came exactly at a time, in the Eatonvilles the most famous daughter once again in the light of the general public stood. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And Hurstons old neighbors them saw this time as a rescuer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> The municipality began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festivals to point what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> Some years later the district of his road construction plans turned away. </seg>
<seg id="59"> " The plans of a fï¿½nfspurigen major road animated the town, accelerated the whole at top speed, woke up real civil pride ", said Mrs. Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Mrs. Boyd a little more simply expressed it: " Zora saved Eatonville. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> The victory against the major road project has contributed to a change of the self-image of the town. </seg>
<seg id="62"> There came more and more incomer, as well as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who goes since 1993 here to the church, and locals started to estimate the past anew. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Eatonville was taken up in 1998 in the national historical register. </seg>
<seg id="64"> A new one-story library (of course to Hurston named) opened in 2006 on the new-paved and improved in appearance Kennedy boulevard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> Nowadays Eatonville is still a specific feature in Florida: only 6 miles of the city center Orlandos she can sometimes feel like a lane Hinter in the summer rain, as small as at that time as them was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880th. </seg>
<seg id="66"> (Nowadays she is black to 90%.) </seg>
<seg id="67"> Outsiders in search of the history Eatonvilles and his meaning are often still treated with care. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> An approval is necessary for most interviews in the approach and certain things - as well as the wall painting of Eatonvilles of the oldest church which was painted by a white and shows black men at the field work - may not be photographed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a predilection for Dark red, still fear that her guarded community is misunderstood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> And still, at the same time to the Hurston festival bigger became, a raised degree was also born in home pride. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Above all young people incline as to see Eatonville as Hurston her whole race saw: wonderfully, mixes with all his problems, neither worse even better and as proudly, creatively and diligently, stupidly and like any other race group and people's group in America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> It is the frank love to this town one in the voice of Mr. Franklin nephews can hear, to 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, that plans after the college to return to Eatonville to work in the city administration or at the police which could use some help according to him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73"> And even the younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from winter park, have learned to describe Eatonville properly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> " Most people who drive through only here will think: " Oh this town is nothing in comparison to all the others ", said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after the church. </seg>
<seg id="75"> " But if one really stops and looks a moment long at his history, it is a very nice town. " </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> No sales, no frill, no costumes for the appearance. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The nature of the big flamenco dancers who renounce the concentration and devote themselves to the interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the one hand artist </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, personality </seg>
<seg id="6"> I look in private life, at these moments which are foreign for the audience, I know, when I can find typical gesture, the depth of a stolen look or Ausdrï¿½ckstï¿½rke of the hands which are procured because they are not entered the stage for the personality. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his project 'Flamenco-people' German photographer Gï¿½nter Bauer shows rich in change histrionics of some stagings on the stage with singer, dancer and guitarists. He was known by this side for the artists still a little. </seg>
<seg id="8"> With this suggestion the photographer creates a special Ikonografie of the flamenco representation at different levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The exhibit which belongs to the program of the month of the photograph of the flamenco ` reflects the international importance of flamenco which becomes bigger and bigger from the day day, ', explains the artist and makes clear that 'Flamenco-people' ` can be every any person, but if one looks the photos, the viewer notices that these are no typical pictures of artist on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Quite normal people on the portraits are artists, they are able on the stage passion to provide sadness, joy and to move with it the audience. </seg>
<seg id="11"> To be able to hold on the personality of these artists, one must do no photos on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Their personality and her character is in her hearts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> What was interested me to create a personal atmosphere which would enable to me to hold on the characters of the biggest flamenco masters with the photo camera '. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Farmer, inspired by the festival ` Cante de read Minas', came along in 1997 on a long trip to take a photo of singer, of Gitaristen or dancer with a digital camera. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Thanks to the Bildsortierungsfunktion of the camera and the available material, originated the pictures which remind of classical photograph. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The application of different stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the picture by which to the picture the modernity and the idea, as the farmer understands flamenco, are lent: ` The music with traditional roots which changes and surprises every day '. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This is not only the dance, the song or the instrumental play in themselves, but the personality of the artist, his character which entices the audience with his art. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The search for the essentials, after certain something which becomes visible in form of the hearing, the being is and was the steady purpose of this work which is presented in the next time in the gallery of the El Fotï¿½mata. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Known personalities in flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and other belong for the narrow choice of nearly seventy artists who were photographed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The project became an anthology of the flamenco and will soon appear book, with all portraits from the exhibit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Farmer's passion to the portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago once more and to realize as ` portraits of the veterans of the Sports' (` of SportARTproject'). </seg>
<seg id="22"> Although the drafts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives ` to it like me very much to take a photo of the people, to get to know them and to move me into their life state, it is for a short moment or a longer time. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I think that in the area of the photograph the portrait is the most difficult type. </seg>
<seg id="24"> You meet or bump into persons, personalities whom you sometimes do not know at all, or they leave you for a pair of minutes alone to be able to do a photo. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I try to realize always my ideas. ' </seg>
<seg id="26"> The collection of the portraits of the flamenco from today with the title 'Flamenco-people' is issued in the gallery of the El Fotï¿½mata which is in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and runs in parallel with street la Alameda de Hï¿½rcules. You can visit the exhibit up to the 16th October. </seg>

<seg id="1"> ` Sangre de mayo ': Heroic book of Garci </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Inspires from ` Episodios Nacionales' of Benito Pï¿½rez Galdï¿½s, Josï¿½ Luis Carci shows the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in ` Sangre de mayo '. This is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with approximately 15 million euros of investment for the shooting. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In this manner the cineaste has tried to explain ` today an amount from personalities and social analysis ' what he has admired always in the works of the famous novelist explained Carci by the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiï¿½rrez and Paula Echevarrï¿½a at the beginning of a long list of the actors. </seg>
<seg id="4"> ` Sangre de mayo ' with a film length of more than 2,5 hours, is presented this Friday in cinemas and is shown later on transmitter Telemadrid than one 4-hour miniseries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Josï¿½ Luis Garci, big fan of the literature of Galdï¿½s, assures that thanks to this rotary work his 'childhood dream' went to fulfilment. He has to owe this to Esperanza Aguirre which asked him three years ago of the autonomous community Madrid to turn a commemorative film to the second century celebration on the 2nd November in Madrid. Above all because the history is based on the basis of ` Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The whole contribution of 15 millions which was put by the autonomous community Madrid for shooting offers Garci as he added, the ` unique possibility ' with the help of decorations and suitable clothings the picture of ` confused Spain which selected the wrong leader for the fight because the people by the fight for the independence and under the rule of the Ferdinands of VII in remains brought had become to explain '. </seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the cineaste regrets that one could not count on the financing like with 'Alatriste' or ` lot fantasmas de of Goya' (two times high as with ` Sangre de mayo '), so, some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valcï¿½rcel with whom Garci almost his whole career cooperated could not. </seg>
<seg id="8"> That's why, Garci who was also a film manager in ` Volver a empezar ' has helped by his usual approach: he positioned himself on the stage to the actors with whom one must rehearse first before one starts to turn and for those which had done no casting, he seemed 'mortifying' and respect getting, ` a part of the occupation of the film manager consists in performing help in the theater and in the cinema to know what happens in the film industry in which one works. ' </seg>
<seg id="9"> Many actors into whom he bumps in ` Sangre de mayo ' must repeat before his camera, like in the case of Miguel Rellï¿½n, Carlos Larraï¿½aga or Fernando Guillï¿½n Cuervo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (from which he has won one) is of the opinion and assured that none of three candidates who represent Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year shows a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Neither ` Sangre de mayo ', nor ` Siete mesas de billar francï¿½s' and, in the end, also not the well-chosen film ` lot girasoles ciegos'. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For this film Garci expects no honorings. </seg>
<seg id="12"> ` At the beginning you believe that you work for the progeny, later you notice that it is only for prospering, and now you are contented if one has produced one more film ', explains Garci after more than 30 years of occupation. </seg>

<seg id="14"> He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered like different losses also profits: was founded by the endowment which has made a mistake to the fight against the drugs and to honor of his son from the first marriage who died of overdose up to own brand of home-baked and organic products. </seg>
<seg id="15"> All that is a present for the land in which it cost him a lot of trouble to assert itself against a deadly food culture. </seg>
<seg id="16"> A wide wave of the surprise hits very high over Hollywood without taking into consideration nationality and nationality to take. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a person has died, but the whole era. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Englishman Sam Mendes, film manager and Oscar prizewinner, said that the work with Newman was no less than the point of his career no more or. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia dared to call Newman his biggest inspiration. </seg>
<seg id="20"> ` The biggest of us to all has left us ', confirmed George Clooney, maybe one of few which dare today try to live like Paul Newman lived: high requirements for the righteousness receive, a responsible private life, far from the cameras lead remotely. </seg>
<seg id="21"> This is not always easy or not even possibly in the today's media jungle. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But there is somebody who tries it, and Paul Newman was an example of it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He separated once and was married afterwards fifty years with Joanne Woodward to whom he was loyal, although there absolutely many possibilities was not to be. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For what should I eat an inhabitant of Hamburg on the street if I have at home fillet? ', he often joked himself. </seg>

<seg id="1"> For the Olympic games the streets fall short in Madrid. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes which is a dream many of us to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, nevertheless, after the failure for 2012, it can be maybe in 2016. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But I ask myself: ` Are we prepared for it? ' </seg>
<seg id="4"> Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not right! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It was called perfect street, and according to my judgement, it was the worst street with all around and in it which there was. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Of course this is an amount of nonsense if one followed the assessment and I could check it, would not have come through something so unambiguously. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But, we go through from the outset everything. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The nonsense starts the Ticketholen which allows to you to go as more first. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It also does not seem to me to be bad, but if they allow to already go forward you, they should also give to you everything (including chip to avoid the traffic jam on the street). </seg>
<seg id="10"> Thus, nevertheless, not. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Here they let you only get the ticket (the first nonsense which consists in passing only, so,) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! There was the T-shirt only in the size ` hall' (the second nonsense because I need the size XL) </seg>
<seg id="12"> Where do we live then, actually? </seg>
<seg id="13"> Or is it in such a way that was decided after the crisis only small to buy much cheaper shirts from less material? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Thus well, things like this are a little thing in comparison to the days on the street. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Apart from the fact that one must go very early to get the chip, is there already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, one must leave the backpack. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The waiting has lasted more than 35 minutes what is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the end how it was also to be expected, the street started and we did not have our back bags before it leave, even if one had succeeded once, but to fetch back them would be quite difficult. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, it looked, in these 40-minute waiting period after rain, so that it came to the temptation to organize a national uprising and to attack the small house. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I believe, mornings will have absolutely some 500 people pneumonia and some like I will appear because of this chip which I have got not even on time with the classification, I can already imagine that the exit was wrong stamped. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Naturally if one asked me for a perfect street, this street would never occur to me. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thus I believe, we will still dream long of a town which is well prepared for the Olympic games </seg>

<seg id="1"> Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On ` Emerging Technology Conference ', organizes from WITH, has introduced to Microsoft the progress of the new picture recognition system and the human interaction, a being of the artificial intelligence without a lot of intelligence which is able, nevertheless to do some primitive tasks as for example a taxi order (or in the case of Microsoft that is a route planner to move on the campus of the enterprise). The system follows what hears it during the entertainment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this 'Rezeptionistin' can recognize how many persons are in the space who they are and remember even how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of her entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It can also arrange the persons present according to the conversations in the groups. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the presentation video ` the Rezeptionistin' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not accompanying to the group which leads with her conversation, and that also no company employee is. </seg>
<seg id="6"> She asks whether the person wants to visit here somebody and answers that she soon listens. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Everything without blue Screenshot </seg>
<seg id="8"> Impressively </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> This is absolutely the future. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Now the enterprise has the better things upon which it can concentrate, for example, on the next version of her operating system Windows. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This week one spoke very superficially about the strategy change of Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Windows 7 will be quicker and not have many integrated programs so. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Steve Ballmer found out that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would function 5 times faster. Person, Steven, this will be only for to few. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Everything is only one statement if one thinks that Microsoft in Windows added to versions an one or other function and ` Extras'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The change of course is worthwhile </seg>
<seg id="16"> Microsoft is right, the operating system loses bit by bit to meaning, exactly like the software. </seg>
<seg id="17"> When Google chrome appeared in the net, was a part of the theory that it is the first step of Google to compete with Windows. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Cleverly many pointed out to the fact that the browser is no operating system. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The operating system, as an inalienable part, will be always necessary, so that hardware and software can function at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The operating system fulfils the function which can be compared to the function of his wife or his husband if it is a matter of informing of something his mother-in-law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> That's right. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The system will never disappear, but one must think of his 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth. </seg>
<seg id="23"> What said Ballmer this week, is the confirmation of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The people give every time less attention to the operating system, for it more to the web browser. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The computer is only begun to explain the Firefox, the Explorer or chrome and we spend every day more time in surfing, than in the surroundings of the 'windows'. </seg>
<seg id="26"> For which does half serve in the computer of available applications? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Less is more </seg>
<seg id="28"> And Windows 7 must go more compactly, much is more compact than Vista. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Lighter, did not exaggerate in such a way, less complex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The interest of Microsoft consists more in integrating his on-line services which can become then, in the end, the alternative to Google. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the reality they need this, without doubt. I bring a small example of it. </seg>
<seg id="32"> I have the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreational rooms for Microsoft employee at the beginning of the month done. </seg>
<seg id="33"> On the soft drink machine a sign is fastened: ` Your search. Our future '. It prints out a request to use own tools for on-line search. </seg>
<seg id="34"> In 2006 an independent study came in the end that used 66% of the employees in Microsoft, Google for the searches in the net. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> By the way, the last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows mobile 7 has got in the delay. </seg>
<seg id="36"> She will appear not beginning, but in the end of 2009, rather even in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Microsoft searches the possibility to bring mobile 7 at the same time on the mark to Windows 7 and Windows. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Every day the phone changes into a computer. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The Android and iPhon are already at the market, but the other delay will cost money. </seg>

<seg id="1"> In the sleep talk </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> At night some children speak </seg>
<seg id="3"> I mine not those which wake and tell to us, besides, something what has happened during the day before it, but the children, which speak during the sleep. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will have got a fright, but in the reality that has no meaning. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This is a positive sleeping disturbance which is called the speech in the sleep. </seg>
<seg id="6"> It is quite spread, above all with the children and youngsters. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Absolutely, it was told more than to one of you that at night you have spoken. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This phenomenon can appear as occasional (once in the life, for example, how during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once per week, once in the month ï¿½), the next day the child can remember nothing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> There is no reason which causes this appearance. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Connections with other phenomena are often searched in the sleep, like nightmares, panic fear at night, Enuresis noctura (bed-wetting at night), speech in the sleep in request, but it gives no reason for it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As we have mentioned it already earlier, it can lie with very much high fiber, stress situations or excessive demand. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Anyway, is the a little investigated phenomenon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The frequency with which it appears is very variable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It can be that one speaks quietly in single words, whispers or it an opposite can completely be (shouts, to wines, long discussions ï¿½). </seg>
<seg id="15"> In the cases if the statement is very intensive it is recommended to observe the child and to let discuss with a specialist to check whether a problem is which causes fear and comes about in this manner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> We have said that it is a positive disturbance, thus it is not treated, it is, it is connected with another sleeping disturbance which can be treated (for example, with the Schlaf-Apnoe or with the stress). </seg>
<seg id="17"> What one is able to do is, a series of easy preventive measures carry out: </seg>
<seg id="18"> Do not try to excite the child before sleeping. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Thus, quiet play for the child select and avoid stressful television programs which are awful and too wild a little bit. </seg>
<seg id="20"> With the nervous children to whom Entspannungen are recommended relaxation methods can be applied to help them, to get a certain internal rest. </seg>
<seg id="21"> This helps the child to sleep quietly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> If the speech seems in the sleep once, the rest tries to preserve. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Remembers that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will be able to remember nothing what has happened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> useful advice </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Do not wake it. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This is useless, because the child is unaware, you will tear it from the sleep. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Although the child speaks, it sleeps, thus it rests. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Remembers if it is scrared after a pair of phenomena, is recommended to let discuss or to find out which reason the child has for the fear. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If they understand what says it (what is not so usual), the child does not put under pressure to carry out an examination and to get out more information. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Thus you will be able to reach with it nothing because if the child sleeps, it is unaware and cannot think about it. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In addition, you will hear what says it, but you will not know what dreams it and why it says this, so, they are carefully with the interpretation of the information and the ends which you pull from it. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Maybe, one does not say to the child that at night you hear this and know his secrets. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Not even as a joke. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This causes a lot of fear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Thus, does to you no worries, it is nothing bad, this is a moment which lasts only few minutes. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Discussion - From the blood that again became sure </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yesterday Hema Quebec celebrated the 10-th anniversary of her foundation, and her president, Dr. Francine Dï¿½cary, had all reason to be glad, because Hema Quebec has become one of the most sure and most efficient blood banks of the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And above all she has the trust of the general public wiedergewonnen which had hard been shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> How one knows, were contaminated by the blood donations service of the Canadian red cross to administered national blood reserves during the 1980s with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In view of this drama and the discontent of the general public the government of Canada in February, 1994 initiated a public investigation escorted by the judge Horace Krever which had to the purpose to bring light in the circumstances which had led to a such tragedy and to work out guidelines to prevent a renewed disaster of this kind. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While judge Krever still hesitated to deliver his report, at that time several provinces put a committee on the legs whose purpose was to develop a new system for the management of units of stored blood in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In Quebec the committee Gï¿½lineau fulfilled this order. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the reports of Gï¿½lineau and Krever two blood banks were founded in Canada: To supply Hema Quebec which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, in order the other provinces and both territories. </seg>
<seg id="9"> ` In 1998, as Hema Quebec her work has taken up, 38% of the people barely had trust in the unit of stored blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Dï¿½cary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was disheartening. </seg>
<seg id="11"> To improve by the huge strains to the security of the units of stored blood and by the work in this area during the following years, we have the trust of the general public won back, she says, before she stresses proudly that in the beginning of 2008 meanwhile nearly 94% of the population of Quebec trust had in Hema Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Nevertheless, Dr. Dï¿½cary keeps in the consciousness that ` trust is something extremely breakable '. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since her foundation on the 28th September, 1998 Hema Quebec acts after the principle of the care. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At this time we seen the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of the cattle insanity in Europe, a new kind Creutzfeldt Jakob-Krankheit, tells this woman who holds in 1998 the management since the foundation. </seg>
<seg id="15"> ` And we did not have the slightest notion whether this illness about the blood could be transferred. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Thus we appealed at one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gï¿½lineau which applies exclusion measures according to one if one does not know this and if an illness progresses only slowly as it is obviously with Creutzfeldt Jakob-Krankheit the case which comments by a degeneration of the brain what leads without fail to the death. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Thus one accepted in April, 1999 no blood of the persons who had stayed since 1980 longer than one month in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Now, some years ago was proved without any doubt that this illness about the blood transfers. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Thus this event has shown us that the principle of the care which we applied absolutely has a sense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In 1999 a lot of more precise technology appeared at the market to the recognition of HIV: The nucleic acid tests (NST) which enable to prove the occurence of the virus independently directly in the blood of the donator and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as it was the case with the tests used up to now. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The NST enabled to shorten the incubation time which takes place between the time at which the person was infected and if the first viruses can be proved by our technologies in the blood, explains the specialist. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Thus became the risk that certain donators could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, reduces substantially. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This improvement enabled, the risk to transfer AIDS about a blood transfusion to lower in substantial litre of beer. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Nowadays one of 12 million persons runs the risk to receive infected blood with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="26"> ` In other words this is called that one would have to distribute 12 million units of stored blood, before somebody would be stuck on with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Because Hema Quebec every year distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 units of stored blood, it would last more than 24 years, before a case appears, with the HIV about an unit of stored blood was transferred. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I believe that, besides, one can feel fine nowadays if one gets a blood transfusion or prescribes to restore the health ', thinks the managerial boss of Hema Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="29"> ` Our challenge for the next ten years is to receive the security of our products. </seg>
<seg id="30"> One never knows which illness cause can reach in the system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Only last year there has appeared on the island Reunion the Chikungunya virus which, just like the Westnil virus, by insects about the blood will transfer. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We must supervise incessantly ', continues Dr. Dï¿½cary, before she stresses that, in addition, Hema Quebec must make available a sufficient care beside a sure care. </seg>
<seg id="33"> ` The need rises because the population grows old. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Because the treatments are more aggressive to the cancer fight, the patients often need new red blood cells or platelets. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor's net to which on average only 3% of the inhabitants suitable to the blood donation of Quebec belong. ' </seg>
<seg id="36"> Besides, can every healthy person who 18 years or is older and which fulfils suitability criteria, all 56 days, thus six times in the year, blood make a donation. </seg>
<seg id="37"> On average 14% of the persons who make available her blood are not accepted because they have fallen ill, for instance, with AIDS or malaria, and who has traveled in a land in which malaria is spread, it is excluded for a year from the blood donation. </seg>
<seg id="38"> ` With these 3% we get to receive an inventory which corresponds to the needs of the hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Lacking stocks are very rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But one must renew the members of this donator's net if they can become older and donate no more blood. </seg>
<seg id="41"> It is difficult to persuade the people, to donate blood, above all, however, to hold them and to bring them, to become regular donators. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Nowadays the life is so hectic that one seldom finds the time to spend one hour with the blood donation ', regrets Francine Dï¿½cary. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With an annual budget of 297 million dollars Hema Quebec delivers not only to units of stored blood, but also human fabrics, under it osseous grafts, heart flaps, eyeballs and skin which is used almost exclusively by heavy fire injuries. </seg>
<seg id="44"> These fabrics are examined, worked on and frozen, before they are interstored with Hema Quebec which also administers the only public umbilical cord blood bank of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In the umbilical cord which was looked earlier than biomedical rubbish is in family cells rich blood which can serve to treat heavy illnesses, as for example leukaemia. </seg>
<seg id="46"> ` Some weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood test, and we plan to take thousand yearly more than. </seg>
<seg id="47"> ` We should probably begin in the beginning of the next year to make available it for transplants ', explains Dr. Dï¿½cary further who describes this program of the umbilical cord blood decrease as very much popularly. </seg>
<seg id="48"> ` Many mothers are persuaded to have no access to it ', because Hema Quebec lacks the means to offer this complicated and costly program in all hospitals of Quebec. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The prime minister does not exclude to initiate choices still before the end of the year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As soon as the general assembly of the liberal party was to an end, yesterday Jean Charest proceeded to Jean talon in Quebec where new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be chosen in the today's partial choice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> ` Shift the course of our last big border in the north ': This is the long-term purpose which Jean Charest introduced yesterday with visual means with the general assembly of the liberal party of Quebec in Levis and he completely followed the guidelines. </seg>
<seg id="5"> During his talk a kind of picture mill was projected behind him. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On three gigantic screens spectacular pictures of hydroelectric power plants, mines, looked turned from Quebec in ` Google Maps', maps, etc. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Big means like during the electoral period. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Compared with the press the prime minister refused, by the way to exclude that he will hold the choices this autumn, even if he allowed to be reported that his appointment calendar is very full. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The ` plan of the north ' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the prime minister has supposedly for Quebec, namely those of a ` new Wirtschaftsraumes' which intends an arrangement with France with regard to manpower, an arrangement between Canada and Europe and arrangements with Ontario. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although it was mentioned in the last time often in the speeches of the prime minister, had been the opening of the north - the northern area on the 49sten degree of latitude - never subject of a presentation. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Nevertheless, the prime minister limited himself to it to explain, why the north is ` a jewel with huge potential ', however, called no date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At most some views of that in which could be worked more: Above all in the water energy, in the wood, but especially in the mining sector, favors above others by the growth of the threshold lands and the renewal of the public infrastructures. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Of the enumeration Mr. Charests according to the north owns ` nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamond '. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This ` area two times largely as France ' ` is in our nearness, is in Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It is not only in our nearness, it is in 'us, he stressed to show how around clear that he tries to realize a national founder's dream. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Quebec has grown very much by his connection with the north, he stressed: the street to the gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James bay. </seg>
<seg id="17"> ` It hears us, it is our future ', he added, after he had inserted a theatrical break to look at the gigantic map behind himself. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The north, 70% of the area of Quebec, encloses a part of Labrador with which Quebec always called, explained the prime minister compared with the press. </seg>
<seg id="19"> ` This is a traditional posture which all governments pursued. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is a borderline in which there is no arrangement since very much long time if the opportunity comes up I will take this posture in the name of the government again ', he explained. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In addition, ` with the climate change we must think over our vision of the north anew ', he explained and spoke about the northwest passage which will be practicable on account of the ice glazes the whole year. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Before this new geopolitical background the prime minister thinks that it is almost a duty to take this area. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit? </seg>
<seg id="24"> The prime minister said that the government of Quebec handled very warily with them, and that they would profit from this project, above all the boys. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Two former ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Lï¿½tourneau (of former pekistischer representatives of Ungava) have already initiated consultations with about thirty communities. </seg>
<seg id="26"> One minister's committee escorted by Benoï¿½t Pelletier in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) takes an important place has taken up the works. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The prime minister does not exclude a big meeting, ` not necessarily a summit ', but an opportunity with which ` one will create a common vision '. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The development of the north will go, for the rest, according to the principles of the lasting development vonstatten. </seg>
<seg id="29"> the plan the north is discussed `, is regulated and environmental-carefully ' be, he promised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Jean Charest described this 'vision', as if it is a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were before him in the office. </seg>
<seg id="31"> ` Like the liberals who were before us in the office we have rethought to transform the challenges into new growth and Entwicklungschanchen. </seg>
<seg id="32"> This was, by the way, one of the subjects pouting over and over again of the week-end which was opened on Friday with a big cocktail party to the celebration of the 50-th jubilee of the takeover of the party guidance by Jean Lesage. </seg>
<seg id="33"> One of the accepted decisions plans to rename the power station of Beauharnois as Adï¿½lard Godbout dam. </seg>
<seg id="34"> ` From Godbout, Hydro Quebec has created, about Lesage which has reached the quiet revolution and the nationalization of the water electricity, to Bourassa which has done the James bay our party knew how always to determine the future ', explained Jean Charest. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Compared with the press he referred to another, this time conservative plan, namely on the program ` Roads to the North ' from John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> In relation on the project Water power dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, stresses Mr. Charest which would be planned his introduction for 2012. </seg>
<seg id="37"> ` This remains among us, but I plan to be present ', he entrusted his party members what caused in those thunderous applauses. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The prime minister who has said in April that there was in 2008, and absolutely also in 2009, no choices, indeed, has the possibility to hold a choice this autumn what is possible to him in accordance with the law, not yet impossible. </seg>
<seg id="39"> He stresses that his appointment calendar is full, nevertheless, above all because of a mission of the communal council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The general assembly of the week-end got the liberal party chief a platform from nationalistic plans, above all from the ` constitution to concerning sighting ' which was accepted just like that: The PLQ particularly demands the recognition of the ` specific feature Quebecs' in the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="41"> She would also like to own that Quebec appoints members of the council of the Canadian broadcasting company and telecommunications and that this a veto with regard to the decisions felled in Quebec. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The guidelines of the plan the north were taken up by sides of the opposition with scepticism. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The boss of the Parti Quï¿½bï¿½cois, Pauline Marois, has brought out the policy for the development of north du Quebec again which has introduced government Landry in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="44"> According to her the liberal government when it came in 2003 to the power has refused to apply this. </seg>
<seg id="45"> If she had done it, ` today we would be already much other ', judged Mrs. Marois at the side of her nominee in Jean talon (where the choice today takes place) Franï¿½oise Mercure. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The ADQ has expressed itself to support the acceptance of a plan the north by the government. </seg>
<seg id="47"> ` But what we want, is that this becomes not only a big image ', explained the party leader Sï¿½bastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont who comes back today from the vacation. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Free opinion - the orwellsche speech of Barrick gold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In her issue from the 17th September Le Devoir published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice general manager of the Canadian golden mine Barrick gold. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms, and, besides, pursues an orwellsche logic that the biggest golden production society of the world aimed at an action for slander more than six millions against three authors and a small impecunious publishing house, with the purpose to open a ` public transparent debate '. </seg>
<seg id="4"> If it is right that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge about the truth, above all not in the case of actions for slander, but about the law. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As expected, this basic difference was completely hid by Mr. Garver. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Since for Barrick gold the best kind a public debate is to be led to do everybody in the ruin which dares to represent one of the opinion opposite to her. </seg>
<seg id="7"> No matter how the process goes out which authors and the publishers of the book Noir Canada substantial sums will have to be economical to prepare her defense and to fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid from the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the golden mine. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The tactics in these unequal fights is often, for the rest to ruin the defenders to force a concerted regulation which silences the opposition and deters, in addition, everybody which dares to deal once more with the question. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If Barrick gold really wanted a public debate, it would have had to present her view of the things before the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By contrast what is quite usual in many of the lands in which Barrick gold works, debates are delivered in Canada ordinarily by the exchange of ideas and not by bat slashes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It would have been enough if the golden mine had disclosed her books and acts and had opened a real debate, by the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams which could have brought light in this question. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But Barrick gold seems to have no trust in the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to the support of the authors of Noir Canada with a movement of the hand aside. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Mr. Garver maybe explain ï¿½ï¿½ß¬ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ can he ask at the same time for a 'public' debate and, besides, nevertheless, the opinions just of this general public ignore? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apparently this word in the world of the vice-president encloses only the generously paid-up lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a quite a lot cramped perception of the concept. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy even slanderers the right have to speak. </seg>
<seg id="16"> What does not understand Barrick gold - or does not want to understand - is that the general public which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this above all, because she rejects the crude posture of the golden mine. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This general public is ready to listen Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a frame which many perceive as a toggle complaint (in the course of the ` public debate ' Barrick gold has directed just a demand to the authors of Noir Canada in whom she requires of them to use this concept no more ...). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Apart from the surreal speech of Mr. Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct attack on the freedom to the academic research and the Wahrheitsfindung which are basically for every democratic society. </seg>
<seg id="19"> She completely denies the right to quote plausible springs and to discuss facts and interpretations which form the base of the intellectual work. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If it is impossible in a land like Canada to investigate subjects and to discuss which the rich enterprises of this world do not like who can do, otherwise, this then? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If Barrick gold really wanted a public and clear debate, it could lead this, while she follows the scientific norms which were used by the authors of Noir Canada. </seg>
<seg id="22"> She has to answer a right. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The universitï¿½re sphere to which we belong knows how to gain control for a long time to solve debates and discrepancies and conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold shows clearly that it, in contrast to that what she gives has no desire for a clear debate. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is a loss for the university world, just like for the public debate, and it time that the governments seize measures will limit the of such type unwarranted complaints. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Yesterday the American finance secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the representative's chamber Nancy Pelosi, and the representative present at the negotiations of the Republicans, senator Judd Gregg, announced, some minutes after midnight, the good news, after a 2-day negotiations marathon. </seg>
<seg id="6"> ` We have done big progress in the direction of an arrangement which will be market-effective ', explained the representative of the management Bush, Henry Paulson. </seg>
<seg id="7"> ` It happened everything to protect the real economy and the American people against the course crisis in the embankment Street ', explained the democrat. </seg>
<seg id="8"> ` This is the basic point: If we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and the riots will be huge in the everyday life of the Americans ', explained Republican Judd Gregg. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The negotiations had accelerated during the last both hours, from fear of the effect which would have had a renewed failure on the mood of the investors. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The term which had been agreed was the market opening this morning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Both American presidential candidates who taken part only late in the negotiations appeared rather than an advocate of the arrangement without missing, nevertheless, expressing her discontent about the fact that one must meet them in this extreme way. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Democratic senator Barrack Obama existed on the addition of certain orders to the arrangement, above all such which should enable to the owners to keep her houses, and such which concern the salaries of the leading employees of the enterprises saved by the state. </seg>
<seg id="13"> ` If one asks the taxpayers to seize extraordinary measures on account of the irresponsibility of certain persons, nothing is what one could congratulate himself on. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But these measures are necessary, he explained on the American television broadcasting stations. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When he was asked on another transmitter whether he is right for the suggested plan, his republican opponent John McCain answered: ` I would know with pleasure only the details, but I hope it. </seg>
<seg id="16"> ` The basic principles which I have read [show that of this one thing is which we will have to digest everything and with which we will be able to make headway. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The option to do nothing at all, is not quite simply satisfactory ', he said. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Of the 700 billion dollar plans is aimed on it, with the money of the taxpayers </seg>
<seg id="19"> He comes 14 months after a crisis, released by burstting of a real estate bubble which led at first to the breakdown of the risky mortgage loans (Subprime), before she expanded on other forms of verbreiteterer loans (PCAA), and, in the end, flowed into a freezing of the financial power and into the ruin of the banks and financial institutions. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It was a group of the republican representatives who allowed to fail the last week the first attempt to the arrangement. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Since the democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of the societies should be protected in distress only by the government and not be bought, one thinks to the dead end escaped. </seg>
<seg id="22"> To round the points of view for everything in the congress, one has also added a possession which says that, if the government with this program should do within five years of losses, she can raise then new taxes to get back thus her used capital. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The new plan intends the payment of the first sum of 250 billions to which other 100 billions can come, if the president looks at it about necessary. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The payment of other 350 billions must be dismissed in a renewed vote by the congress. </seg>
<seg id="25"> As a countermove for his help Washington receives shares in the supported enterprises which introduce dividends in him in the case of profits, and which can resell it if the storm has passed. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Federal Government will have the possibility, the Pfï¿½ndungsverfahren with regard to the apartments which are bound to the real estate loans affected by this plan, to detain, and to settle, in addition, terms for the repayment and the compensations which are paid to the leading employees of the affected enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The developers of the plan would have it with pleasure that the representative's chamber already votes today about him, and the senate then on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In spite of all her efforts is not sure yet that her plan will get green light. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Yesterday really other voices rose against this plan, to sides of the Republicans as well as the democrats. </seg>
<seg id="30"> ` Quite obviously Washington does not understand us ', explained the Republican Scott Garett, member of the finance committee of the chamber, to his voters. </seg>
<seg id="31"> ` Yes, we have a big financial problem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Yes, there are solutions. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But not they who consists in asking the taxpayers to the cash '. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The democratic representative Brad Sherman, leader of a group in the congress which is called ` of the Kaukus of the sceptics ' shows the things differently, however, comes to the same conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="35"> ` 400 excellent economic professors, under it three Nobel Prize Laureates, have written to us to to inform us: We ask the congress not to let put under pressure, and to consider carefully which way is to be smashed ', yesterday he explained. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="2"> His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump, nobody would say, his weakness. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Had the American actor with the winning smile of the narcissistic mirror escaped? </seg>
<seg id="4"> Yes and. </seg>
<seg id="5"> His sensitiveness, his sensitivity and an evident talent have kept away him probably also from a power position which brings the really terrible monsters to the world. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But what of the big long-term runners! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On Friday at the age of 83 years as a result of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut late Paul Newman one of the last icons of the American cinema of the years golden to him remains. </seg>
<seg id="8"> He was less monumental than Brando which he resembled and for which he for a long time a kind of rival on the canvas was certainly also more breakable, more carefully in his play, besides, but just an apostle of the freedom and the Sprengens of dramaturgical conventions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Mixed blood often proves miraculous children. </seg>
<seg id="10"> He was born in 1925 in Ohio as a son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother. </seg>
<seg id="11"> From his European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream should originate. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Without excessive ego, extreme high-class sign. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since in him a whole land was reflected again which was in love in the Self-made-man, in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific war in the battle which studied dramatic art in Yale in the beginning of the 50s and visited then the Actor's studio in New York, before he had success in the theater, on television and soon also in the cinema. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Just this man who fought for the civil rights was also the driver who became in 1979 with the 24-hour running of Mans of seconds, and, in addition, a sex symbol, although he lived together with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a showing respect. </seg>
<seg id="15"> With him also there disappear the unknown facets this mysterious, reserved, engaged and compared with the glamor of the show business to oversensitive stars whose riddle one will completely never solve. </seg>
<seg id="16"> A decent man, in the purest sense of the word. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The death Paul Newmans moved the film lovers this week-end into dizziness, while on the dark screen of the recollections all his big roles were played. </seg>
<seg id="18"> More than half a century of the American cinema in constant change passes with him. </seg>
<seg id="19"> There the winning cowboy from " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid " (1969) crowds again in the memory, and the young man who rejects his sensuous woman (Elizabeth Taylor) in the cat on the hot metal roof which was filmed in 1958 from Tennessee Williams. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The recollection dating back much shorter (1990) is roused which did not fulfil all her promises to his sensitive Mr. Bridge who is disturbed in his old age by a wedding. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So there was a lot of other Paul Newmans in the course of the history. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a handful of mud) from Robert Wise, a role which was intended for James Dean after whose death was taken up again and announced the Newman in 1956 properly. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This likeable crook in the overriding The Sting (chief attraction) who was distinguished in 1973 with the Oskar for the best film. </seg>
<seg id="24"> As a bitter and revengeful billiards player in the miraculous The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), </seg>
<seg id="25"> This face by the times through, this was he. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Still he. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In his life epochs join. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The youth knows him above all from the cult film Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), as a Reggie Dunlop, the a little orthodox coach of a hockey team. </seg>
<seg id="29"> His fans found again him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of brothers Coen. </seg>
<seg id="30"> With the last role in 2003 as a godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes the circle shut. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In contrast to several film legends which have withdrawn early enough from the film world Newman should remain long in the saddle, and betray, besides, Hollywood, his property, his splendor and his concessions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The French film-maker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge in the 'Underplaying' when he judged his much too very expressive achievements. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The profession was not always light for the nice Paul Newman to whom the roles flew for a long time only so. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Nevertheless, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: Neurotiker, alcoholic, creeps or desperate with which perfect representation he reflected his slipping and his backlash. </seg>
<seg id="35"> As a director revealed Newman unknown sides of his true sensitive sensitivity. </seg>
<seg id="36"> His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a subtle women's portrait of full melancholy. </seg>
<seg id="37"> He who lost his son Scott by an overdose dedicated to this in 1984 his film Harry and Son, a work full sensitiveness and sadness. </seg>
<seg id="38"> With the flood of honor which poured forth yesterday about Newman explained his narrow friend and earlier weapon companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid) seized extremely: ` His present has improved my life and this land. ' </seg>
<seg id="39"> Generosity and joy of life were essential qualities of the late actor. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Now apart from his legendary career a big advocate of the civil rights, the environment protection and the independent cinema, an opponent of the leeways of Hollywood also goes, there. </seg>
<seg id="41"> We saw him standing probably often with the foot in bowls fully Vinaigrette, in sauces, pastry or other food, and this for quite tasteless held, although we found it in the beginning still amusing. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The profits from his turnovers still flowed into his endowment for children in need. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Instead of resting on his myth, Newman been involved up to the shot. </seg>
<seg id="44"> He left to his five daughters a letter with these sentences: ` Always and to completely in the end your father was incredibly thankfully for his good star. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It was an honour to may be here. ' </seg>
<seg id="46"> And for us it was allowed to pursue an honour, the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor. </seg>
<seg id="47"> An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and in the farthest sense. </seg>

<seg id="2"> On the 8th October the negotiations begin in the criminal trial against Jï¿½nos surcharge and his accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In particular the participation in the organized crime, as well as roughly careless damage and commercial deception, and other punishable actions - is accused of the defendants, among the rest, document forgery. </seg>
<seg id="4"> According to public prosecutor's office the means lukrierten from the advertisings were used for own purposes, while the produced achievements were often covered with phoney calculations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> State money and subsidies of the self-government - all together HOOF 65 Mil. - should have flowed partly into the cashes of organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the private cashes single. </seg>
<seg id="6"> As the inquiry authorities announced, fictive calculations were presented while covering the advertising money, and the associations should also not have followed to her duties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to indictment a large part of the calculations should have been faked. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The calculation blocks were bought in the market from Jï¿½zsefvï¿½ros, one let the round seals make in Kiskunhalas. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The decision on it on which companies the calculations should be issued was decided on that tour to the north of flat lake on which Istvï¿½n Lados was sent by Jï¿½nos surcharge. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the course of this "investigation tour" Lados pensions and restaurants should find. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He required calculations about the Konsumationen to be able to issue calculations for the youth ministry and sports ministry, the Ministry of social security and Department of Employment, as well as the self-government of Budapest later on these presentations based. </seg>
<seg id="12"> These calculations should go by the majority from Istvï¿½n Lados and his accomplice, Andrï¿½s? have been manipulated ri and should have been responsible latter according to our information for the constitution of the suitable reports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> One of the purposes of Lados' "investigation tour" was a beer bar. </seg>
<seg id="14"> How two calculations issued by Zuschlag und Co in 2003 is to be taken, the catering trade company should have entertained the 90-headed group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesï¿½let. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Now, however, the boss of the company brags, a so big group would not have fitted all at once into the bar. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Another calculation, issued in summer, 2002 on the endowment Working Jï¿½v? ï¿½rt, later famously than Egyï¿½tt a Harmadik ï¿½vezredï¿½rt, showed likewise serious form and contents mistakes. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In a pension in Badacsonytomaj which orders merely more than three rooms and can accommodate no more as ten persons at the same time 130 guests should have stayed according to calculation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> No borders were put apparently also to the imagination of the calculation forgers when it was about the Pigal Kft., a catering trade company, in accounting documents of customers Jobb Jï¿½v? ï¿½rt and Hoppï¿½ only do not appear according to accusation authority at all. </seg>
<seg id="19"> How manager Gy? z? Farkas hvg.hu informed, was clear to him immediately that it concerned phoney documents when documents were presented to him of the public prosecutor's office during questioning. </seg>
<seg id="20"> " Our company name and the tax number were right on the stamp wrong ". </seg>
<seg id="21"> And further: Apart from form mistakes the fact was also wrong that the company should have accommodated 100 persons, after they have a total of eleven rooms which offer place impossibly so to many persons. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Also catering has been stated on the calculation, besides, the restaurant is since longer time no more in company. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The industrious calculation forgers have also neglected to check that from them in the visor taken Budapester travel agency offers exclusively traveling abroad, and thus they have given Hungary traveling on the cash payment calculation what likewise contradicted the calculation lapping practise of the company. </seg>
<seg id="24"> How in the course of the inquiries became known, in addition, they have stated on the calculations also the value added tax, although the travel agency achievements which refer to a land beyond the EU are free of value added tax. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The height of the value added tax was all together on four of hotel Rï¿½vfï¿½lï¿½p Kft to the endowment Working Jï¿½v? ï¿½rt to issued calculations wrong, because the company instead of 25 only 15 percent of VAT settles, in addition, are issued by the employees exclusively machine calculations, nevertheless, the phoney documents were handwritten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Another mistake which had occurred the "Rechnungslegern" was him that they had bragged in a case "goods transport" as a produced achievement, although this is not offered by the company specified on investment consultation, informed the public prosecutor's office. </seg>
<seg id="27"> To other form mistakes - wrong calculation format, wrong stamp - was to be owed, that in Egyï¿½tt a Harmadik ï¿½vezredï¿½rt Alapï¿½tvï¿½ny, as well as in XXI. Szï¿½zadi Kulturï¿½lis Egyesï¿½let and Biztos Pont to issued calculations as forgeries could be exposed. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Also to never have issued the calculations in case of the Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehï¿½rtï¿½ whose managers protested. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Another "mistake" has occurred the forgers with the HIB Kft. from Nyï¿½regyhï¿½za: This society was at the time (2001) since just in resolution when the group of the Fiatal Vï¿½rosï¿½rt Egyesï¿½let should have eaten there - consequently the mass governor indicated not to have issued the calculations independently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Consciously phoney </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The other group him Calculation-casually are persons, to those was absolutely aware that they would have to lay fictive calculations. </seg>
<seg id="32"> On request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjï¿½ Szocialistï¿½k has the endowment Esï¿½ly Budapestï¿½rt Alapï¿½tvï¿½ny calculations for the endowment Egyï¿½tt a Harmadik ï¿½vezredï¿½rt, at a height of possibly HOOF 4 Mil. issued. </seg>
<seg id="33"> According to indictment the manager of the Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gyï¿½rfi, to the exhibit of the fictive calculations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The biogate at the moment likewise located in liquidation Kft. also should go with Zuschlag und Co. have cooperated: In 2003 the Ltd should the endowment Working Jï¿½v? ï¿½rt Alapï¿½tvï¿½ny, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesï¿½let and Vï¿½rï¿½sfeny? Egyesï¿½let with phoney calculations in the total value of HOOF 5 Mil. have supplied which referred to not produced achievements. </seg>
<seg id="35"> However, there were just as few payments, because the calculations were cancelled immediately after her exhibit what the affected persons in her documents, nevertheless, have forgotten to note. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The third group him encloses Calculation-casually persons who are associated immediately with the defendants. </seg>
<seg id="37"> One of them is Ivï¿½n Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian manager the delta Triï¿½ Kft., one in Budapest to resident, there, nevertheless, not discoverable fuel and vehicle business enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="38"> This company should have issued in the period December, 2005 several calculations about the sales of EDP components in the total value of HOOF to about 18 Mil. </seg>
<seg id="39"> According to inquiry authority located Cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas should have acted since the 14th September, 2005 in liquidation as a buyer of these calculations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Manager of this company was a Rumanian to whom the company documents should be likewise blocked by Ivï¿½n Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. </seg>
<seg id="41"> According to our information Kubatov has stood during the inquiries, calculations in the name of the Ltd. to have taken the money to the associations Atlasz and Hoppï¿½, as well as in Egyï¿½tt a Harmadik ï¿½vezredï¿½rt Alapï¿½tvï¿½ny issued and their equivalent independently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft as well as the Jos investment Bt. should have been founded by Roumanian bricklayers on Ivï¿½n Kubatovs explicit wish there. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Nevertheless, in truth none of these companies was active what lay according to defendant with lacking orders. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Still he could profit from the enterprises: On request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente who was instructed with the preparation of the company foundation documents he has exhibited in the name of the proficient calculations to the associations associated with surcharge, as for example in Atlasz and Y-Generï¿½ciï¿½. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> All together Kubatov should have issued 15 calculations in the total value of HOOF 14.2 Mil. in the name of companies Cash Investment, Delta Triï¿½, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The public prosecutor's office assumes from the fact that Kubatov could have collected in each case 10% of the amount payable as well as the value added tax. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Kubatov should have abused even company Szi-Beri Bt for the exhibit of fictive calculations - in this case the calculations were added to the applications by Biztos Pont. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Company Y-Generï¿½ciï¿½ and Szï¿½vetsï¿½g a Modern Magyarorszï¿½gï¿½rt have delivered in January, 2006 her applications at the charitable organization of the socialist party, Tï¿½ncsics Mihï¿½ly Alapï¿½tvï¿½ny ("TMA"). </seg>
<seg id="49"> Both received 500,000 Forint, have used these amounts, nevertheless, misappropriated. </seg>
<seg id="50"> To cover up this, they have presented the TMA five fictive calculations of the Works to team Kft. </seg>
<seg id="51"> These calculations were guaranteed, by the way, by the search of the office from ï¿½ rpï¿½d Kemecsei in the teaching ministry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> Now at the negotiations it is calculated by some defendants with a confession about the approach of the calculation forgery, as they were already filed before the public prosecutor's office. </seg>
<seg id="53"> A sensation could be, if main defendant Jï¿½nos surcharge decides on a comprehensive confession. </seg>
<seg id="54"> His present information was specified since less, and although he had already accepted several times to report extensively about everything, his confession is still pending. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The question stays open whether this lies in his interest whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the reparation of the large part of the resulted damage of HOOF 50 Mil., and whether surcharge is ready as a countermove to take over the responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="56"> However, it is absolutely possible that surcharge plays now the "offended", after his requests had bumped into alleviation of the arrest and house arrest on deaf ears. </seg>
<seg id="57"> While the other criminals who have far arranged bigger damage with economic offenses and have not compensated for this, at large or stand at least under house arrest, surcharge remains this possibility kept. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The psychology of the ï¿½berbietens - or why we are ready to pay more </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> With auctions the buyers incline to be economical more and to overrate the offered for sale therefore. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Now neurologist and economic researchers of the university of New York has succeeded it in discovering the neuro-logically-economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to one in the "Science" magazine Published study the people want to be not hit in a competition, as for example of an auction on eBay, and are ready, therefore to pay even banked prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The researchers have tried to explore the neuro-logical pattern of this "play" with experimental auctions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A group of the volunteers should play lotto, while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the test persons were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> With both plays the participants could win money, indeed, a raised activity of the Striatum, a complex was measured below the cerebral cortex, with losers of the auction at which outbidding the opponent plays an essential role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Beside many other functions this brain region is responsible for the "selfreward" of the nervous system. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Hence, the researchers meant, the price increase can be explained by the avoidance of an over-reaction of the Striatums. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> To underpin her thesis, the small farmers have done investigations to the postpursuit of the money in the research group, in addition. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this case three groups should cooffer against a partner under different conditions. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The true value of the product was informed of the control group, then they have done her applications. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In addition, 15 dollars of reward were promised to another group, for the case that they arise as a winner from the play. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The third group received 15 dollars before the auction which were likewise lost in case of a lost play. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The difference between both groups merely consisted in the fact, that the stress with one on the profit, while lay with the others on the losing. </seg>
<seg id="16"> However, as a proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists the members were ready " against the losing " playing group for higher applications, than that in Controlling one or the "Gewinn" group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> " These results can be derived from no earlier economic theory. </seg>
<seg id="18"> These have since the behaviour patterns observed at auctions up to now only with the joy at the profits, or the risk avoidance reasonably. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The contradiction between these both theories was dissolved thanks to the picture-giving neuro-logical procedures, so that we have now the third explanation ready " - Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic faculty of the university of New York meant. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Worldwide suffer around half a billion people from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver illness is listed under the leading causes of death. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The number of the infected is estimated in this country at hundred thousand, however, only 7000 are treated what is due to the fact that the patients often do not know that they are infected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver illnesses released by different viruses. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The symptoms are often similar - hepatitis and jaundice are frequent, indeed, the causes and the illnesses differ of each other. </seg>
<seg id="6"> According to cause the hepatitis viruses in two different kinds spread: with hepatitis A and E by the digestive tract (for example, by dirtied food or waters), with hepatitis B, C and D the viruses can be transferred by blood and other body liquids (as for example sperm, dissolution secretion or saliva). </seg>
<seg id="7"> A vaccination is recommended to traveler against the viruses A and B, in any case, against the virus C there is no vaccine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The symptoms with hepatitis A appear about two three weeks after consumption of the dirtied Lebensmittels and are accompanied generally by unwell-being, weakness, stomachaches and nausea. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Then the jaundice on the skin and in the eyes appears, the chair is getting light, the urine darkly, and the recovery can last up to during two three weeks. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Worldwide about 1 Mil. people dies yearly in of hepatitis B to released, far heavier illnesses like liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Principal reason for this is that estimates is according to only every tenth infected in medikamentï¿½ser treatment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Also hepatitis C can have serious results: untreated it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Most infected not even know about her illness, because the cause destroys the liver cells perfidiously - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Hence, timely preventing, as for example regular controlling investigations, is essential. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There are three groups in which this illness seems more often: that which have undergone before 1991 of a blood transfusion, drug dependent, and tattooed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Nowadays the number is estimated in chronic hepatitis C ill worldwide at 200 Mil. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Because the illness is already provable with a routine lab investigation, it is advisable to visit the family doctor with the first signs of unknown origin. </seg>
<seg id="18"> On time recognized, the illness is remediable which can be exterminated virus by which the infection danger is banished and the origin by cancer is bent forward. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> 30th September is the world day of hepatitis, in 2004 for the first time from patient's representations worldwide organized. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Believers have less pains? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> How the newest research results prove that the religious faith works like a kind of "painkiller" which should already have made easier the death of Catholic martyrs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Scientists Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It was examined, to what extent the faith in God influences the pain feeling of the person, the British sheet of "telegraph" announced. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the course of the rather weird investigation received 12 believers and atheists electroshock therapies, while they studied a painting of the mother of God. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the results pointed, the believers could switch off the large part of pains. </seg>
<seg id="6"> By means of a Brain-scan technology could be even proved that the Catholics could activate the part of her brain which is responsible for the pain regulation. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The investigation was first in a research project in which beside scientists also philosophers and theologians of different departments of the university take part. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> With the attempt a sparkling device was bound the test persons to the left hand which delivered the electroshock therapies. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The participants were asked to concentrate strongly upon two paintings: On the one hand, a picture of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17-th century, and to the other Leonardo there Vincis " lady with the ermine ". </seg>
<seg id="10"> The researchers hoped that the sight of virgin Maria would cause a kind of religious trance among the believers, while they selected there Vincis picture because it barely differed from the other painting and than was felt reassuringly. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The experimental subjects spent half an hour in a scanner MRI, and received a total of 20 electroshock therapies in four stages in this time, while they should look either at the religious, or at the other painting. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Catholics reported, they would have felt at the sight of the mother of God " in security ", as if they were "looked", and they would have felt " rest and peace ". </seg>
<seg id="13"> During the Betrachtens of the religious painting they have reported more than 12% less pains, as if they had Leonardos work with eyes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The psychologist Miguel Farias who likewise took part in the attempt meant, one could cause similar effects also with other, very active pictures also in the atheists, one would have to find only the suitable photo. </seg>
<seg id="15"> " We would have to find a picture which releases very positive sensations, as for example a mother or a father ", according to the psychologist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Anglican bishop Tom Wright greeted the results of the research. </seg>
<seg id="17"> " Carrying out the belief should change our personality, and does it also in many cases ", according to Wright. </seg>
<seg id="18"> After these excellent results only the question remains which effect a Madonna's picture Leonardos or another comparable painter on the pain regulation of the believers would have. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Would qualitatively high-quality virgin Maria still become better results achieve? </seg>

<seg id="9"> For example, "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows to the visitor to store his own searching course and to fall back later on it, so that the hits can be generated later much more exactly, and on the same logic the so-called "Recommendations" with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services on account of the earlier preferences are also based. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> However, the users ask themselves what happens in case of a data abuse - " If one looks what I do " - some are concerned whether of the Google-data mono pole. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Nevertheless, in most cases it is rather the potential power represented by the company which looks horrific, and less the feeling of guilt or the fear of punishment, the striving for freedom or the clamour against the power which bumps with many Internet users into refusal. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, it is a proved fact that the search words not only are stored, but are transmitted in the occasion case also into three parts, and in these law cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A prime example for this was recently the action against Pï¿½dophilie in Brazil in the course of whose Google of the Brazilian government handed information which was collected by the communal site called "Orkut" and also allowed an identification of the Pï¿½dophilien. </seg>
<seg id="14"> However, around personal rights concerned users could draw a deep breath still in May when Google moved together with civil right organization EFF successfully against the FBI in court: therefore, Google can be also made in future with no point of the constitution publish information to the FBI on confidential inquiry. </seg>
<seg id="15"> (Indeed, the Federal Government has obtained successfully the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search words with reference to the protection of children and young people law adopted years ago, indeed, became to her the list of the single users, or keep their web and search word list for two months retrospectively.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Googles image remains controversial: Those which publish her personal data reluctantly because they fear the loss of her private sphere and intimate sphere by the use of the Google services castigate the enterprise with the outrage being due presenting to the conservatively companies. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Meanwhile sees the American "Geek culture" which is present in many lands and eager computer fans, activist and user unites, which the next generation of the " cool enterprisers " in them, in contrast to Microsoft which is a market leader thanks to Windows, even if both fight for the same purpose. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> A possible reason for this is that Google demands of his users in contrast to Microsoft no identification codes, and makes available his services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be cooler far attractive, more in a juvenile manner and, than the official methods of the software giant. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the other hand, the Geeks the problematic relation of the personal rights and the Internet look though shrewdly - a relation which has moved in particular during the past years thanks to the concept " web 2.0 " in the center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> With the " web 2.0 " it is since about nothing else than speak around collaboration, the users leave intentionally tracks and use the available communication canals, and also if the magnitudes are different individually, the central issue remains the same to be public since. </seg>
<seg id="21"> An average youngster can administer at the same time on several communal main entrances his profile - from Facebook via Xanga, this can by means of other services, as for example Twitter, or music services like last.fm with each other connect, and can integrate all this, in the end, into a postpursuit system as for example FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead Blogs which show the newest photo galleries automatically which are geocontinual on Flickr or Picasa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> And a row of other exemplary cases proves: While looking the party photos of the last night the friend soon finds out with whom her disloyal friend has enjoyed himself, or the employee will dismiss because he gives vent in his Blog only much too honestly to his annoyance about the enterprise guidance - one is sure: The concept "Private sphere" was interpreted meanwhile totally anew. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Who leads an on-line life, is that what he reveals of himself - thus in possibly one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of the today's youth. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And who tries to keep secret something, or to handle even the Google monopoly, this can act with pleasure - as for example with Scroogle, a tool which accesses, indeed, the searching machine of Google leaves, indeed, intentionally no tracks. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Not few people do not register intentionally on communal sides, so that they are not discoverable, but also the on-line applications of Google, as for example word processing and graphic tools and RSS-Feeds, can handle with alternative versions which are bound to no gigantic server parks and do not generate, hence, also the best possible profile of the user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The public opinion waits meanwhile fascinatedly for it, to Google her true face points. </seg>
<seg id="27"> With her present value of 156 USD of Bn. the enterprise lies even before IBM (140 USD of Bn.), the income of the advertising agencies threatens Intel (124 USD of Bn.) or Coca Cola (110 USD of Bn.), the advertising surfaces of AdWords/AdSense, and the faster and faster introduced services prepare not only Microsoft, but also to other software developers brainwork. </seg>
<seg id="28"> However, critical viewers also find the disconcerting counterpoles: Thus possibly the group management has totally rejected a protest of the employees, after the fees of kindergarten belonging to companies were doubled, in addition, the management thought, the repeated catering of the employees is too costly. However, all that seems virtually mildly against the fact that Google went in 2006 before the Chinese government even to the knees and agreed with an arrangement, after which all regime-critical hits, or those which would be filtered out against the good taste expelled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The internal regulation of the group is that in Ahead no new service is promoted, but only if this is also quite available. The events of the coming months and years could still turn up something again hard: During some mean, Googles book mass and project Magazinscan or archiving project supposes meanwhile magnitudes that the enterprise soon had to argue with the uppermost court of law, are disturbed other rather because of the system "Health" which allows the production of a complete health profile on the basis of findings, doctors and problems. </seg>
<seg id="30"> And the Sci Financial Accounting authors already the material - possibly "Scroogled" delivers the fact that Google builds up a genetic data bank to the next generation, famous Roman von Cory Doctorow describes in the best orwellschen manner a future in which a person becomes alarmingly close-cash thanks to data referring by Google. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> What would be the best method of the development of new technologies on the accident avoidance, if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from the nature? </seg>
<seg id="3"> For example, those of the bees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With the CEATEC in Japan an astonishing project with which the Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees with the creation new accident of avoiding systems was introduced. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In collaboration with the Tokioter university Nissan has built the biomimetische system steered by autorobots of the type BR23C, a mini-car, equipped with the qualities of the bees, with the purpose to support the development of a system which avoids any collisions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the flight every bee forms her own, oval "private area" which is very similar to our own "shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, with the exhibit. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Besides, the compound eye of the bee which can see in every direction and in a corner of more than 300 degrees plays an important role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> To copy the function of the compound eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-steered distance knife. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates her distances and sends signals to the microprocessor in Board which initiates immediately the collision-avoiding process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The obstacle is registered in split seconds, and the autorobot changes immediately the course, like the movement of the bees, while he turns the tyres around the suitable corner. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In contrast to present systems this manoeuvre takes place purely instinctively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> " If it was not in such a way, the autorobot could not react fast enough to make way to the obstacles ", explained Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of "Mobility Laboratory" and the autorobot-project. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The system must react instinctively and immediately, because this technology corresponds to the most internal and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents count nowadays still as inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees if they make way to other bees. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And this must run off in the fraction of one second. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Indeed, the elusiveness, in contrast to the bees, not can occur up, down, or even diagonally - it can be two-dimensional only, namely only in the direction of the Wendbarkeit of the tyres. </seg>
<seg id="17"> While many possibilities are open to the bees here endlessly to make way to other bees, the researchers could help themselves with the autorobot only of the rotary movement, or the acceleration and Abbremsens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BR23C contains lithium-polymer batteries which are light and more energy-efficient, and, hence, have a longer life span, than customary lithium-ion batteries. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Andoh explained, it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of the data, and still less on the ability on storing this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> This device must process per second merely some input and react accordingly to them. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It must not store this, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction with the help of earlier manoeuvres, so that it takes up constantly only a handful of KB Memory. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It requires no heavy to gigabyte and memo ream heavy to megabyte. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology which will be according to appraisal of Nissan within the next ten years serially in production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> An other application could find the technology with the satellite navigation GPS, while it steers the driver consciously round obstacles and leads him thus in the purpose. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Now the written version of the 700Mrd dollar of heavy rescue parcel-law is which shall be applied in several stages and is aimed at the buying of the bad loans of the banks. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the first passageway half of the money should be given. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> By a meeting which came to an end on Saturday after midnight local time east coast the congressional representatives have brought after debates of several days to an arrangement on the 700-billion dollar of heavy rescue parcel, announced Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> " We have achieved essential progress ", said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the American chamber of deputies, and meant, one must only write down the arrangement. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain supported the achieved compromise about the rescue parcel. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Minister of Finance Henry Paulson meant about the result: The program will show effect and it becomes efficient, however, one must act even more. Here according to Pelosi it would be not about the rescue the embankment Street, but therefore, the oar of the economy rumzureiï¿½en. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The written version of the parcel was still published before the opening of the Asian markets, thus, Washington time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), however, has released no high-altitude flight on the stock exchanges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On Monday the chamber of deputies about the law draft votes first to the stabilization of the economy of 2008, then the senate is in the row. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday evening with Pelosi, and also the White House greeted the news about the arrangement. </seg>
<seg id="11"> We are contented with the at night achieved progress and estimate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> However, the program deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush's administration after which the 700 Bn. dollars should be spent all at once on the buying more decayed, with loans of loaded securities. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In the first Tranche half of the 700-billion amount should be given at most and 250 Bn. are available immediately, after the congress will vote as expected on Monday about the Causa. This sum should be used for the buying of loan-loaded, bad securities, and the president should decide on the other 100 Bn. USD. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The program is checked by own committee to which also the president of the Federal reserve belongs. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Other half of the 700 Bn. depends on an other decision of the congress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> For the purposes of the law the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactics: It can do at the same time bad loans, mortgages, and with mortgages loaded securities buy, or also other "toxic" loans. </seg>
<seg id="17"> As responsible persons of the ministry reported, the buying can occur in an auction, as well as directly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The law enables to the affected companies to take part in an insurance program with which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the alarming means, and which pay enterprise to the damages to be expected suitable fees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means in such a way that can be made available up to 700 Bn. dollars as an emergency relief for the American financial system, it is for the largely invested buying of bad means, her assurance, or the avoidance of a system risk which is released by the collapse of a bigger financial institution. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We put the necessary steps, so that we are ready for the introduction of the law, as soon as it was signed, according to Paulson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> However, the bosses in difficulties advisable and now on state help to instructed banks can calculate on the fact that her dispatches which are called in the oversea slang casually " Golden Handshake " are shortened by the government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> There will be a shortening of the salaries only in certain cases, and these shortenings will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps out in each case. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The shortening means in the essentials that if the ministry buys within the scope of an auction, thus the " Golden Handshake " is taxed, is pushed away unless, the retired bank boss in the pension. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In case of a direct buying of the decayed loans the government will intervene aggressively to make sure that the manager's salaries are not exaggerated. </seg>
<seg id="25"> To the picture also belongs that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions refer only to new arrangements, so that the more people take part in the program. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This is the first case in the American history that shortenings are regulated on manager's salaries by law, commented democrat Barney Frank, chairperson of the finance committee, the measure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> The state wins participation rights in the participant banks, so that the risk sinks for the taxpayers, because they can also take part, as soon as to the economy and with it also the saved bank is better again. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The law draft intends that the president must present to the congress during the next five years a suggestion as the taxpayers should get back her lost money from the finance sector again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> However, there was on both sides sceptic which have expressed her doubts in relation on the plan. </seg>
<seg id="30"> This is not that what the American citizens expect from us, the plan on no account protects the money of the taxpayers, according to the California Republican Darrell Issa. </seg>
<seg id="31"> His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur meant: The measures were sped up by the same persons who are also responsible for the collapse the embankment Street. </seg>

<seg id="2"> By the choices on Sunday no representative of the opposition has created it in the Ukrainian parliament. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Russian observers mean, this lies with the prosperity and stability in the land controlled by Alexander Lukashenko, however, the OECD supposes unlawful acts with the counting up of the voices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The OECD which has sent 450 observers from 43 lands has not recognized the choices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Indeed, De legislation of the 10-millions-inhabitant's state gets by since decades without opposition. Gathered opposition has still seriously expected itself under the name " combined democratic forces " (ODS) before the yesterday's choices that Lukashenko who renewed in 2006 his presidency mandate by the squalid choices and thanks to a constitutional amendment already for the fourth time would "admit" this time some representatives of the opposition in the parliament. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Therefore, the ODS has forborn even from the before planned boycotts. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Ukraine becomes economically more and more dependent thanks to the rising prices with the natural gas import of Russia. For the relief of the prize increases even loans were taken up, and the land has also agreed to the disposal of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the land, to the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition there stood hope, the Ukraine wants to improve her relation with the EU, after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have entry ban because of the anti-democratically classified political system in the EU. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The evaluation report of the choices of the OECD in which the stress lay rather on the positive movements, instead of on the defects - as for example the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates of the choices - provided for a passing relaxation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Indeed, the quick report of the OECD already on Monday criticized the campaign - therefore, members of the opposition might not seem in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition might not be present with the counting up of the voices. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="10"> In spite of all that the opposition is capable of an improvement in the political system recognize: Political prisoners were put possibly on free foot, and Minsk is ready even for smaller confrontations with Moscow, while it was refused furthermore the recognition of the independence of the unfaithful Georgian provinces Sï¿½d-Ossetien and Abchasien, although Russia with which the Ukraine on the paper forms a Fï¿½derativstaat looks at both areas since one month as independent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> " We have done two steps forward and backward, but the most important is that the dialog has begun between Byelorussia and the EU ", said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our sheet. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In the opinion of the opposition candidate of the presidency choices of 2006 a continuation is desirable, although " have got the mighty fear to let even a member of the opposition in the parliament ". </seg>
<seg id="13"> The opposition plans no protest measures in view of the results, but tries to make clear rather the necessity of an economic reform to the voters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> " We have to fight here with many problems - the oppositional newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities lay stones in the way to us with the distribution, but still I see that more and more people support the change, even older " - Milinkewitsch said in allusion on the fact that the most-supported layer of the pensioners not even agrees with the Lukashenko's regime whose only salary is the production of social security. </seg>
<seg id="15"> " Thanks to the indebtedness of the land and the increase of the commercial deficit it is only a question of the time to which to the silence of a cemetery reminding " social security " starts to crumble ", according to Milinkewitsch. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Nevertheless, actually, these attacks do not have to say a lot; it concerns racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; everything says that Obama with a big projection wins. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Also in this case the people who speak with the heart and not with the head are there. </seg>

<seg id="9"> It concerns a problem which must be solved? so the interviewed journalists? if one wants to prevent that the traditional journalism, as the big audience understands him, shrinks not substantially. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Today a clear, but complex pessimism fulfils the American journalist. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Six of ten journalists and Executive of boss of the printing press are of the opinion that the journalism on national level on the wrong way is. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In the local area these are with the Executives even to 65%. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="14"> It is not difficultly for the journalists to fancy itself to which direction the web goes. </seg>

<seg id="17"> 500 interviewed journalists have admitted wanting to join to the new technology, in hope " she brings something good for the journalism ". </seg>
<seg id="18"> The biggest tear exists in the American journalism today between the editors in chief newsroom and the reporters who work for them. </seg>
<seg id="19"> 56% of the editors in chief on national level are sure, her reporters divide her values with them, while there are only 23% at local level. </seg>

<seg id="24"> Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In a gigantic nation, as it the USA are, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio stations and TV transmitters and Internet operators, the employers offer like they like and thus it becomes a question from take it or leave it. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The editors in chief very often get very much high wages, the editor against it can get now and again only 10,000 euros per month, in addition pension money and insurance money. </seg>

<hl>
<seg id="1"> The ï¿½lite is in danger </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The phenomenon had itself already some days ago reveals when the representative's chamber was right against the 700-billions dollar-savings parcel of the White House: Of a big part the American was and is interested more to punish the embankment Street than to save the economy. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms the yesterday's issue New York Times which reports about how the crisis divides the republican party in the run which to itself more and more splits in her old and moderate East Coast soul which always favored the state institutions and business community and that neoconservative one which faces " to those in Washington " and the financial world hostilely and wins v. a. in the south and the center of the states voter. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This part of the party owes his rise v. a. of the voice of that which I mentioned on top. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This just mentioned example is meanwhile only a small part of the big changes which the momentary economic earthquake announces or even already explains: not only in the USA, also in the whole west and maybe also after this will be concerned by these. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the states as well as in Europe the crisis seems to accelerate the long expected events which accept, finally, figure under these new conditions and come to light. </seg>
<seg id="7"> First of these phenomena the new discovery, the incredible Renaissance of the state is in connection with a kind of Renationalisierung of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Indeed, the crisis signifies a decline of the bank ions and financial institution ions which narrow connections with the foreign country own and administer at the same time an immense amount of the property from private house holds which live in one single state. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This signifies an immediate political problem for the governments: namely as it is a matter to behave in accordance with the affected families which show also a huge electoral mass. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The crisis seems global economically, political against it she is almost purely national. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The political internationalism seems to have got thus to itself in the offside and his speech right to have lost: The clear proof for this has been given by the EU which knows how to find no common way on account of her division in two parts in different national and international conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now, hence, everything count on the intervention of own state; rescue plans, new rules, and v. a. Distribution of auxiliary fund: Since the crisis became more and more serious, merely the USA are to be escaped in the economic position without foreign help. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And, in addition, beside the means they also own the legitimization this to use: therefore two not too ï¿½berwertende conditions? under certain circumstances? on which usually probably no international organization and no market will be able to fall back in similar way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> That new stress which is laid on the state-national element is, for the rest, in perfect harmony with the bigger and bigger meaning which is associated recently in the economy with one on the narrowest related sector: the Territorialitï¿½t. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Just now of paradoxical way it is when we however, thus is convincing were to have entered for a long time into a linked up whole empire, in an empire of the always differentiated technologies, the immaterial that we must find out all at once how our future depends, nevertheless, more and more on the essentially material things: Water, harvest and oil. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Indeed, these can be transported indeed everything by a place in the other of the world, are connected, however, still on extreme with a narrowly umschriebenen piece of earth? to a territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Hence, that is which disposes of such a territory, another towards which lives free area, in the advantage in without crop, without water or from oil occurence. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Now I come to the second novelty which assumes, nevertheless, a short Einschub. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Who says territory, who government who says policy with it also Leader-hip. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In this sense the financial crisis seems to generate two converging phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the one hand is there the knowledge about the necessity respectable Leaderships, thus the need for somebody who knows how one regulates the things. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Now on the other side exists a wave of the indignation about the existing guidances, v. a. that of the economy which have turned out insufficient and full shadow zones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> There there comes, in the end, a deep passing and in certain sense even more disconcerting aspect: A trust loss, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of the distance which is all directed on a whole class of managers of the western lands. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It seems to make a way thus the conviction under big parts of the population the way that these are not only the actions of the social ï¿½lite, but already her world of ideas, her Way of Life, her culture in the farthest sense of the word, whose salary explains to the majority as more and more foreign and overcome. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The inquiry after Leader-hip feeds underground a branched however mighty movement of the loss of power of the leading class and the customary political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the abrupt change of the collective state of mind of the last time: here beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the breakdown of the Labour party in Great Britain, there to the rebellion of the American representatives against Bush (and maybe the victory of the rights in Italy also plays a role). </seg>
<seg id="26"> One wins the impression as if the old ï¿½lite has, her parties, her programs, but also her rites, magazines, to intellectual believers, some one would say her format, more and more understanding problems and, hence, less representative value with regard to that what proceeds nowadays in the lower social layers of the west and is still strengthened by the financial crisis and is done up to ï¿½berdimensionalitï¿½t. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In view of all his one it would be simply exaggerated to speak of a " rebellion of the masses ". </seg>
<seg id="28"> However, the eyes is not to be kept open far meanwhile certainly. </seg>

<seg id="3"> According to the last investigation of the Sunia, the tenant's trade union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> " This phenomenon has already accepted very serious trains. Whole crowds of students lose so actually her right to study, because her families are not able to support them by this height "? so the person responsible of the Sunia, Laura Mariani? " in these towns the big inquiry leads on the part of the students to a deformation of the market which has also damaged the other inhabitants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Besides, most rent offers contain a row of offense: free contracts, missing registrations, without rent price border, unauthorised unterrents. </seg>
<seg id="6"> For the Sunia the necessity exists after the unusual measures which lead by a reworking of the taxation for lower rent prices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In case of more precise consideration of the investigation turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the quarter Brianza approx. 450 euros are needed; a single room begins with 650 euros (in the quarter volumes Nere) and Vittoria ends with 800 euros in the quarter Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the quarter. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In Florence a sleeping place costs on an average 350/400 euros, a room 700. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In Bologna where the students concentrate in the quarters around the university 2,50/,280 euros are for a sleeping place of miseries, 370 to 500 for a single room. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In Rome the prices lie in the quarters around the university with about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Only a little more deeply the rents are in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittï¿½. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Only who makes way in outlying districts money can save: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar accommodations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> In Naples need one 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price lies between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In the smallest towns the prices are lower, however, they have a bigger weight in the urban economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the towns in which the phenomenon of the renting is more frequent to non-European students as for example in Perugia, exists even an other anomaly: rents which lie about 25-30% above average are demanded of foreign students. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso? the towns close her historical film halls </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The historical cinemas close on account of the preferred multiplex cinemas. </seg>
<seg id="3"> " A town without film halls is a blind town, how a face without eyes. " </seg>
<seg id="4"> This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes what at the moment in the big urbane centers of Italy with effect, and also happens in the provinces. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The process of the exclusion of the cinemas which began with the birth of the big multi hall complexes in the periphery signifies in the long term the death for the Einsaalkino in the center. A process which seems inevitable not only and irrevocable but also the trains of a cultural crime carries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Mostly historical places of full recollections are concerned, " it is like a friend to lose with whom one has put back a piece of street of full emotions ", according to the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso who introduced the Oskar and the big price of Cannes in him 20 years ago. It concerns the history of a suburban cinema and his nostalgia which insists on living in a probably film world lost for good. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The figures which speak the Anec which delivers central trade federation, a clearly language: during the last five years had to close the immense amount from 316 traditional cinemas; the cinemas paid for the most part this bill in the big towns: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed from Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41 belong to the strongest affected regions. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This testifies of the fact that the major offenders are the multiplex cinemas, because these are just these three regions in which the biggest number of these modern cinemas was registered: with 195 during the last 5 years Lombardy states the lists, 81 are it in Tuscany as well as in the Emilia-Romagna. </seg>
<seg id="10"> " The business has developed in an irrational way ", indeed, thus Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, " it helps that also new structures arise, however, firstly, there stands the preservation of the quite existing, then a hall closes in the town, all his regular customers are ready not to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And here the missing budget still remains for the ground of the trade federation ï¿½uï¿½er Eight: the debts registered by the state amount to approx. 10 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a disgrace of the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not follow the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="13"> To receive the sector, would be between 16 and 18 million euros in the year of miseries ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian town which has decided on account of the fears around the old film halls to protect this by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it concerns the first agreement of this kind in Italy which is designed to protect the traditional cinemas and to support, and this in the historical center, as well as in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Under the foreseen measures tax Bevorteilungen are also for the film operators as well as advantages for the audience with regard to the close traffic: it will be allowed to go in the traffic-limited areas of the center and to park, in addition, to more favorable park fees. </seg>
<seg id="16"> " It is a gratifying initiative ", according to Giuseppe Tornatore, " I hope that other towns to our example will join and sketch, in addition, still new drafts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Indeed, however, we also need a better audioequipment and videoequipment to be able to straighten something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because today, in the end, the audience from is more demanding. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The defense of the traditional cinema has been for me always an important subject: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point which brought me, to found "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even if I had already played for 10 years with the thought. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For 25 years I live in Rome; if I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside not to have to see the dust-overcast posters. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The connections between policy and ' Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> " The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The accusations of the bar of the anti-mafia-authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of municipality Gioia Tauro which were arrested this morning because of involvement in mafia shops are serious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In handcuffs was also taken Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public management, as well as his nephew: the lawyer who carries the same name like the boss of the clan had been already condemned because of involvement in criminal unions of the mafia, at that time to an amount of damages of 10 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> " Every kind of moral and juridical norm ignoring ", so write the lawyers, " had decided both local management, which to pay lawyer Piromalli money for consultation operations. " </seg>
<seg id="6"> " Therefore it had been made the mafia group possible? so the judges? to penetrate on official way into the city halls and to have an influence on the policy of the public management. " </seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> The president of the regional committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not say no that it is in his region " anything but an exception to bump into connections of local management and the organized crime.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The arrests from this morning follow those from the last July with which according to the police the clan Piromalli was beheaded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since end of the last April the district council had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro, however, already in 1991? and also at that time on account of supposed connections between organized crime and the local management? if the local politicians of her local authorities had been relieved. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From a listening action in connection with the investigations to the case Dal Torrione, the readiness has appeared to meet the wishes of an enterpriser who is as is known a representative of the big group around the Piromalli by which the measures of the public management became identically with the interests of this clan.

<seg id="1"> If the energy arises from the waves, the tallness suddenly accumulates </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is a not drying up monetary spring which covers more than 70% of the surface of the planet and only now the big energy companies of the world seem to understand this. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources on now everything look, and also try to occupy, possibly giants like chevron. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The possibility to win energy from the movements of the sea is already considered for 70 years and is examined; not by chance these studies intensified since the first oil crisis substantially. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the price of the oil about 1980 broke gasify one the idea of the sea energy, now, however, the environmental organizations and the risen oil price press for new impulses in this sector. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the worldwide power demand could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This would amount to the double of the energy at the moment produced by nuclear power stations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition, there still the currents and tides would come. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Giants in the attack. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The first company which places now on the sea energy is Enersis which has signed in 2005 a contract to the establishment of a power station in the north of Portugal. </seg>
<seg id="11"> When this news was published it seemed to concern a revolutionary step. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now two years later these are more and more companies from the traditional energy branch which place on the marine power production. </seg>
<seg id="13"> " Chevron examines these technologies "? so the speaker of an enterprise known to the US-American giant in the Wall Street Journal? and if the possibility weighs to cooperate from with us. " </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is, on this occasion, about the procurement of a licensing of the American energy committee which is necessary to begin a project before the coast of Alaska. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This is a sign not to be underestimated, v. a. if one thinks that just in Alaska furthermore oil is promoted through the USA and president Bush recently got going only the plans for new drillings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Beside chevron are also the proficient Verdant Power Inc from New York and Ocean power from New Jersey which invest in the new branch; if the details are also not known, nevertheless, observers speak of a rising interest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Still improvement-worthy technologies. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Experts speak not least of a technology still being in the departure, this, because yet the last doubts are not cleared by sides of the environmentalists. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Up to now projects are like that in Portugal and also Scotland of rather small dimension and seem to cause no ecological problems to be taken seriously. </seg>
<seg id="20"> To produce, nevertheless, energy on a large scale, it requires technologies with far bigger influence on the environment. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There are different possibilities: Ocean power possibly uses a system of buoys linked with each other. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The push of the waves which move the buoys on and down is converted within the swimmers about piston and cylinder into hydraulic pressure. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This drives a turbine which pursues a generator again. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The stream is sent on it about unterwater pipes to the coast. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Till present there are four planned arrangements of the this kind which wait only for the state approval. A part of the won energy could also serve for military equipment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Verdant power produces meanwhile already energy for a goods department store and a park bib with the help of unterseeischer turbines in the East River of New York. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The water movements during the tides drives the turbines which feed the generator by the originating rotary movement. </seg>
<seg id="28"> According to Verdant a long queue of possible clients already waits for the necessary Autorisierungen around these energy sources to be of use. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Only the waves, then the tides. </seg>
<seg id="30"> A special interest earns according to the institute of stream production research presently the potential which is in the tides. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Although it also concerns an irregular phenomenon, nevertheless, the tides are better predictable as wind currents, of the solar irradiation and also the waves, and, hence, a trustworthier stream spring. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It is just the tidal energy which federal states made like New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states invest already 7.5 million dollars in 2008? for 2009 are already planned up to 35 millions. </seg>
