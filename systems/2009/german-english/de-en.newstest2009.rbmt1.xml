<seg id="46"> " In fact therefore, because one doesn't know, through which mechanism and about which price the problematic assets are bought up. </seg>
<seg id="47"> That will be for it decisively, as the finance-sector and the government apportion " the losses among each other, Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Whether now the plan or beginning of next week is given a farewell, is not crucial according to Mareks opinion. </seg>
<seg id="49"> It is " much more important that the congresspersons agree on it to support the plan and that she/it him/it as fast as possibly gives a farewell. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The psychological meaning of the agreement over it, that a dismissal occurs, the most important ", emphasized Marek, is in this moment. </seg>

<hl>
<seg id="1"> Duel on knife's edge: MP3-Player against Handys. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> We discuss you with your election </seg>
<seg id="3"> While each Handy MP3-Dateien can almost play, no MP3-Player can still telephone. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Therefore it looks of course so that it is better, itself only one telephone, to buy. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Despite all, there are reasons for it sufficiently why they should get itself an autonomous Player. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The election depends the prospective proprietor on the type of the utilization and the claims completely. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Certainly, one hardly buys itself for at home a great expensive record player in order to be able to tell by the sound the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc of itself on it. </seg>
<seg id="8"> First such musical newness don't appear on LPs, and from qualitative view, there is also no objective reason for it. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Have LPs with type skirt, jazz or blues in the shelf however, you dream of a such probably at least. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So, that is also expressed simplified with the music on trips, therefore with compressed music, - music in the MP3-Format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also here, there are price - and quality-categories. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For the one, it is not acceptable maybe to pass out eight-thousand crowns for a Player, as well a Pink-Floyd-Fan will probably come to terms with headphones for twenty crowns of the market hardly however. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Two extremes, between which there is area for any enough. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The selection is gefächert broadly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Also the lifespan of the batteries is crucial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some good Music Player can play much more than only music, but they manage that, which Handyses can, not once in passing. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern appliance is as universal as the telephone to start. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Beside the primary functions, telephoning and him/it ledges, it can return music and videos, both lifts, it has a better once, once a worse camera and can maybe also navigate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And if one still includes the Smartphons and communicators, one has almost one small computers in the bag. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and can photograph no TV. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However the universality of the Handys entails also disadvantages. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The more functions use you on your Handy, the more frequently you will reload it must. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And one of the biggest energy-gluttons is the pass of music. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Only few Handyses can play music longer than ten-twelve hours, mostly it is much fewer. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this sense, Music Player (specifically the simplest) are clearly more efficient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Therefore you should reckon with the cheap Handyses with it that they cannot play music longer than a few hours. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If then you from and at still telephones, you rather buy yourself/themselves another charger for the office to the security - that is valid appliance also for teurere. </seg>
<seg id="28"> With MP3-Playern, you won't have this problem, also the less good endure nonstop business at least 9 hours with a time loading. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Another problem exists then if one wants to cover up the music on the Handy. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately only an inferior part of the appliances owns an USB-Abschluss, furthermore each Handy cannot be connected directly without particular software to a PC. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Of course one can cover up the music on a storage-medium directly, however only few fix-reading-appliances get done without reduction with the tiny storage-cards, that use in Handys, becomes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> With Playern, you require no particular software until on exceptions (iPod). </seg>
<seg id="33"> You/they need to feed the appliance only over USB-Port with music from your PC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Most Handys and Player position even a music-library, arranged after the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or for example the evaluation through users. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some appliances portray only the tree-structure of the Adressverzeichnisses, like like the Windows Explorer, some can both, iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowons, intelligent telephones with operating system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Player are easier to serve, Handyses can more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> With the selection of a concrete appliance, you should especially inquire about the lifespan of the accumulator, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and of course also the Bedienkomfort. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Music is scenery for you above all and hears you she/it every day in the streetcar only shortly for example, an any Handy, that plays MP3-Dateien, is enough then. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What each Handy truly already almost can. </seg>
<seg id="40"> You/they must not also control particularly which music-formats a Handy or a Player can process. </seg>
<seg id="41"> MP3S manage all, and the most music, that you receive, will be exactly in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format hears spread to that the most, and furthermore most appliances can play also music in the WMA-Format. </seg>
<seg id="43"> AAC, a format, that uses Apple and his/its iPods, is less usual. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Better Handyses also make possible the purchase of music online. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One needs the corresponding sides of a Providers or another supplier only over mobile Internet to call, and already one can acquire a song or album. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This service already can at and for itself a beating argument for it why they should get itself a Musikhandy is. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately the offer of the Provider is badly and restricts itself mostly only to fast radio-hits. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The prices are not the lowest either. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Generally however, one assumes it that exactly this type of the sale of music, be it over GSM, Internet or wireless Internet, will master the music-industry in future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Most carry the Handy on itself. </seg>
<seg id="51"> If you have desire to be able to tell by the sound itself/themselves of something, you reach after the Handy into the jacket-bag, during which Player forget, at home lies. </seg>
<seg id="52"> It depends on it however whether you also carry headphones or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung on itself always. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker, that each Handy almost owns, but only the fewest MP3-Players. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The probably biggest advantage of the Musikhandys will lie for many in the price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The cheapest normally cost less than three-thousand crowns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> For three - and four-thousand crowns already receive you a quite decent Walkman. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The biggest Handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are with it. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The best and technically ripest telephones with one 3,5-mm-Öffnung for normal headphones costs up to fifteen-thousand crowns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The advantage of the Player lies in the easy service on the other hand. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The simplest - and not absolutely cheapest, sees selection, - Player can really serve everyone. </seg>
<seg id="61"> A minimum at functions, the similarity with the service with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or for example the record player is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="62"> No collision threatens in form of an erroneously employed mobile Internets and an afterwards horrenden bill for data-transfers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> They should now reach for which appliance </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> Also the cheapest Handyses, for example Vodafone 527, own slot for exchangeable storage-media, type M2, microSD and Ä. one normally. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Even if a corresponding fixes you nachkaufen, two thousand crowns are enough. </seg>
<seg id="66"> However respect. </seg>
<seg id="67"> With the basis-models, normally only cards are supported with a maximum capacity of 2 GBS. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the most expensive can read also 8-GB-Speicherkarten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> If you already possess a Handy and want to buy itself another affordable MP3-Player, then you reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. </seg>
<seg id="70"> According to capacity (maximum 2 GBS) must put you the table then no longer than 1100 crowns on. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Belong to the more selective listeners, you take rather specialized Handys - Walkmans, Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung. </seg>
<seg id="72"> These appliances have autonomous Bedienknöpfe for MP3, and the Bedienkomfort gets him/it of one single MP3-Players so. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Sony Ericsson, his Handys has Walkman the same user-interface from the series, is the widest here like the individually sold MP3-Players. </seg>
<seg id="74"> The same services in the same price-category from up to four-thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GBS) and a long accumulator-lifespan, normally 15 hours, at most up to 35 hours, MP3-Players achieve you the producer mentioned above. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first virtual supplier already gets in this year to the Czech republic. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Maybe </seg>
<seg id="3"> The mobile-radio-market in the Czech republic is quite ripe, the Czech suppliers offer practically all services at, as they are offered also by her/its/their partners in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual supplier, who forces the classic into lower prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Becomes maybe this no longer long on itself lets wait. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> That the Czech mobile-radio-suppliers work to the most expensive in Europe at all, we have already often reported on it on Mobil.cz. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This confirmed incidentally also the telecommunication-authority ?TÚ, that alerted to it, that the price is higher than in the rest of the European union for a SMS here. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the last steps of the European commission in the area regulation of the Roaminggebühren comes it to a paradoxical situation so probably - for some customers of the Czech mobile-radio-suppliers becomes SMSS from the foreign countries cheaper than is at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> How does it come that the prices are so high in the Czech republic in the comparison with Europe? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is simple, the competition, that really does a fight-announcement, is missing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Maybe it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech republic, there are three mobile-radio-networks and a penetration far of more than 100% however. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The mobile-radio-suppliers like to bitch against it about it that there is extremely much competition for the Czech market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Also the chairperson of the council of the Czech telecommunication-authority (?TÚ) often agrees with him/it Pavel Dvo?ák, with that had often expressed in the past, that there is no place for another supplier in the Czech republic. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is probably correct, that a classic supplier with one own network no longer has particularly many chances, incidentally he/it would probably also find frequencies hardly still. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There is another possibility however - a virtual supplier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Exactly the admission of virtual suppliers on the mobile-radio-market brought a clear markdown with itself, on which also the classic mobile-radio-suppliers had to respond then. </seg>
<seg id="17"> There was still with it before the admission of such companies like Tesco mobile or Virgin mobile for the market in Great Britain similar votes like in the Czech republic. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It has turned out however that there is place for such suppliers and that these can be truly successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Incidentally, one needs to look not for examples long. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In February this has reported we over the start of the virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In only a half year, this supplier succeeded in winning more than 100 thousand clients and to rise to the five-biggest supplier of the country so. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Behind Mobilking, the finance-group Penta, that among other things possesses U:fon in the Czech republic, stands with it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The advantage of virtual suppliers exists with it that one can concentrate on a much more concrete target group. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order actually to be able to work, virtual suppliers of namely much few customers need as a classic supplier. </seg>
<seg id="25"> You/they need no relatively high expenses for the construction, the business and the maintenance of a mobile network namely. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the world, the virtual suppliers normally define themselves as Low-Cost-Firmen out so - she/it what is however often accompanied by a less extensive service-offer offers cheap telephone conversations and SMS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> So, Tesco mobile offers in Great Britain SMS about the half cheaper than his/its rivals at least for example. </seg>
<seg id="28"> How the example of Mobilking shows in Poland however, it can be also a quite good move to favor a target group cliche-ful not. </seg>
<seg id="29"> This supplier directs to men namely specifically. </seg>
<seg id="30"> " Real fellows choose Mobilking - the supplier, that pleases them and that can trust her/it/them, according to David Seibert, that CEO of her/it mobile Entertainment Company, the operator-company of this virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="31"> , To say heavily, whether a similar concept like in Poland also in the Czech republic foot could grasp. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Also the press-speaker of Vodafone Miroslav ?epický doubts it: " The Czech market is relatively small for a market-segment, on which most virtual suppliers are based. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Furthermore, he/it is relatively satiated " from the view of the service-offer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In the Czech republic chance-free, the mobile-radio-suppliers think </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> It is however almost sure that, if a virtual mobile-radio-supplier conquers the Czech republic, this not Mobilking will be. </seg>
<seg id="36"> " We admittedly speak of an expansion of this successful project, however in the Czech republic the negotiations don't look especially hopefully. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A market-admission of Mobilking will rather occur " in other countries of our region, says in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz Jana Studni?ková, press-speaker of the finance-group Penta, so. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Indirectly she/it confirmed so that the present mobile-radio-suppliers in the Czech republic have not inclined to this thought particularly. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In the opposite, they try to do everything for it that no potenzieller rival originates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Her/its/their interest in a start of a virtual mobile-radio-supplier shows time the group GTS Novera, that would like to take another step, already for a long time in order to become a real rival of Telefónica O2 Firmenkunden in the area. </seg>
<seg id="41"> " We have a big interest in it, our customer not only party-network - but, to offer also mobile-radio-telecommunication-services. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And the earlier, the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Over this possibility, we have repeated negotiated with all Czech mobile-radio-suppliers. </seg>
<seg id="44"> With some of them, we could already reach " negotiation-advances, according to the press-speaker of the group Pavel Kaidl. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Maybe, better times now come. </seg>
<seg id="46"> From not official information, it follows that the first virtual supplier is to be expected until end of the year maybe. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Up to now however, this of an insurmountable wall of the silence is surrounded. </seg>
<seg id="48"> " In this moment, we don't assume that place consists of the Czech republic for a full virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market shows big Spezifika opposite other markets. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Up to now, no subject has still spoken to " us with a complex and serious project in this area, thinks in his/its explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr?e? from the press-department of Telefónica O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Also further suppliers point out the Spezifik of the Czech market. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The press-speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the explanation of O2: " Up to now, we have still found no viable and on both sides advantageous project, on which they could rely further. </seg>
<seg id="53"> And she/it adds: " In the network of T-Mobile, a virtual supplier will hardly appear until end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="54"> We had already to be available in this moment a concrete offer, being able to think all the for a short time have. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone rather directs his/its attention toward the fulfillment of the requests of the own 3G-Lizenz. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav ?epický thinks to it: " For negotiations with potenziellen virtual suppliers is open we, especially in the area division of expenses and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> We consider exactly this from the view of the customers the best. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The main-strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search after a partner to the construction of a divided network for a fast mobile Internet ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The action of the mobile-radio-suppliers is easy to understand, another supplier was called more competition, this would turn into sinking prices and leads through it also to a decline of the profits. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Why they should therefore help such a rival with the market-admission? </seg>
<seg id="62"> That the suppliers can pull at a rope, if it is about something, also the long covers about the formation of U:fon back and forth. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> The probably strongest pressure in direction ?TÚ went at the moment as U:fon came on the market, from the society T-Mobile from. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Also the publicly accessible information of the ?TÚ-Webseitens covers that. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Now however straight U:fon is suitable as argument why they should not admit a virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Martina Kemrová noticed to it: " The competition-surroundings of the mobile-radio-market was furthermore still strengthened by the market-admission of a fourth mobile-radio-supplier recently. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Under consideration of the character of the mobile-radio-market in the Czech republic is obvious that a new protagonist at the market itself and above all his/its services high requests would put. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> The absolute disinterest of the Czech regulation-authorities astonishes in view of this approach-manner of the mobile-radio-suppliers however. </seg>
<seg id="69"> It is not only the stand of the ?TÚ, that unfortunately in Czech - in the difference to Great Britain and further high developed states - not the area of authority, to intervene in the economic competition, has. </seg>
<seg id="70"> This possesses exclusively the office to the protection of the economic competition (ÚOHS). </seg>
<seg id="71"> This covered his/its quite typical stand to this entire problem however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> " The market-admission of a virtual mobile-radio-supplier would be possible then after a contract-conclusion has occurred between a mobile-radio-supplier and a virtual supplier over the Anmietung of the necessary infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Up to now, no such contract was completed, because the offer potenzieller prospects was not sufficiently interesting " likely for the classic suppliers, so in his/its answer on our inquiry Kristián Chalupa of the department outside-relationships of the ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> Such a formulation would not surprise from representatives of the suppliers. </seg>
<seg id="75"> From an authority, that the consumer-interests represent and among other things should watch on it, that nobody abuses his/its position on the market, this is more than dubious. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Especially, if Kristián Chalupa adds: " In the foreign countries, where virtual suppliers work quite normally, is to be observed that her/its/their market-admission has contributed to a markdown with mobile telephone-services. </seg>
<seg id="77"> Doesn't belong the pressure on the correct working of the market and a markdown to the interests of the ÚOHS probably however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> Almost already stirred unison of the three mobile-radio-suppliers, that results from her/its/their reactions, is truly shocking at this case of that. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question, whether it is truly only about one coincidence, lies on the hand. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Equally like the absolutely same gas-price with the gas stations certainly only coincidence and the consequence of a hard competition is. </seg>
<seg id="81"> " The authority has discovered no indications, that indicate an action directional against the competition, in this matter and consequently she/it has also no reason to intervene on any type in the issue. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No one of the suppliers has a dominante market-position, consequently he/it doesn't also have the corresponding elevated responsibility for his/its action on the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> Probably also the regulation-authority lacks the necessary instruments for an opening of the mobile-radio-market for virtual suppliers for telecommunication ", Chalupa quoted in his/its explanation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many debatable points. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, worked out from the ?TÚ, after the telecommunication from the view of the economic competition one single market is. </seg>
<seg id="86"> On such a market, no one of the Czech mobile-radio-suppliers occupies a dominant position then of course. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Some experts offer another view-manner however - for the market-admission of a virtual supplier is always necessary the consent of the network-operator. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And the mobile-radio-supplier has - logically - for his/its network the monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="89"> The it means that he/it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a certain segment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Even if one doesn't go along with this argument however, it should be a warning for the ÚOHS at least that three mobile-radio-suppliers proceed notably similarly. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Troubles of a row of prospects, including the mentioned society GTS Novera, cover with it that they come with negotiations with all suppliers upon very similar obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="92"> The Abwälzung of the responsibility on the ?TÚ is a quite usual trick, with which the ÚOHS of the whole issue dissociates itself, in the telecommunication-services then. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> This was already to be observed in some similar cases. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately it has not succeeded to push through the expansion of the areas of authority of the ?TÚ into the novella of the telecommunication-law, given a farewell recently, on the area of the economic competition in the telecommunication albeit a row of experts of it had made a slip of the tongue an improvement of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The representatives of the ÚOHS must know that only all too well, however probably they have otherwise-y interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It already goes, if nobody hinschaut </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> Working of any pseudo-more virtual suppliers first remains unheeded, from which it in like the Czech mobile-radio-networks several gives. </seg>
<seg id="98"> It is companies, the proper price list for mobile telecommunication-services, that are however only partly public, spends. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Normally, it is about companies, that act Multilevel-Marketing in the area, namely. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Own mobile telephone-services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others for example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The price lists of these companies reach normally only too select. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The joke of the matter is that the company appears opposite the operator as classic Firmenkunde, that orders a big quantity of SIM-Karten. </seg>
<seg id="103"> As important tidings, he/it gets particular price-offers and other offers then. </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem consists of it that the business-conditions of all Czech mobile-radio-suppliers a like gearteten resale prohibits. </seg>
<seg id="105"> There should be cases, that you describe, it can be then what can lead to a completion of the cooperation with the corresponding society, Martina Kemrová answered our question to this problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> It is however quite unlikely that something similar doesn't around-speak itself with the responsible of the mobile-radio-suppliers. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be about thousands customers. </seg>
<seg id="108"> No operator opposes such an action however. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Doesn't flow them from the activity of these companies to neglecting profits namely, they become simultaneous - in the difference to the actual virtual suppliers - not through the actual official marketing impairs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> Miroslav ?epický alerts to possible problems: " The law makes possible such types of speculations, the services of these companies only of a very low percentage of the customers are used despite all. </seg>
<seg id="111"> These must accept in addition, that the SIM-Karte doesn't run in her/its/their telephone on her/its/their name, they cannot fully own it like the normal customers of the mobile-radio-suppliers " therefore. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Already alone the had to would seem to the ?TÚ at least strangely however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> Furthermore, another question opens itself for the ÚOHS. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Do the mobile-radio-suppliers lock the eyes before such an action, why do they balk against a virtual supplier? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It is to be added, that the ÚOHS to the disclosure of such activities has quite strong areas of authority, and if it doesn't want, it doesn't must itself with the explanation of the suppliers, they would know nothing of it and her/its/their business-conditions would prohibit this, is content. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> When the Czech republic is no longer the most expensive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> Like in the text already several times was emphasized, the market-admission of virtual suppliers entailed a clear price-decline with the different services. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Has practically with it in all countries, where virtual suppliers have originated, tries the classic suppliers, whose to prevent formation practically more or less. </seg>
<seg id="119"> The arguments used by them were practically identically - a too small, as well as too much satiated market, problems with the quality of the services etc </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> Into the sophisticated countries, the regulation-organs reached however exactly in these moments one, that the interests of the mobile-radio-suppliers but that of her/its/their customers tried too true in no way. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Be it through formal measures or not-formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator originated, and this followed further. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately, the Czech regulation-organs throw themselves the whole case like a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Going out from our experiences we cannot dispose that obscurity is in the areas of authority in these cases more than favorable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> However, we don't throw the gun into the grain. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If the background-information are correct and a virtual supplier appears soon, the Czech mobile-radio-market will sit down in movement maybe soon again. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If a supplier admits the formation of a virtual mobile-radio-supplier, the ÚOHS won't remain idle if it goes therefore to refuse further prospects to discriminate. </seg>
<seg id="127"> And the Czechs will finally telephone no longer more expensive than the rest of Europe then. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Since the connection at the Czechoslovakia the Sudeten German - in knowledge of the Czech national-character - has suspected, that they would expect brutality, thoughtlessness, Unverständnis, suppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take on for today and forever the protectorate over the Böhmerwald. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Questions after the accident: Are stewards unlawful in the bus? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The law doesn't know her/it/them, in a long-distance travel-bus, the Umherlaufen is allowed not </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the context with the tragic accident of a bus of the society of student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question poses itself, whether stewards and travelers during the trip in the bus - and herlaufens are allowed to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> We " wanted strictly and keep the law formally, so the activity of a steward stands in the contradiction by the law over the traffic ", according to the speaker of the traffic-ministry Karel Hanzelka. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The accident, with which last week died a twenty-two-year old stewardess, was probably caused by the driver of the truck, who crossed the bus the way. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The young woman sat in this moment to all accident beside the driver, on the least certain place in the car, albeit she/it still had two wide places to the disposal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> A bus can however also have an accident at the moment or keenly can brake in which the steward delivers coffee or newspapers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> A role also plays whether the bus is equiped according to the vehicle-letter also with standing-rooms. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If this is not intended in the bus, the travelers must sit. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The long-distance travel-buses of student Agency have no standing-rooms; something the director of the company, Radim Jan?ura, opposite Aktuáln? .cz confirmed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> We have discussed " this with the ministry, and this has not first agreed to the movement of travelers. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Later one has taken back this, and we have reached a consensus, after which the travelers can go during the trip on the toilet, if they have " her/its/their seat, he/it communicated his/its point of view. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The law knows no steward </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> There is no unambiguous legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legal-rule describes this role. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There is however also no legal-rule, that it prohibits the carrier, to produce services. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The law over the traffic knows only the concept vehicle-companion; his right and duties doesn't define it however, the speaker of the ministry adds Hanzelka unequivocally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The director of the department street-vehicles of the traffic-ministry Josef Pokorný however it thinks that the law covers this problem late. </seg>
<seg id="18"> " It depends on it whether the bus in the product-admission has also standing-rooms. </seg>
<seg id="19"> That is everything " then, he/it emphasizes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Buses subdivide themselves into city-buses where there are standing-rooms and is limited the maximum speed, local traffic-buses with standing-rooms and a higher allowed speed and long-distance travel-buses without standing-rooms with the highest allowable speed and seats that are equiped with safety belts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Like in the airplane, the expert says </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The BESIP-Fachmann for roadworthiness Jaroslav Ho?ín sees no basic problem in the movement of stewards of a bus on board. </seg>
<seg id="23"> " With a liquid Fahrweise, many dangers don't threaten, the situation is comparable with the service of an airplane on board. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Also here is not sure, when turbulences come, and the stewardess can bump " the head. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> If you " brake a bus however keenly, of course also the laws of the physics are valid then. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Equally like in the city-bus or in a streetcar. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The security of the stewards must clarify " the carrier through internal rules, he/it says and also thinks that this problem is not removed completely from the view of the law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Jan?ura is ready to cancel the services </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Student Agency offers as single Busfirma services of stewards. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The company employs approximately two hundred persons in this function. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The director doesn't regard her/its/their occupation also after the accident as risk-pregnant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> " As soon as receives the impression I however, that the occupation of the steward is risk-pregnant, I will cancel him/it. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Coffee and newspapers can get the travelers when getting on. </seg>
<seg id="34"> That would lower " also the expenses, he/it thinks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As interest in the security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in its bus. His/its society drives however only one fraction of lines in the comparison with student Agency. </seg>
<seg id="36"> " We have no stewardesses, we fight against it already from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Earlier or later this finishes with any deadly accident ", he/it had expressed not completely one year ago for Týden.cz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> That was an unbelievable tragedy </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> With the accident of a public bus to Naples, a young stewardess had had an accident from the region of Pilsen, that had worked two years for the society. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The Slovenian TRUCK was turned without probably blinking from the stand-strip and had obstructed the bus the trip. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The driver of the bus tried to avoid through a sharp maneuver, collided with the right front part with the TRUCK however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> That the two places have been sold for the stewards, Jan?ura disputes. </seg>
<seg id="43"> " These places cannot be reserved with long-distance-connections, they are blockaded ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Company wants to sue truckers. </seg>
<seg id="45"> With a compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency won't wait for the judgment, she/it expects a financial damages however also from sides of the guilty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> A law-It-alteration? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Not in view </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> A more exact regulation of the movement of stewards of a bus on board could bring a lawful regulation, on which a thirty-headed expert-team of the traffic-ministry already works over one year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> " This however has still reached to no concrete end. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Buses don't necessarily stand on the agenda, rather the point-system, the maximum speed on the highway also and the application of Handys with the trip ", according to expert Ho?ín. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> " The traffic-ministry doesn't consider the activity of the stewards something, that could essentially endanger the security of the traveler, according to Hanzelka, with which the control of the security of the buses lies in the area of authority the police and the work-protection-authorities. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Düsseldorfer hopes rest on Frankfurt </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Of big words, there is not a lack in the letter of the WestLB-Vorstands at the co-workers of the house. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Through a brings together of units of the Düsseldorfer money-institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, the central capital-market-house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe " could originate, it is called in the become letter known on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The WestLB would bring in one " area of authority-block " with lasting profit-strength into such a business. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And at all such a connection could be the crucial impulse for further Bündelungen in the Landesbankensektor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> So it reads itself if an executive in difficult time wants to demonstrate action-ability. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Because the weakened WestLB takes second place under huge pressure. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only on the part of the EC-commission but also through the Federal-institution for finance-service-supervision, that has made clear the North Rhine-Westphalian government first recently, the time, to find a future-solution, pushes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> From one as always gearteten connection between the Deka-Bank, the savings bank-customers because of her/its/their investment-funds know, and the WestLB is however already since some time the speech - also on Frankfurt side. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas has had admittedly known the Halbjahreszahlen tail of August with the presentation, in an amalgamation of the house at the Mainzer country road with a regional bank, approximately the Helaba or the WestLB, sees no sense he/it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, the administrative council of the Deka, that is ever carried by the regional banks and the savings bank-associations half, has engaged the executive, with which to lead WestLB conversations across common business-activities. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It could walk around the capital-market-business or parts of it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The conversations admittedly have, so it is called at the finance-place, just now begun. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The speech is not from the Deka-Bank, that is with her/its/their 3000 co-workers among the more important employers at the finance-place Frankfurt, for the first time if it is about consolidation in the savings bank-sector. </seg>
<seg id="15"> 2003, it looked a moment long so as the Deka-Bank could amalgamate Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba with the regional bank. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This threesome-association turned into nothing however. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Hardly the plans had become public, the Hessian government voiced disagreement with a participation of the Helaba at it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Also the two other houses didn't find thereupon to each other. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The regional bank Rhineland-Palatinate went Baden-Württemberg at the regional bank in Stuttgart instead. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> However, there have been thought-games over a connection of the Deka-Bank with regional banks again and again. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Finally, Günther Merl, executive-chairperson of the Helaba, had had a heart to heart talk against plan-games over an uniting with his/its house however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Independently from it the realization seems too ripe however that a moving closer of the different houses of the legal sector toots need. </seg>
<seg id="23"> After the state parliament-election is now in Bavaria past, a connection of the BayernLB could sewer-move Baden-Württemberg as first with the regional bank. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For the Helaba, that necessarily is not a good message. </seg>
<seg id="25"> If the pressure should climb to further amalgamations, the partners follow her/it/them for it from. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the south, she/it would be a nurmehr junior-partner, although they stood the finance-crisis until now far better has as the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="27"> One uniting with the west LB on the other hand has put forward Hesse-Thuringia, that is involved with 85 percent at the Helaba, the savings banks - and giro-association beginning of the year a bolt. </seg>
<seg id="28"> She/it would remain if need be North LB. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Such geostrategischen considerations are however only the one side. </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is on the other about the question, fit like the different business-models of the individual houses to each other. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In June, Merl, the crucial question, expressed the future-ability of the regional banks should be guaranteed with which business-model, it has not been answered by the German savings banks - and giro-association until now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> In the end, also a Zerlegung could stand the west LB, that is not wished there naturally however. </seg>
<seg id="33"> So the speech is also in the letter of the local executive dated it then, it is striven for a " total-solution " for the house in any case. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Like that with the unites of individual units with the Deka-Bank under a hat has brought, will still appear. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The German Bankensystem is relatively stable, emphasized Federal-finance-ministers peer Steinbrück only in the violated week. </seg>
<seg id="3"> How good, that the politician would use the word " relatively " and as well einflocht, that the German Bankensektor of the crisis-like developments is not spared. </seg>

<seg id="5"> That in the Dax actually wrote down to Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo Estate (HRE) gets a billion-credit from a consortium of German banks in order to shield itself/themselves from the turbulences at the markets. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday, the credit-helps amounted on up to 35 billions Euro. </seg>
<seg id="7"> That hypo actually Estate must pay interest on only the part, that she/it takes also in claim. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The money comes as well as from private like also legal banks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Losses are background with the daughter Depfa. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Staatsfinanzierer had refinanced itself according to a newspaper-report for long-period-projects, for which he/it has lent money, - because of what of the mistrust at the markets meanwhile no longer possible is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the first half-year 2008 was the Barreserve of the bank about 95 percent on 2,37 millions Euro shrunk, also the personal capital-quota had given in easily from 1,6 on 1,45 percent. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The current profits and the net-profits from finance-businesses had fallen opposite the Vorjahreszeitraum on zero, the profits from attributions to demands and certain investments as well as from the dissolution of reserves in the credit-business about more than 70 percent on 5 millions Euro sunk. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Only thanks to higher profits from reimbursements of nachgelagerten settlement-expenses from the restructuring of the former Depfa-Gruppe as well as from the reimbursement of interests after the depositing-order and from the business-purchase for concern-businesses, the profit-deficit had let are still cancelled moderately with approximately 16 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> That formerly Staatsfinanzierer first had itself after his/its denationalization in the year 1990 with industrial real estate-credits verspekuliert, that had been separated in the Aareal bank then. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Because one in the classic state-funding too little deserved, the Depfa had increased engaged in infrastructure-projects and the funding of community-projects of private investors and the state then, Private-Public-Partnership (PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. </seg>

<seg id="18"> Already for 2007, she/it had been shortened about two third. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> That hypo actually Estate is since the Depfa-Übernahme an important state - and Infrastrukturfinanzierer. </seg>
<seg id="20"> She/it is dependent stronger than other institutes on the refinancing at the Interbankenmarkt since she/it has no tidings-no-situations. </seg>
<seg id="21"> With the breakdown of the American investment-bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago it has dried up the credit-award under the banks again largely since the banks hoard her/its/their liquidity. </seg>
<seg id="22"> That hypo actually Estate needs annually for a part - approximately 50 billions Euro - the Kreditportfolios of the Depfa short-term methods to the refinancing. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="23"> After communication that hypo actually Estate, the funding-demand of the group is met with the credit on foreseeable time and shielded the business " of the influence the international money-mart " largely inable to function at present. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> That stands to hope for stockholders and creditors of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But in view of the dynamics and imponderabilities of the crisis, there is probably no certainty. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It even is not unthinkable that the funding must not be taken in full scope in claim. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But also the opposite is not to ausschleißen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> After the bank still stood on the late Sunday evening according to hearing in front of the insolvency, also the at least temporary rescue is not able to calm down the natures. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The share price breaks about 75 percent on 3,30 Euro one. </seg>

<seg id="34"> The priority debts hardly last themselves moved shows, the courses of the Nachrang-Anleihen more clearly give in. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Above all the bonds of the former subsidiary are concerned Württemberg hypo and understandably the over 2009 outgoing terms. </seg>

<seg id="6"> I was excited. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Already before the school-way, I had jitters. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I live at the edge of Tokyo in direction Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the Tachibana Highschool. </seg>

<seg id="21"> The girl beside me has grinned rather broadly, she/it found it a honor that the exchange-schoolgirl should sit beside her/it/them. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The rest of the hour was rather quiet, sounded however as the gong, I was stormed downright. </seg>
<seg id="23"> All spoke in confusion and giggled and asked me holes into the stomach - with it is it really heavy to understand Japanese English. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> All her/its/their Bentos unpacked in the pause then. </seg>
<seg id="25"> My guest-mother had made also such a Lunchbox for me - that is something else than the desolate German trace-breads once. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a type meat in the Tofumantel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Usually I have no pale glimmer what exactly I eat here in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The things look strangly and taste good completely new. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Solidly it stands that everything is really more delicious. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Naja, until on the salty inlaid plums maybe, brrrr! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Bentoses are simply lunches at Japanese schools not only. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It sometimes occurs that a girl gives a boy an even prepared Bento, that she/it dresses especially skillfully then, - in the hope, to know the boy with the Pausensnack near, to learn. </seg>
<seg id="33"> I have read from it in my Manga-Comics. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> ' Why then especially Japan? ', have my friends asked me as I told them that I want to go for one year in Tokyo to the school. </seg>
<seg id="36"> I have always said then: </seg>
<seg id="37"> " Because it simply fascinates " me. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Finally, I read Mangas already for years the most dearly. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> It was therefore completely clear for me that I had to travel here someday. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Because I have also a weakness for tradition, manners and customs. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And one puts big value on them/her/it here. </seg>
<seg id="43"> On the one hand, Japan is a country of the newest technologies and trends - on the other side is strict it, disciplines and traditional. </seg>
<seg id="44"> And because all so well is organized, I have not lost felt here as well even if Tokyo is the biggest city, that I have ever seen. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Also rats have feelings </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A rat or a scrapes flees with danger, that is called that she/it feels also fear? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The neuro-scientist Joseph LeDoux is confident: Also many animals have feelings. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Only like could check one whether they feel the same, if she/it itself like like we holds back? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Internetzeitschrift " Edge " becomes since publishes several years of contributions of famous scientists. </seg>
<seg id="6"> MIRROR presented selected answers in a series on the question " something ONLINE, you consider true without being able to prove it? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> I believe that animals have sensations and other Bewusstseinszustände without I or someone could prove this until now otherwise where we can prove not once that other people have consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But we can hope in this case at least since all human brains show the same reason-configuration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> As soon as we turn however other species to us and questions of the feels or quite broadly the consciousness broaches, we enter rough terrain because the hardware doesn't agree. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> If a rat gets in danger, she/it toots the same as many other animals: She/it places herself/itself dead, escapes or attacks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> People behave similarly. </seg>
<seg id="12"> I don't believe in it however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Two aspects the brain-structure make it difficult, our subjective experiencing on that of animals too figurative. </seg>
<seg id="14"> To the one, that almost always lock up with the human consciousness associated circuitries the lateral präfrontalen Cortex, because of his/its participation at the short-time-memory and at the Ausführungs - / control-functions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This wide region is much higher than with the remaining primates developed with the human being and seems fully to be missing with other creatures. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At least with those aspects of our consciousness, that depend on the präfrontalen Cortex, under it the knowledge, whoever are we, and the ability too flat and, to adjudicate, reason therefore exists to the assumption that the human being even differs from the other primates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Another dramatic peculiarity should lie in the linguistic nature of the human being: Since a so big part is interconnected his experience with language, it is called often, the consciousness depends on it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this case, they could exclude animals. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However even if consciousness would not depend on language, this would influence it certain, sodass itself animal consciousness, probably very much from most of our Bewusstseins-zustände how it may also be obtained, would distinguish. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Therefore it is heavy to determine as consciousness may look with other animals. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If it itself, as something internal and subjective, neither measures still, because of the particular hardware, on the basis of our own experience has analyzed, so his/its exploration places us in front of big problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Most of my implementations refer to the content of the conscious sees, however there is still another aspect of the consciousness beside it, the scientifically more simply accessible should be. </seg>
<seg id="23"> They could examine the Bewusstseinsprozesse of animals regardless of her/its/their contents, and exactly that happens with studies over the short-time-memory of primates, especially at the example of the Visualisierung. </seg>
<seg id="24"> However with this base, that Christof cook and Francis Crick pursued, one resorts rather on the neuralen correlate of the consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: Both may be identically or also not. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This base emphasizes interesting-proof also the meaning of the präfrontalen Cortex for the realization of the Visualisierung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> What now emerges for the sensations? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I attribute her/it/them to it that an emotional system is activated like the brain agreed the fear in one of his/its own activity. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For what we call fear ", the mentale condition, in which we are, is therefore if the activity the in the brain of localized defense-system or their consequences (like physical reactions) RAM covers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> So about sensations are taken a narrow view bound at the regions of the Cortex, the primates and especially the individual mark. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Connected emerged fine gradations of the feels with the linguistic nature, because we differentiate with help the words and the grammar conditions and can categorize in order to attribute her/it/them also to others beside us. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In contrast Antonio Damasio thinks for example that sensations follow from more primitive activities in the body-feeling-regions of the Cortex and the brain-trunk Jaak Pankseep, that concentrates on the brain-trunk however more, similarly. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Since this network has not changed in the sprint of the human evolution very much, it could absolutely be involved sensations at gattungsübergreifenden. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Purely theoretically I cannot disagree with him/it, it considers unverifiable however. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Pankseep argues, what appears with rats and people like fear, feels probably also in both cases so: How however could one check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly? </seg>
<seg id="35"> One scrape flees with danger whether also she/it feels fear? </seg>
<seg id="36"> In my eyes, bare behavior-similarity can still prove no experience-equality. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Admittedly, the neurale comparison helps: Rats and people have similar brain-trunks, scraping against it not even one brain. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But the brain-trunk is responsible for sensations? </seg>
<seg id="39"> And even if they could prove that for the human being: How wanted they to prove it with rats? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> I believe that rats and other mammals, maybe even scrape, who knows, sensations have. </seg>
<seg id="41"> But I would not know as I should prove that. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And because presumably fundamentally itself her/its/their sensations from that our it distinguishes since the human consciousness is founded on particular circuits and on language, I rather explore the emotional behavior as the emotional sensations of rats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Anyway advances wave here on the neuralen level provided one measures the same with rats and people. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As I don't explore language and consciousness with rats, so also not sensations, I don't know however whether they exist. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One may consider that short-sighted, but I come rather in front than to run continuous against a wall. </seg>
<seg id="46"> I am just a practical Emotionalist. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Debate about bilingual education: Formation in English-language surroundings </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In this edition of the " Education Watch ", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates to the bilingual education. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific co-worker in Kalifonischen studies and leading director in the school educational-sciences at the Pacific Research institute for Public Policy, a co-author of the book " is not as good as one thinks: Why the method-class needs " a varsity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> A complicated task is to be gone down well with the hispanischen voters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Barrack Obamas suggestions to the topic formation are a typical example for it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Obamas election-campaign mentions, that " the likelihood to complete the school with afro-amerikanischen and hispanischen students successfully, lower is, as with white students " - what is correct. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In order to close this performance-distance, Obamas educational-plan specifically recommends under others a bilingual transition-phase in the education for the ones, that learn English first. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Nevertheless the question consists at Obama of it whether his/its use for the bilingual education, that puts the main focus on instruction in other languages as English, disagrees with his/its interest to reduce the distance in the school-performances. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Let's take Sixth Street Prep ", a primary school in the eastern Los Angeles, as example ". </seg>
<seg id="10"> Hispanisches are the majority of the students and come from families with low income. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Learns English more than a third of the students, from which many are only since short in the country. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Nevertheless, students of the fourth class have insisted the state-examination into 2008 astonishing 100 percent in Mathe on a good level. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Also surprising became 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year in the English-examination as well assesses. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This astonishing success was reached with other methods, as the ones, that are preferred by Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The school of Sixth Street puts her/its/their main focus on checkup and practice, on steady control of the knowledge and a stand, that tolerate no exceptions. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The school practices the base, after which the education proceeds in an English-language surroundings, the further. Exactly that is the point, that Obama should heed, the headmistress Linda Mikels so. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This base attaches value to the almost exclusive application of the English language in the compartment-instruction. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Woman Mikels, who refuses the idea of bilingual education, said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a student, who had come before it from Mexico first shortly. 12 months later they would enter the class-area and can recognize him/it no longer. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Worked ", she/it remarked, " it works for us ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Would Obama take a school like the " Sixth Street Prep " as model for other schools with big share in Latin American and other English learning students? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The performances of the school would do the answer on this question easy, however the educational-political positions within his/its own party, the national Bildunsgvereinigungens support the idea of bilingual education for a long time, and forecasts do his/its own consistent support of the bilingual education over Obamas answer doubtfully. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> While he/it agrees to the point, that Immigrant Englisch should learn, he/it has trivialized the topic recently in that he/it remarked that people should stop, have worries about the legislation aiming on " only English ". </seg>
<seg id="23"> Stattdessen, he/it said: It should guarantee " her/it/them that your child Spanish can ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If Obama wants actually to close the performance-distance, he/it should take educational-models, who work, instead of despising her/it/them into account carefully and, to trivialize. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The pride and the strains in the life of the black population, in a city of the quite particular type, </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hide between the protuberances of the leisure time-parks in the vicinity of Orlando, few miles of the glittering, is and gigantic drift removes, a quiet city, in which the pride and the complications of the Afro-amerikanischen culture come to the light, lies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Eatonville, that first fully black city in the country and the home town Zora Neale Hurstons, it is to be described no longer as simply as Hurston in 1935 did: " the city with 5 seas, three Krocketplätzens, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison ". </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nowadays, it is a pilgrim-place. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Alice Walker, Toni Morrisons and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Lost festival in Eatonville the most famous author of that Harlem renaissance to remember. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And is nevertheless and remains the city, that she/it describes? and that she/it to a Touristenausflugsziel it did in that she/it accepted her/it/them into him/it Florida guides, that were produced to the times of the depression of the Federal-author-project? in much sense a place of the quite particular kind. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Eatonville is so independent, solid and private like in the 1930ern, as Hurston wrote, that rural black communities in Florida often refused to divide her/its/their true thoughts with the white man, that " so little knows about us, that he/it doesn't know something him/it escapes ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Even nowadays, in one year in him/it a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, to an open conversation over race-circumstances calls, it is still sorry many here to be observed by outsiders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> " We are been told 59, from birth at an inhabitant of the city and parishioner of the oldest church of the city, roofed on it like our history, according to Hortense Jones, very much. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It must be correct ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Eatonville will define long time as paradox of the triumph and the fight. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is both a historic example of the black movement as well as a community of almost 2.400 inhabitants in which the poverty-quota is double so high as the Landesdurchschnitt. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example of that on the one hand - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, that has her/its/their roots in the American slavery. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is not surprising that inhabitants here as well as is with pride also as on the hat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And so right the misgivings actually began about Eatonville's image with Zora as all Hurstons name here. </seg>
<seg id="16"> She/it introduced her/its/their home town to the world in books, that came from hearts and were written in dialect, just like " Mules and Men " (1953) and " Their Eyes were watching God " (1973) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Five paragraphs in the Florida-guide changed the city, that quite close to the route 77 lies, a street that through the often-forgotten center of Florida leads, to the arenas of black history and human drama. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Impudently like Oskar as well as in the real life also as in the literature, Hurston Leser led first mayor, Joe Clarke, to the store of Eatonvilles and turned to more private issues then. </seg>
<seg id="19"> " Away from the street to the lefts ", she/it wrote, that is " brown -weiss painted modern school, with her/its/their groomed gardens and playgrounds, of which Howard Miller always takes care, although hardly reads he/it and can write. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> She/it mentioned also the new man of widow Dash and wrote that lee sells Glenn " beverages of each type and goes " was-auch-immer with hour-rooms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In only few hundred words therefore brought Hurston Eatonville with self-government in connection, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This was no guide quite certainly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, this was not a portrait, that was estimated by all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> " Zora described the things so, as they, according to the 90-year old Ella Dinkins, were " the Hurston one of the Johnson-Mädchen perpetuated in that she/it quoted the men, the songs over them/her/it her/its/their beauty sang that was more fully sexual insinuations. </seg>
<seg id="25"> She/it added: " Some people didn't like this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> One still remembers here Hurtson as an active eccentric, who came back regularly, after her/its/their family was drawn after Jacksonville, Florida. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that if raged Hurston into the city came, she/it this usually without warning did, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and with pants dresses, in a city that even today itself something on her/its/their venerable clothing-style imagines. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Most inhabitants were fascinated loudly Mr. Franklin whereas much despised her/it/them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> " The people were Zoras always to see " gladly, Mr Franklin said. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But " she/it remained never too long ", he/it added during he/it in his/its chair teetered, on a terrace situated to the back, that looks at the Sabelia lake, in which was baptized according to Hurston of all likelihood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As Hurston in 1960 died she/it was poor and her/its/their books assaulted. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Together with the bulk of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her/it/them. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although she/it was a famous author once, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard college in the 1920ern, she/it became Pierce, Florida, in fort where she/it lived, in an anonymous grave buried. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In Eatonville, there was no big commemoration, no public readings in the big style. </seg>
<seg id="35"> " I don't think that she/it her/its/their contribution in the world or her/its/their heritage in the least, according to Valerie Boyd, has understood author of " Wrapped in Rainbows ", a biography over Hurston the 2003 was published. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The change came in the 80er years. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Orange county authorities wanted to put a five-track-y highway through the city in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard the slow two-lane main street of the community. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Orlandos suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 through the western outskirts. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The suggestion was presented as Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his/its history. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Compulsory-integration, among other things, an end had put down the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In the 50er years, the fight brought Hass into the community against race-mixture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Often came " in this time a pile of white boys and she/it oranges and stuff threw on them/her/it away from sedentary people ", Mr. Franklin said. </seg>
<seg id="43"> There was a woman was killed that with it even once. </seg>
<seg id="44"> You/they threw a watermelon out of the car ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> In 1955 questioned Hurstons in a letter at the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the colonel of court of justice, to force integration, in that respects " her/it/them his decision in the case Brown against the inspector as " abusive instead of my race, marked. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Inhabitants say nowadays that although the annulment of the racial segregation was positive in some sense, she/it that the group-cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of his/its teenager weakened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> " Black children were it accustomed to be embraced - I reminds me at it - one they embraced his/its teacher in the morning and embraced his/its teacher in the evening ", according to N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and business-leading director of the nonprofit group to the protection of the Eatonville community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> That could be gotten up for a very long time, she/it added until teachers and students came from the same place no longer. </seg>
<seg id="49"> " They didn't embrace his/its white teacher, because he/it was a white teacher - I my there is existing " a cultural gap, woman Nathiri said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> However the franchises have contributed to it that room was made for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists, who disregarded prejudices, just like she/it it did, with positive self-confidence and statements like: " As anybody can refuse itself the joy of my society! </seg>
<seg id="51"> I don't understand it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In the year 1975, the author Alice Walker got going to Hurstons nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her/its/their fame. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Five years later was a much praised Hurston-Biographie of Robert E. to find Hemenway in the bookshelves, and made her/it/them renewed to a part of the American literature-canon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> The highway-project came exactly to a time, in which Eatonvilles stood most famous daughter in the light of the public once again. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And Hurstonses saw this time old neighbors she/it as savior. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> The community began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival in order to show something the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Thousands of fans came to the Eröffnungsevent two years later, and every January, many come back for the celebration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> Some years later, the district of his/its street-building plans turned away. </seg>
<seg id="59"> " The plans of a five-track-y highway enlivened the city, the totals accelerated with top-speed, awakened real citizen-pride ", woman Nathiri said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Woman Boyd somewhat more simply expressed it: " Zora rescued Eatonville ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> The victory against the highway-project has contributed to a change of the self-picture of the city. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Newcomers came more and more, just like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer, that goes since 1993 here into the church, and natives began to estimate the past again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Eatonville was accepted 1998 into the nationwide historic register. </seg>
<seg id="64"> A new one-story library, named of course after Hurston, opened in 2006 on the neugepflasterten and beautified Kennedy Boulevard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> Nowadays, Eatonville is still a peculiarity in Florida: she/it sometimes can only 6 miles of the downtown of Orlandos itself feels like a behind-alley in summer-moving, as small as at that time as she/it from only 27 black families in the 1880ern was established. </seg>
<seg id="66"> , She/it is black to 90% nowadays, </seg>
<seg id="67"> Outsider on the search after the history Eatonvilles and his/its meaning is often treated with caution still. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> For most interviews, an authorization is necessarily in the advance and certain things - just like the wall-painting of Eatonvilles eldest church, that was painted whitening by one and represents black men with the field work, - cannot be photographed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, assertive teacher with a preference for Dunkelrot, still fears, that her/its/their shielded community is misunderstood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> And nevertheless, at the same time to her/it the Hurston-Festival bigger became, also an elevated degree was born at home-pride. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Above all young people are inclined to it to see Eatonville so like Hurston her/its/their entire race saw: very beautifully, with all his/its problems, neither bad even better and just as proud, creative and hard-working, foolishly and durchmischt like each other races - and Völkergruppe in America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> It can hear the sincere love to this city that one in the voice from Mr. Franklins Neffen, the 18-year old Edwin Harvey, that intends to come back after the college after Eatonville in order to work in the administration or with the police, that could use some help according to him/it. </seg>

<seg id="7"> In his/its project `Flamenco-people ' represents builders' abwechselungsreiche theatrics of some productions the German photographer Günter on the stage with singers, dancer and guitarists. From this side, he/it was even little known for the artists. </seg>
<seg id="8"> With this suggestion, the photographer manages a special Ikonografie of the flamenco-representation on different levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The showing, that belongs to the program of the month of the photography of the flamenco, `spiegelt the international importance of flamenco, that becomes ever bigger from the day to day, wider', the artist explains and clearly does that `Flamenco-people ' `jeder any human being can be, but if one looks at the photos, so the observer notices that it is no typical pictures of artist on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Quite normal people on the portraits are artists, who are in the situation, passion, sorrow, joy to mediate on the stage and to move the public with it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In order to be able to hold on the personality of these artists, one must do no photos on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Her/its/their personality and her/its/their character is in her/its/their hearts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> What interested me to manage a personal atmosphere, that would enable me, was the characters of the biggest flamenco-masters festzuhalten' with the photo-camera. </seg>

<seg id="17"> That is not only the dance, the chant or the instrumental-game at itself but the personality of the artist, his/its character, that tempts the public with his/its art. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The search after the essential, after a certain something, which in form of the harks, the being visible becomes, is and was the solid goal of this work, that in the near future in the gallery of that El Fotómata is presented. </seg>

<seg id="23"> I think that the portrait is the most difficult type in the area of the photography. </seg>
<seg id="24"> You meet or run into persons, personalities, whom you don't know sometimes at all, or they leave you alone for one pair of minutes in order to be able to do a photo. </seg>

He/it has this to owe Esperanza Aguirre, that engaged him/it before three years of the autonomous community Madrid, a memorial-film to the second century-celebration at the 2. , To turn November in Madrid. Above all, because the history is based on the basis of `Episodios Nacionales', that assumed the job. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The total-contribution of 15 millions, that was put by the autonomous community Madrid for trick-works, offers Garci as he/it inflicted, that `einmalige Möglichkeit' with help of decorations and corresponding clothings the picture from the `verwirrten Spain, which picked out the wrong leader for the fight, because brought the people had become darzustellen' through the fight for the independence and under the reign of the Ferdinands of the VII in remains. </seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the cineast regrets that one with the funding like with `Alatriste ' or `Los fantasmas de Goya', twice so high as with `Sangre de mayo', could not calculate, therefore some scenes could not be turned from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci almost worked together his/its whole career. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For this reason, Garci, that was also film-director in `Volver at empezar', has participated through his/its usual operation: he/it placed himself/itself on the stage in regard to the actors, with whom one must first rehearse, before one starts to turn and he/it appeared to `demütigend for the ones, that had done no Casting, ' and respect procures, `ein part of the occupation of the film-director consists to achieve help in the theater and in the cinema in order to know what of the cinema-industry, in which one works, happens. ' </seg>
<seg id="9"> Many actors, into whom he/it runs in `Sangre de mayo', must repeat before his/its camera, like in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Garci, Oscar-candidate in four nominations, from which he/it has won one, is of the opinion and assured that no one of the three candidates, that defends in this year of Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood, represents a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de Bill-ary francés' and also finally not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For this film, Garci expects no awards. </seg>
<seg id="12"> You believe `Am start, that you work for the posterity, later you notice, that it is only for thriving, and now you are content, if one produces another film hat', Garci explains employment after more than 30 years. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The USA can introduce themselves without Paul Newman badly </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> `Manchmal manages God perfect personalities. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Paul Newman was one of it. ' </seg>
<seg id="4"> This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, that with him/it in `Sensationsreporterin ' worked together, and from the at that time ruling idea of the US-American cinema which became calm in the sting, from whole America until Newman with his/its exciting idea came and her followed. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Look simply what it cost her/it/them him/it to lend the Oscar. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And as he/it retreated 2007. </seg>
<seg id="7"> And he/it knew that he/it was very sick. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Nevertheless, that was for finished a big hit. </seg>
<seg id="9"> `Was one sometimes feels, is essentially more than an expression, and now I have a big friend verloren', Robert Redford said crying, `mein lives and my country were the biggest oddness of his/its life. ' </seg>
<seg id="10"> No one had neither to make fear for itself ridiculously still to exaggerate. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As `Vater ' the cinema and the fatherland has died he/it in a sad moment, in which fear prevails before terrorists and before the market-breakdown, in which the dejected self-esteem of the US-Americans is on the hopeless search after reasons in order to get back dignity. </seg>
<seg id="12"> If only few people, that one can admire, remain in this hard time without virtue, so one must not necessarily be Luis Cernuda, about Paul Newman too dear. </seg>
<seg id="13"> For all, he/it embodied a platonic ideal of the beauty and the truth quasi. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He/it was official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered like different losses as well as also profits: from the foundation, that has prescribed itself to the fight against the drugs and was established in honor of his/its son from the first marriage, that died of overdose, until to the own brand of house-done and organic products. </seg>
<seg id="15"> That of everything is a gift for the country, in which it cost him/it much effort, to become generally accepted against a deadly nutritional-culture. </seg>
<seg id="16"> A wide wave of the amazement beats to take towering over Hollywood regardless of nationalities and citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that is dead not only one human being but the whole era. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Englishman Sam Mendes, film-director and Oscar-prizewinners, said, that the work with Newman was less than the top of his/its career no longer or not. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Russell Crowe, the evil boy, who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his/its biggest inspiration. </seg>
<seg id="20"> `Uns has all verlassen' the biggest of us, George Clooney, maybe one of few, who dares today, confirmed to live tries like Paul Newman lived: high requests at the righteousness get, a responsible private life, far from which cameras remove, leads. </seg>
<seg id="21"> That possibly is not in the present-day media-jungle simply or not once always. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But there is somebody, that tries it, and Paul Newman was an example for it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He/it had a time parted and was fifty years married after it to Joanne Woodward, that was loyal he/it, although there were surely many possibilities not to be it. </seg>
<seg id="24"> `Wozu should eat a Hamburg I on the street if I have fillet at home? ', did he/it often joke even. </seg>

<seg id="1"> For the Olympic games, the streets are defective in Madrid. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, the dream of many of us is to be organized some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it can be 2016 however maybe. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But I wonder: `Sind we for it prepares? ' </seg>
<seg id="4"> Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not correct! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> She/it was called perfect street, and according to my judgment, she/it was the worst street with all, that there was, therefore and at it. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Nonsense is natural the one bulk, if they heeded the evaluation and I could test it, something similar would not have come through unequivocally. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But, we go through everything from the beginning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The nonsense starts with the Ticketholen, that licenses you to go as first. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It seems to me not to be bad either, but if they let you already proceed, they should give you also everything, including chip, in order to avoid the jams on the street. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore however not. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Here, they leave you get only the ticket, that first nonsense, that consists of it, only therefore to go there, and, after an infinite line, the surprise is there! There was the T-shirt only in the size `S ', a second nonsense, because I need the size XL, </seg>
<seg id="12"> Where do we actually live then? </seg>
<seg id="13"> Oder is it so that was adjudicated after the crisis to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less material? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Therefore good, matters like these are a small thing in the comparison to the days on the street. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Apart from it, that one must go very early in order to get the chip, a line of at least 15 minutes is already there and, furthermore, one must let the backpack lie. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The attendant has lasted more than 35 minutes, what in the case of a street, where 11 000 people are expected, is incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Finally, as also expecting it was, the street started and we had not let our return-sacks lie before it, even if it was successful once, but getting back her/it/them would already be more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Furthermore, it saw, in these 40 minutes wait after rain from, sodass it to the temptation, to organize a people-rebellion and to attack the little house, came. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I believe, mornings will have some 500 people pneumonia surely and some like I will appear because of this chip, that I have received, with the Klassifikation not once in time, I can already think that the exit was stamped incorrectly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Of course, if they asked me about a perfect street, I would never think of this street. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So I believe, we will still dream of a city, that is well prepared for the Olympic games, long </seg>

<seg id="1"> Microsoft on the search after a virtual Rezeptionistin </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On the `Emerging Technology Conference', organizes from WITH, Microsoft has introduced the advance of the new picture-recognition-system and the human being-interaction, a nature of the artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is however capable, to take care of some primitive tasks, like for example a taxi orders or in the case of Microsoft, that is a route-planner in order to move on the campus of the business. The system heeds that, which it hears during the conversation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Thanks to a camera and a form - and face-recognition-system, this `Rezeptionistin can ' how many persons are in the area recognizes, whoever are she/it and remember, as they were dressed, it can listen and the key-words of her/its/their conversation understand. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It can classify also the present after the conversations into the groups. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the presentation-video, `die Rezeptionistin' notices a third person, but she/it understands that this person is not affiliated to the group, that leads with her/its/their conversation, and that also no Firmenangestellter is. </seg>
<seg id="6"> She/it asks whether the person wants to visit somebody here and answers that she/it will listen soon. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Everything without the blue Screenshot </seg>
<seg id="8"> Impressive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> That is the future surely. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Now, the business has better matters, on which it can concentrate, on the next version of her/its/their operating system Windows for example. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They talked this week about the strategy-change of Microsoft very shallowly. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Windows 7 will be faster and won't have so many tied in programs. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Steve Ballmer determined that if the computers with the most necessary equiped, instead of to fill her/it/them with the commercial garbage, become work she/it so. Human being, Steven, that will be only for the few. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Everything is only one observation if one considers that Microsoft in Windows versions one or other function and `Extras ' inflicted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The directional-change is worthwhile </seg>
<seg id="16"> That Microsoft has right, the operating system loses meaning, exactly like the software, gradually. </seg>
<seg id="17"> As Google chrome appeared in the network, that was a part of the theory that it is the first step of Google in order to compete with Windows. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Skillfully many pointed out that the Browser is no operating system. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The operating system, as an indisputable part, will always be necessary, so that hardware and software can work simultaneously. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The operating system fills the function, that can be compared with the function of his/its wife or his/its husband, if it goes therefore to inform his/its mother-in-law of something. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> That is correct. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The system will never vanish, but one must at his/its `Tod ', not as an absolute but as relative truth, thinks. </seg>
<seg id="23"> What Ballmer said this week, the confirmation of this idea is. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The people give each time of less attention to the operating system, for it more the Web-Browser. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The computer is only started, about which Firefox, that to execute Explorer or chrome and every day, we spend more time at surfing, as in the surroundings of the `Fenster '. </seg>
<seg id="26"> For what does the half serve in the computer of existing applications? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Fewer is more </seg>
<seg id="28"> And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista. </seg>
<seg id="29"> More easily, not so exaggerated, less complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The interest of Microsoft is more to integrate his/its on-line-services, that the alternative can finally turn into Google then. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the reality, they need that, without doubts. I bring a small example for it. </seg>
<seg id="32"> I have the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recuperation-areas for Microsoft Angestellte at the beginning of the month done. </seg>
<seg id="33"> On him/it refreshment-beverage-vending machine is fortified a sign: `Deine search. Our Zukunft'. It prints out a request to use own tool for on-line-search. </seg>
<seg id="34"> In the year 2006, an independent study came to the end that the 66% of the employee with Microsoft, Google for the investigations in the network used. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Incidentally, last week was also confirmed that the new version of the Windows has turned out for mobile 7 in the retardation. </seg>
<seg id="36"> She/it doesn't become start but end of 2009 appears, sooner even 2010. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Microsoft looks for the possibility to bring 7 and Windows to Windows mobile 7 on the mark simultaneously. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Every day, the telephone changes in a computer. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other postponement will cost money. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Some children speak at night </seg>
<seg id="3"> I my not the ones, that wake up and tell us something, which has happened on the day before it, with it, but the children, who speak during the sleep. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you will be terrified, but in the reality, that has no meaning. </seg>
<seg id="5"> That is a positive insomnia, that is named speaking in the sleep. </seg>
<seg id="6"> She/it is rather dispersed, above all with the children and teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Surely, was told by you more than one, that you have spoken at night. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This phenomenon can appear occasionally, a time in the life, for example, as while the up temperature, or regular, every day, a time per week, a time in the month, on the next day, the child can remember at nothing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> There is no single reason, that causes this appearance. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Often, for contexts are looked with other appearances in the sleep, like nightmares, panic-stricken fear at night, Enuresis noctura, bedwetting at night, speaking in the sleep sought, but there is no reason for it. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As we have mentioned it already earlier, fiber, Stresssituationen or overstrain can care about very high. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In any case, that is a little explored phenomenon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The frequency, with which it appears, is very variable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It can be, that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers or it can an opposite completely his/its, screams, wines, long discussions. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In the cases, if the remark is very intensive, is recommended to observe the child and to let discuss itself with a specialist in order to check whether a problem, which fear causes and comes this way about, is available. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> We have said, that it is a positive disturbance, therefore it is not treated, be it, she/it is connected with another insomnia, that can be treated, for example, with which Schlaf-Apnoe or with the Stress. </seg>
<seg id="17"> What one can do is, a string of simple prevention-measures enforces: </seg>
<seg id="18"> Attempts, to excite the child before not sleeping. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Therefore, stressful television-programs pick out quiet game for the child and avoid, that awfully and something too wild is. </seg>
<seg id="20"> With the nervous children, whom relaxations are recommended, relaxation-methods can be applied in order to help them to receive a certain inner silence. </seg>
<seg id="21"> That helps the child to sleep quietly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> If speaking occurs in the sleep once, tries to protect the silence. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Think of it that it is harmless for the child and will be able to remind it itself on the next day at nothing, which has happened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Useful advices </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Don't wake it. </seg>
<seg id="26"> That is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will wake up it rudely. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Although the child speaks, it sleeps, therefore it rests. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Think of it, if it turns out verängstigt after one pair of appearances, so it is recommended, which reason the child has for the fear discusses to leave or to find out. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If they understand, what it says, what is not so usual, the child doesn't put down under pressure in order to enforce an interrogation and, to work out more piece of information. </seg>
<seg id="30"> You will be able to so reach nothing with it, because if the child sleeps, it is unconsciously and cannot think about it. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Furthermore, you will hear, what it says, but you won't know, what it dreams and why it says that, therefore they are ends, that you pull out of it, with the interpretation of the piece of information and him/it carefully. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that hears her/it/them that at night and knows his/its secrets. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Not once as joke. </seg>
<seg id="34"> That causes much fear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Therefore, makes you no worries, it is nothing bad, that is a moment, that lasts only few minutes. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Discussion - from the blood that became sure again </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10 yesterday. Anniversary her/its/their foundation, and her/its/their president, Dr. Francine Décary, had to be happy all reason, because Hema-Quebec has turned into one of the surest and most efficient blood-banks of the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And in particular she/it has regained the trust of the public, that had become badly shaken through the scandal of the infested blood in the 1980er and 1990er years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As one knows, the national blood-reserves administered by the blood-donate-service of the Canadian red cross were hepatitis contaminated during the 1980er years with the HI-Virus and him/it C-Virus. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In view of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the government Canada led a public in February 1994, through the judge Horace Krever led examination one, that had to the goal, to bring light into the circumstances, that had led to a such tragedy, and, to work out guidelines, to prevent about a renewed catastrophe of this type. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While judge Krever still hesitated to hand over his/its report, several provinces put a committee on the legs, his goal was it, at that time to develop a new system into the administration of blood-cans in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In Quebec, the committee filled Gélineau this job. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood-banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, that is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood-society, to look after around the other provinces and the two territories. </seg>
<seg id="9"> `1998, as Hema-Quebec has lifted her/its/their work, 38% of the people hardly had trust into the blood-can-system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was discouraging. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Through the enormous efforts, to improve about the security of the blood-cans, and through the work in this area during the following years, we have the trust of the public zurückgewonnen', she/it says before she/it emphasizes with pride that almost 94% of the population of Quebec had trust in Hema-Quebec start of 2008 in the meantime. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Dr. Décary keeps in the consciousness however that `Vertrauen somewhat extremely fragile ist'. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since her/its/their foundation at the 28. September 1998 trades Hema-Quebec after the principle of the caution. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At this time, we experienced the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of the beef-craziness in Europe with, a new type of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Krankheit, this woman, who occupies the management since the foundation 1998, tells. </seg>
<seg id="15"> `Und we it didn't have the lowest idea whether this illness could be transferred over the blood. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Therefore we referred to one of the main-guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, that according to one applies Ausschlussmaßnahmen, if one doesn't know this and if an illness progresses only slowly as it is the case, that expresses itself through a degeneration of the brain, with the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Krankheit obviously what leads invariably to the death. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore, they assumed no blood of persons that had been since 1980 longer than one month in the united kingdom in April 1999. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Now, before some years was proven without each doubt, that this illness is transferred over the blood. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So this event has shown us that the principle of the caution, that we would apply, absolutely has a sense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> 1999, a much more exact technology appeared on the market to the recognition of HIV: The nucleic acid-tests (NST), that make possible it to prove the occurrence of the virus itself in the blood of the donor directly, and not that of the antibodies against that virus, as it was the case with the tests used until now. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The NST made possible it to shorten the incubation period, that between the time to which the person was infected and that, if the first viruses can be proven by our technologies in the blood, takes place, the specialist explains. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The risk became so that certain donors could be infected without knowing it and could not recognize this one, essentially reduces. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These improvements made possible it, the risk, AIDS over a blood-transfusion too figurative to lower in considerable measurement. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Nowadays, one of 12 million persons is at risk to get infected blood with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="26"> `Mit other words is called that that one had to would distribute 12 million blood-cans before somebody would be infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Since Hema-Quebec distributes every year between 400.000 and 500.000 blood-cans, it would last more than 24 years before a case, with which HIV was transferred over a blood-can, appears. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I believe that one can feel well with it nowadays if one receives a blood-transfusion or prescribes, about the health wiederherzustellen', the management-boss of Hema-Quebec thinks. </seg>
<seg id="29"> `Unsere challenge for the next ten years is it to get the security of our products. </seg>
<seg id="30"> One never knows which pathogene can reach into the system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Only in the last year, Réunion has appeared on the island the Chikungunya-Virus, that, equally like that west-Nile-virus, through insects over the blood is transferred. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We must überwachen' continuously, continues Dr. Décary, before she/it emphasizes, that Hema-Quebec beside a certain care must make available a sufficient care furthermore. </seg>
<seg id="33"> `Der demand climbs because the population ages. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Since the treatments are more aggressive to the cancer-fight, the patients often need new red blood corpuscles or blood-little tiles. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The Überalterung of the population has an effect also on the blood-donor-network, to which belongs in the average only 3% the resident of Quebec suitable to the blood-contribution. ' </seg>
<seg id="36"> Each healthy human being can with it, that 18 years or older is and the suitability-criterions fills, all 56 days, therefore six marks in the year, blood donate. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In the average, 14% of the persons, that make available her/its/their blood, are not assumed, because has sickened she/it at AIDS or malaria for example, and whoever has traveled is excluded for one year of the blood-contribution into a country, in which malaria is dispersed. </seg>
<seg id="38"> `Mit these 3% manages we to get an inventory, that correspond to the needs of the hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Lacking supplies are very rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But one must renew the members of this donor-network if they become older and can donate no blood more. </seg>
<seg id="41"> It is heavy to convince the people of it to donate blood, above all however, to hold her/it/them and to bring her/it/them to it, to become regular donors. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The life is so hectic nowadays that one rarely finds the time, a hour with the blood-contribution to verbringen', Francine Décary regrets. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With a year-It-budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood-cans but also human tissues, under it bone-transplants, heart-tabs, eyeballs and skin, that use almost exclusively with heavy fire-injuries, becomes. </seg>
<seg id="44"> These tissues are examined, processes and freezes up, before they are between-stored with Hema-Quebec, that administers also the only public umbilical cord-blood-bank of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In the umbilical cord, at which was looked earlier than biomedical waste, rich blood, that can be used for it, is at trunk-cells to treat heavy illnesses, like for example leukemia. </seg>
<seg id="46"> `Vors some weeks celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord-blood sample we, and we plan to decrease annually more than thousand. </seg>
<seg id="47"> `Wirs should probably begin beginning of next year with it, it for transplants to the disposal to stellen', explains Dr. Décary further, that this program of that umbilical cord-blood - decrease as very popular describes. </seg>
<seg id="48"> `Viele mothers are convinced of it, no access to it to haben', because Hema-Quebecs are missing the methods to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals of Quebec. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> The `Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a `Vision ' that the premier has for Quebec supposedly, namely that of a `neuen Wirtschaftsraumes', that an unification with France respecting manpower, an agreement between Canada and Europe and unifications with Ontario intends. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although she/it was mentioned in the speeches of the premier recently frequently, the opening of the north was - the northern area on the 49sten degree of latitude - never topic of a presentation been. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The premier limited to state on it however, why the north is `ein jewel with enormous Potential', named no date, no investment-sums or exact priorities for the coming projects however. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At most some outlooks on that, at which could be worked more,: Above all at the water-energy, at the forest, but particularly at the mining-sector, favors through the growth of the newly industrializing countries and the renewal of the public infrastructures. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Outside opinion - the orwellsche speech of Barrick gold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In her/its/their edition of the 17. September published Le Devoir a letter dated Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-general director of the Canadian gold-mine Barrick gold. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms, and pursues an orwellsche logic with it that the biggest gold-extraction-society of the world a slander-complaint over six millions against three authors and a young impecunious publishing house-home strove for, with the goal, a `öffentliche, to open transparent Debatte'. </seg>
<seg id="4"> If it is correct, that the judges are independent and impartial, then they don't pass a judgment on the truth, above all not in the case of slander-complaints but over the law. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As expect, this basic difference became completely discreet from Mr. Garver. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Because for Barrick gold, the best type is one to lead a public debate to drive everyone into the ruin, that it dares, that its reverse notion to represent. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Quite same, as the process goes out, the authors and the editor of the book of Noir Canada will have to pass out considerable sums in order to prepare her/its/their defense and to fight with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers, that are paid from the nearly inexhaustible bags of the gold-mine. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The tactic with these unequal fights is often besides to be ruined the defenders in order to force an einvernehmliche regulation, that the other side makes silent, and furthermore everyone, that dares it, to deal with the question again, deters. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If Barrick gold really wanted a public debate, she/it would have had to present her/its/their view of the things before the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In contrast to it, what in many that countries, in which Barrick gold works, walk and would give is, normally becomes debates in Canada through the exchange of ideas and delivered not through stick-blows. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It would therefore have sufficed if the gold-mine had disclosed her/its/their books and files and a real debate would have opened, through the newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent Prüfteams that would have been able to bring light into this question. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But Barrick gold seems no trust to have into the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to the support of the authors of Noir Canada with a sweep of the hand aside. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Could Mr. Garver explain maybe, as simultaneously he/it about a `öffentliche ' debate can ask and with it however the opinions just this public disregards? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Seemingly, this word includes only the generously paid lawyers in the world of the vice-president, and not the community of all Canadians; a quite beautifully restricted view-manner of the concept. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy, slanderers even have to speak the right. </seg>
<seg id="16"> What Barrick gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is, that the public, that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, therefore toots this above all, because she/it refuses the brutal stand of the gold-mine. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This public is ready to it to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework, that many perceive as gag-complaint, in the course of the `öffentlichen Debatte', Barrick gold has directed exactly a demand at the authors of Noir Canada, in which she/it demands from them, to use this concept no longer...). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Apart from the surreal speech of Mr. Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct attack on the freedom to the academic research and the truth-finding that is fundamentally for each democratic society. </seg>
<seg id="19"> She/it denies the right completely to quote believable sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, that the basis of the intellectual work forms. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore topics and to discuss, that pleased not the rich businesses of this world, whoever can do that then otherwise? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If Barrick gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she/it could lead these in that she/it follows the scientific norms, that use from the authors of Noir Canada, became. </seg>
<seg id="22"> She/it has a right to answer. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The universitäre surroundings, to which we belong, knows for a long time to get the grip on debates and incongruities and to solve conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold clearly shows that she/it, in contrast to him/it, which she/it pretends, has no desire on a transparent debate. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is a loss for the university-world, equally like for the public debate, and it becomes time that the governments take measures, that restrict this type of unjustified complaints. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The administration Bush and the leading congresspersons, Republican and Democrats likewise, finally came to an unification over the most extensive economic-rescue-plan since the big depression of the 30er years yesterday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The new version of the plan over 700 billion U.S. dollars that should stop the finance-crisis, that jars them/her/it embankment Street already for months, must still be assumed from the two congress-chambers. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The main-contents are: , To secure a better control of the deputy over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms, about the repayment of the started public moneys, new disposals, to dam about the number of that on the basis of houses impounded by payment-remains, just as the right to oversee the salaries, that are paid at the leading employees of the backed businesses. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The American finance-secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the deputy-chamber Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republican, present with the negotiations, senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, some minutes after midnight, the good piece of news, after a two-day negotiation-marathon. </seg>
<seg id="6"> `Wirs have made big advances in direction of an unification, that market-effectively his/its wird', the representative of the administration Bush, Henry Paulson, explained. </seg>
<seg id="7"> `Es happened to everything, about the real economy and the American people before the course-crisis at the embankment Street to schützen', the Democrat explained. </seg>
<seg id="8"> `Dies is the basic point: If we the doesn't do, the trauma, the chaos and the unrests become sein's in the daily life of the Americans enormously, the Republican Judd Gregg explained. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The negotiations had accelerated during the last both hours, from fear before the effect, that would have had a renewed failure on the mood of the investors. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The period, that had been arranged, was morning the market-opening today. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The two American presidency-candidates, who took part in the negotiations first late, appeared the unification sooner than advocates without missing however to express her/its/their dissatisfaction over it that one must be met her/it/them with this extreme way. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The democratic senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain disposals to the unification, above all such, that it should enable the owners to keep her/its/their houses, and such that the salaries of the leading employee involve the establishment escaped by the state. </seg>
<seg id="13"> `Wenn one the taxpayers therefore, to take extraordinary measures on the basis of the irresponsibility of certain persons, asks, that is nothing, on which they could congratulate itself. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But these measures are notwendig's, he/it explained on the American television-stations. </seg>
<seg id="15"> As he/it was asked on another station, whether he/it will vote for the proposed plan, his/its republican opponent John McCain answered: `Ich would like to know the details first, but I hope it. </seg>
<seg id="16"> `Die guiding principle, that I have read, [shows], that this is a matter, that we all will have to digest, and we will be able to make progress with her/it. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The option to do nothing at all quite simply is not akzeptabel', he/it said. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The 700 billion dollar-arrangement is organized on it, with the money of the taxpayers </seg>
<seg id="19"> He/it comes 14 months after a crisis, through bursting of a real estate-blister caused that first led the high-risk hypo-bar-credit (Subprime) to the breakdown, before she/it widened on further forms of more dispersed bonds, PCAA, and led finally into a freezing up the finance-strength and into the ruin of the banks and money-institutes. </seg>
<seg id="20"> A group republican deputy was it, let the last week fail the first attempt to the unification. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Since the Democrats have accepted that certain `giftige ' assets of the societies in distress only of the government secured and should not be bought, one believes itself from the dead end escaped. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In order to round off the viewpoints for finished in the congress, one has added also a disposal, that means, that, if the government should do with this program within five years of losses, could raise her/it/them new taxes then, all the her/its/their started capital, to get back. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The new plan intends the payment of a first sum of 250 billions, to which can 100 billions further to arrive, if the president looks at it for necessary. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The payment further 350 billions must be given a farewell in a renewed vote of the congress. </seg>
<seg id="25"> As a countermove for his/its help Washington gets shares in the backed businesses, that bring in to him/it in the case of profits dividends, and that can sell it again if the storm is past drawn. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Federal government will have the possibility, the seizure-procedures respecting the apartments, that are tied at the real estate-credits concerned by this plan, to detain, and to fix periods for the repayment and the settlements furthermore, that are paid at the leading employees of the concerned businesses. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The developers of the plan would have gladly that the deputy-chamber votes on him/it already today, and the senate then on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Despite all of her/its/their efforts, it is not yet sure that her/its/their plan will receive green light. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Actually, further votes began against this intent, as well as from sides of the Republican also as the Democrats, yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="30"> `Ganz obviously understands Washington us nicht', the Republican Scott Garett, member of the finance-commission of the chamber, explained his/its voters. </seg>
<seg id="31"> `Ja, we have a big financial problem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Yes, there are solutions. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But not that, that consist of it, the taxpayers to the cash register to bitten'. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The democratic Abgeordnete Brad Sherman, leaders of a group in the congress, who is named `der Kaukus of the Skeptiker', puts the things differently there, comes to the same conclusion however. </seg>
<seg id="35"> `Vierhunderts excellent economic-professors, under it three Nobel laureates, have written us in order to communicate us: We ask the congress to have put not down itself under pressure, and careful too superior, which way to become a hit ist', he/it explained yesterday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> At the same time, we received renewed the proof in Europe that it is about a world-wide crisis. </seg>
<seg id="37"> With an emergency-meeting, the three Benelux-countries quit the partial nationalization of the Bankengruppe Fortis for 11,2 billions Euro, 16,3 billion U.S. dollars, at. </seg>

<seg id="40"> ' That is no lost money, the Dutch finance-minister Wouter Bos explained yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="41"> To the balance, we get a right to vote and influence in the bank. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Exactly that, which the savers and households estimate, is now there this itself uncertain times announces. ' </seg>
<seg id="43"> During this time, the British government was on the other side of the sleeve-canal exactly with it, another of the finance-crisis, to nationalize brought bank in distress. </seg>

<seg id="9"> Miscellaneous blood often yields wonderful children. </seg>
<seg id="10"> He/it was born 1925 in Ohio as son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-stocky mother. </seg>
<seg id="11"> One of the glorious faces of the American dream should originate from his/its European roots. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Without excessive ego, most outer quality-characteristic. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Because a whole country, that was in love with the Self-made-man, mirrored itself in him/it into the fighter, who was injured in the Pacific-war in the skirmish, the beginning of the 50er years of histrionics in Yale again, the Actor's studio in New York studied and then visited, before he/it success at the theater, in the television and had soon also in the cinema. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Just this man, who fought for the franchises, was also the driver, who became 1979 with the 24-Stunden-Rennen of Mans Zweiter, and furthermore a Sexsymbol, although he/it lived together with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a token-relationship. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Also the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained vanish with him/it, engaged and opposite the Glamour of the show business oversensitive stars, his puzzles one will never solve completely. </seg>
<seg id="16"> A decent man, in the purest sense of the word. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The death Paul Newmans put the cinema-lovers this weekend into giddiness while all his/its big roles were played on the dark screen of the memories. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Passes by more than a half century of American film-art in continuous change with him/it. </seg>

<seg id="31"> In contrast to several cinema-legends, that have retreated from the movie world sufficiently early, Newman should remain in the saddle long, and with it Hollywood, his/its fortune, his/its splendor and his/its concessions betrays. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The French film-maker of Bertrand Tavernier saw him/it, not without humor, as living challenge at the `Underplaying ', as he/it judged his/its all too oratorical performances. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, whom the roles flew long time only so. </seg>

<seg id="41"> We probably have him/it with the foot in peels Vinaigrette fully often, sees stand in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this for rather tasteless held, although we initially still found it merrily. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The profits from his/its turnovers nevertheless flowed into his/its foundation for children in need. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Instead of resting on his/its myth, Newman committed itself up to the shot. </seg>
<seg id="44"> He/it left his/its five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Immer and until completely to the end, your father was incredibly gratefully for his/its good star. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It was a honor, here, to be able to be. ' </seg>
<seg id="46"> And it was a honor to be able to pursue the life of a so intelligent and generous American actor for us. </seg>

<seg id="14"> How is to be taken displayed bills in the year 2003 two of surcharge and Co, the gastronomy-business should have entertained the ninety-headed group of the club Biztos Pont Egyesület. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Now the boss of the business declares however, a so big group was not open in-fited into the pub. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Another bill, displayed in the summer 2002 on the foundation work Jöv?ért, later known as Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért, also serious form - and content-mistake showed. </seg>

<seg id="44"> Nevertheless, he/it could profit from the businesses: On requests of his/its accomplice, the lawyer's Zsolt Szente, that was engaged with the preparation of the Firmengründungsunterlagen, he/it has displayed bills at the clubs brought with surcharge in connection in the name of the companies, like approximately at Atlasz and Y-Generáció. </seg>

<seg id="46"> The public prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the bill-sum as well as the value added tax in each case. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Kubatov shall even the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the showing of fictitious bills has abused - in this case was enclosed the bills the applications of Biztos Pont. </seg>

<seg id="48"> The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért have her/its/their applications with the nonprofit organization of the socialistic party in January 2006, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA ") handed over. </seg>

<seg id="54"> His/its previous statements were namely less elaborate, and although he/it had already promised several times to report inclusively on everything, his/its confession still endures. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The question remains therefore open whether this lies in his/its interest whether the socialists have finished a pact with him/it respecting the recompense of the bulk of the originated damage of HOOF 50 million, and whether surcharge is as a countermove ready to adopt the responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="56"> It is however absolutely possible that surcharge now plays the " offended " after his/its pleas had come upon mitigation of the imprisonment and house-arrest on numb ears. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> With auctions, the buyers are inclined to it to spend more and to overestimate the sold consequently. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Neurologists and economic-researchers of the university of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to one in the " Science " magazine of published study, the people want fight in a competition, like approximately one auction on eBay, gives and is therefore ready to pay even raised prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this " game " with experimental auctions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A group of the volunteer should play lottery, during the other at a playful action participated - in both cases became the active brain-regions of the probationers by means of more functionally more magnetically resonance (fMRI) examines. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> With both games, the participants could win money, however an elevated activity of the Striatum, a complex below the brain-bark, with losers of the auction, with which outbidding of the opponent plays an essential role, was measured. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Beside many other functions, this brain-region is responsible for the " self-reward " of the nervous system. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The researchers therefore thought, the price-increase could be explained through the avoidance of a Überreaktion of the Striatums. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In order to substantiate her/its/their thesis, the economists have employed examinations to the Nachverfolgung of the money in the researcher-group additionally. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this case, three groups should mitbieten against a partner under different conditions. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Of the true value of the product was informed the control-group, they have done her/its/their uses after it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> 15 dollars of reward were promised another group in addition, for the case, that they emerge as winners from the game. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The third group got 15 dollars before the auction, that was also lost in the case of a lost game. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The difference between both groups consisted therefore merely of it that the emphasis with the one on the gain, while lay with the other on losing. </seg>
<seg id="16"> As the members of the " group playing against the loses " were ready proof for the hypothesis expressed by neurologists to higher uses however, as those in her/it control - as well as the " Gewinn"-Gruppe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> " These results can be derived from no former economic-theory. </seg>
<seg id="18"> These have the behaviors observed with auctions only with the joy over the gain up to now namely, as well as the risk-avoidance justifies. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Suffers approximately one half billion individual under chronic hepatitis B or C world-wide, and in Hungary, this chronic liver-illness is listed under the leading causes of death. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The number the infected is estimated on hundred thousand in these parts, however only seven thousand are treated what is because of it that the patients don't often know that they are infected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Hepatitis is the collective-concept for through different viruses caused, infectious liver-illnesses. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The symptoms are often like - hepatitis and jaundice is frequent, however the viruses and the illnesses differ of each other. </seg>
<seg id="6"> According to viruses, the hepatitis-viruses spread on two different types: with hepatitis AT and E through the digestive-section, for example through impure foods or water, with hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transferred by blood and other body-liquids (like approximately sperm, divorce-secretion or saliva). </seg>
<seg id="7"> Travelers become a vaccination against the viruses AT and B anyway recommended, against the virus C, there is no vaccine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The symptoms with hepatitis AT appears approximately two-three weeks after consumption of the impure food and is accompanied by Unwohlbefinden, weakness, stomach aches and nausea in general. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The jaundice appears on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes light, the urine dark, and the convalescence can up to two-three weeks long lasts. </seg>
<seg id="10"> World-wide, people die annually approximately 1 million of the by hepatitis B caused, much heavier illnesses like liver-cancer and liver-cirrhosis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Main-reason for this it is that is estimations according to only each tenth infected in medikamentöser treatment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Also hepatitis C can have serious consequences: unbehandelt can lead it to liver-cirrhosis and liver-cancer. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Most infected know about her/its/their illness not once since the virus destroys the liver-cells insidiously - in many cases appears the first symptoms after 20-30 years. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Timely preventing is therefore, as approximately regular control-examinations, imperative. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There are three groups, in which this illness occurs more frequently,: those, that have undergone before 1991 of a blood-transfusion, Drogenabhängige, and tattooed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At present, the number of that is estimated sickened on 200 million at chronic hepatitis C world-wide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Since the illness is already verifiable with a routine laboratory-examination, it is advisable to visit the house-doctor with the first indications of unknown origin. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> How newest research-results cover that the religious belief acts as a type " analgesic " that should already have relieved the death of Catholic martyrs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Scientists of the Oxford University have enforced an interesting experiment: It was examined, in what way the belief at God influences the Schmerzempfinden of the human being, the British leaf " telegraph " reported. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the course of the rather bizarre examination, it got per 12 believers and Atheist Elektroschocks while they studied a painting of God's mother. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the results showed, the believers could turn off the bulk of the pains. </seg>
<seg id="6"> By means of a Hirn-Scan technology, one could even prove that the Catholics could activate the part of her/its/their brain, that for the pain-regulation responsible is. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The examination was the first in a research-project, at which participates also philosophers and theologians of different departments of the university beside scientists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> With the attempt, a glistening appliance was tied up the probationers to the left hand which handed over the electro-shocks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two paintings: To the one a picture of God's mother, painted from Sassoferrato in the 17. Century, and to the other Leonardo there Vincis " lady with the ermine ". </seg>
<seg id="10"> The researchers hoped that the sight of the virgin Maria under the believer would evoke a type religious trance while they selected Vincis picture there because it hardly differed from the other painting and as calms was felt. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The test persons spent per a half hour in a MRI scanner, and got altogether 20 electro-shocks in this time in four stages, while either she/it the religious, or the other painting should look at. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Catholics reported, they would have felt with the sight of God's " mother in security ", as if they " would be umsorgts ", and they would have felt silence and peace ". </seg>
<seg id="13"> During the considers of the religious painting, they have reported over 12% few pains, as if they had Leonardos work before eyes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, thought, they could evoke similar effects also with other, strongly working pictures also with the atheists, one had to would find the corresponding photo merely. </seg>
<seg id="15"> " We had to would find a picture, that causes very positive sensations, as approximately one mother or a father ", according to the psychologist. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="16"> The Anglican bishop Tom Wright greeted the results of the research. </seg>
<seg id="17"> " Practicing of the belief should change our personality, and toots it also in many cases ", according to Wright. </seg>
<seg id="18"> After these outstanding results, the question only remains which effect a Madonna-picture of Leonardos or another comparable painter would have on the pain-regulation of the believer. </seg>

<seg id="2"> On the occasion of her/its/their tenth birthday, Google can claim with justification and right: she/it is to be found equally in the bags of the people, as over her/its/their heads at the heaven: She/it knows where the people have spent her/its/their vacation to which specialists they go, and something she/it moves. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And with it still not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the managers of Google. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In direction skeptics, that are troubled by Orwellschen horror-visions, has organized he/it: These would overlook the essential of the Web 2.0 precisely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Schmidt thought in an interview with the Financial Time lately, the main goal of Google is it to collect personal data over the users even more and according to the original objective of the company, to come near, according to what she/it " wants to sort " all information of this world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Schmidt explained, Google is still world-changing work after ten years at the beginning of the Informations-Sammelns only. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Asked Quo after the status in five years Schmidt thought: he/it wished, Google would be in the situation, I should do " questions like " what tomorrow? or " which job really goes with me "? , to answer, however software-programs are not yet in the situation to it since they would not know sufficiently about the users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Not all Internet-Users are in the clear to itself over it that the Suchbegriffes would be registered in the course of her/its/their Internet-Recherchen, as well as also the IP-Adressen, from which from was sought, and the visited sides. </seg>
<seg id="9"> For example the Personalized Search " introduced " two years ago licenses the visitor to store his/its own Suchverlauf and to fall back on it later, sodass the hits later much more precisely can be generated, and also the so named " Recommendationses ", with which the system recommends custom products and services on the basis of the former preferences, are based on the same logic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The User wonder however - " if one, which I do ", looks - appears some procured whether the Google-Datenmonopols. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In most cases, it is however rather that of the company represented, potenzielle power, that works fear exhilarating, and less the compunction or the fear before punishment, the quest after freedom or rebelling against the power that pushes with many Internet-Userns on refusal. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a proven fact however, that the Suchbegriffes are stored not only but are relayed in the Anlassfall also at third, and in this Gesetzesfällen, there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet-Users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A parade-example for this was the action against Pädophilie in Brazil, in the course of his Google of the Brazilian government gave information, that was collected by the Gemeinschaftssite by the name of " Orkut " and enabled also an identification of the Pädophilien, lately. </seg>
<seg id="14"> User concerned about personal rights could however still breathe a sigh of relief in May as Google pulled successfully with the franchise-organization EFF against the FBI before court together: therefore, Google can be forced also in future with no point of the constitution into it, information the FBI, to publish on secret inquiry. </seg>
<seg id="15"> , However the Federal government has obtained the publication of 50.000 Web-addresses and 1.000 Suchbegriffens under reference on the youth-protection-law given a farewell years ago successfully, however the list of the individual User became her/it/them, respectively their Web - and Suchbegriffsliste on two months retroactively withholds.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Googles image therefore remains controversial: Those, that publish her/its/their personal data unwillingly, because she/it through the application of the Google-Dienste the loss her/its/their private - and private life fears, conservatively representing companies of proper revolt chastise the business with her/it him/it itself. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Meanwhile, the American " Geek-Kultur " sees that is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer-fans, activists and User eint, the next generation of the " cool entrepreneurs " in them, in contrast to Microsoft, that is thanks to Windows Marktführer, even if fights both around the same goal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> A possible reason for this it is that Google demands his/its Usern in contrast to Microsoft no identification-codes, and his/its services gratuitously to the disposal puts, sodass an open, constantly updated source code and Programm-Package much attractive, youthful and cool, to be, seems, as the official methods of the software-giant. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the other hand, the Geekses understand the problematic relationship of the personal right and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship, that has especially moved in the last years thanks to the concept " Web 2.0 " into the center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> With the " Web 2.0 " goes it about nothing other namely, than about collaboration, speaks that User leave on purpose tracks and is of use the available communication-canals, and even if the sizes are individually different, the most important thing remains the same to appear namely publicly. </seg>
<seg id="21"> An average teenager can administer his/its profile on several Gemeinschaftsportalen simultaneously - from Facebook over Xanga, this can by means of other services, like approximately Twitter, or music-services connect like last.fm together, and can finally tie in all this into a Nachverfolgungssystem like approximately FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead Blogs, that represents the newest photo-galleries, that are geostets on Flickr or Picasa, automatically. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> And a row of further exemplary cases proves: The friend finds out with the respect of the party-photos of the bygone night soon, with whom her/its/their disloyal friend has had a good time, or the co-worker is released because he/it makes his/its anger in his/its Blog over the management air only all too honestly - an is sure: The concept " privacy " was interpreted fully again in the meantime. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Whoever leads an on-line-life is that, which he/it announces from itself, - so in for example could formulate the reason-idea behind the behavior of the present-day youth one. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And whoever tries to hold somewhat secretly, or cooks to handle the Google-Monopol, that can like to do - like approximately with Scroogle, a Tool, that admittedly accesses the Suchmaschine of Google, however on purpose no tracks leaves. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Not few people don't register on community-sides on purpose so that they are not findable, but also the on-line-applications of Google, as approximately Textverarbeitungs - and graphic Tools and RSS-Feeds, has handled itself alternative versions, that are tied at no gigantic server-parks and don't generate the best possible profile of the User therefore either. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The public opinion waits entranced on it meanwhile until Google shows her/its/their true face. </seg>
<seg id="27"> With her/its/their present value of USD 156 bil. lie the business before IBM even, USD 140 bil.), Intel, USD 124 bil.) or Coca-Cola, USD 110 bil.), the advertising-surfaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of the advertising-agencies, and the services more quickly introduced always make ready not only Microsoft but also other software-developers head-breakup. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Critical observers find however also the worrying counterpoles: So the concern-management has fully rejected a protest of the co-workers approximately, after the dues of the company kindergarten were doubled, furthermore the management, that is mehrmalige food of the co-workers, thought too costly. That of everything appears however virtually mildly against it that Google even went in the year 2006 before the Chinese government into the knees and agreed with an agreement after what all regime-critical hits, or those, that offend against the good taste, would be out-filtered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The internal regulation of the concern is that no new service is applied in advance but only when this is also already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and year could roll up some powerfully again: While some thinks, Googles book - and Magazinscan - as well as Archivierungsprojekt assumes sizes in the meantime that the business had to have it out with the colonel court of justice soon, is rather others worried because of the system " Health " so, that the preparation of a complete health-profile on the basis of from results, doctors and problems enables. </seg>
<seg id="30"> And the fact, that Google builds a genetic data base, already delivers the material to the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors - approximately " Scroogled ", the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes a future, in which a human being becomes nahbar thanks to data referential by Google startling, in best orwellschen manner. </seg>

<seg id="3"> For example that of the bees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> An astonishing project, with which the Nissan-Ingenieures of bumble-bees were inspired new accident of avoiding systems with the creation, was introduced with the CEATEC in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In cooperation with the Tokioter university, Nissan has built the biomimetic system of the type BR23C controlled by car-robots, a mini-car, equipped with the qualities of the bees, with the goal to support the development of a system, that each collisions avoid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the flight, each bee forms her/its/their own, oval " privacy ", that our own " shield " is very similar, Kazuhhiro Doi said, product-managers for Technologie-PR and research-development, at the showing. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The composite eye of the bee, that can see into each direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role with it. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance-knife. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates her/its/their distances and sends signals at the microprocessor at board, that immediately introduces the collision-avoiding process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The obstacle is registered in second-fractions, and the car-robot immediately alters the course, like the movement of the bees, in that he/it turns the tires about the corresponding angle. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This maneuver takes place purely instinctively in contrast to previous systems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> " If it was not so, the car-robot could not react declared Toshiyuki Andoh, leaders of the " Mobility Laboratory " and the car-robot-project, sufficiently quickly in order to avoid " the obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The system must respond instinctively and immediately since this technology corresponds to the most inner and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer, within the accidents at present still as unvermeidbar is valid. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The entire process must reflect holding back of the bees if they avoid other bees. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And that must run out in the fraction of a second. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, the evasion, in contrast to the bees, doesn't can up, down, or takes place even diagonally - it can be only two-dimensional, in fact only in direction of the Wendbarkeit of the tires. </seg>
<seg id="17"> While infinitely many possibilities stand the bees here frankly in order to avoid other bees, the researchers could themselves with the car-robot of only the rotation, respectively the accelerates and brake serves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BR23C contains Lithium-Polymerbatterien, that is easier and energy-more efficient, and a longer lifespan therefore has, as conventional Lithium-Ionenbatterien. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Andoh explained, it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less, to store these on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> This appliance must process some inputs per second merely and accordingly on her/it/them must respond. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It must this doesn't store, or on the basis of former maneuvers an intuitive, logical reaction produces, sodass it continuously merely one handful KB of memory in claim takes. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It needs no gigabytes - and megabyte-heavy Memories. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision-avoidance-technology, that will be after assessment of Nissan within the next ten years in production in series. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Another application could find the technology with the GPS-Satellitennavigation in that it steers the motorist about obstacles around consciously and leads him/it at the goal so. </seg>

<seg id="3"> In the first passageway, half of the money should be passed out. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In a session, that came local time East coast on Saturday after midnight to an end, the congresspersons have themselves after several days' debates to an unification over the 700-Milliarden-Dollar severe rescue-packet durchgerungen, Reuters reported. </seg>
<seg id="5"> " We have achieved " essential advances, Nancy Pelosi said, democratic president in the American deputy-house, and thought, one must only write down the unification. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The achieved compromise over the rescue-package backed both presidency-candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Finance-minister Henry Paulson thought to the result: The program will show effect and it becomes efficient, one must do even more however. Loudly Pelosi was not it here about the rescue the embankment Street but about it, the rudder of the economy rumzureißen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The written setting of the package still became before the opening of the Asian markets, therefore, Washingtoner time Sunday evening 8 o'clock, Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning, publishes, has caused no height-flight on the stock exchanges however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On Monday, the deputy-house first votes on the bill to the stabilization of the economy of 2008, the senate is next then. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> President George W. Bush spoke on the Saturday evening with Pelosi, and also that white house greeted the news over the unification. </seg>
<seg id="11"> We are content with the advances achieved in the night and estimate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, Tony Fratto said, speakers of the white house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The program deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush-administration however, after which the 700 bil. Dollar all at once for the purchase lazy, with credits of incriminated investments should be spent. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a first tranche, half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages should be passed out at most, with what 250 bil. it is immediately available after the congress will vote on Monday on the Causa as expected. This sum should be used for the purchase of credit-incriminated, bad investments, and over the further 100 bil. USD should adjudicate the president. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The program is checked by an individual commission, that also the president of the Federal reserve belongs. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The other half the 700 bil. depend on another decision of the congress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the sense of the law, the department of Finance can apply also a combined tactic: It can bad credits, mortgages, simultaneously and incriminated investments buy with mortgages, or also other " poisonous " credits. </seg>
<seg id="17"> How responsible persons of the ministry reported, the purchase can as well as in an auction, as also takes place directly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The law makes possible it for the concerned companies to take part in an insurance-program, with which the department of Finance guarantees the worrying methods, and pays the businesses to the too expectant damages corresponding dues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary methods so that up to 700 bil. Dollar as immediately-help for the American financial system to the disposal can be put, be it for the big aimed purchase of bad methods, her/its/their insurance, or the avoidance of a system-risk, that is caused by the collapse of a bigger money-institute. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We put down the necessary steps so that we are ready to the introduction of the law as soon as it was signed, according to Paulson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The bosses of that in difficulties gotten and now on state help dependent banks can calculate with it however that her/its/their dispatches, that are named Golden Handshake ", from which government is shortened, in the overseas-slang careless ". </seg>
<seg id="22"> There will be a shortening of the salaries only in certain cases, and these shortenings will depend on it as the department of Finance helps out in each case. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The shortening essentially means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, according to the " Golden Handshake " is taxed, unless, the finished Bankenchef is pushed into the pension. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The government will intervene aggressively in the case of a direct purchase of the lazy credits in order to guarantee that the manager-salaries are not exaggerated. </seg>
<seg id="25"> To the picture, it also belongs that the existing Golden Handshake-Verträges are not altered - the restrictions it refers only to new agreements so that umsos take part more people in the program. </seg>
<seg id="26"> That is the first case in the American history, that shortenings are regulated with manager-salaries per law, the Democrat Barney wrote a commentary on Frank, chairperson of the finance-committee, the measure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> The state gains participation-rights the participating banks, sodass the risk for the taxpayers it sinks since they can also participate, as soon as it the economy and with it also the rescued bank again better goes. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The bill intends that the president must present a suggestion to the congress in the next five years as the taxpayers should get back her/its/their lost money from the finance-sector again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> There were skeptics, that have expressed her/its/their doubts in reference to the plan, for both sides however. </seg>
<seg id="30"> That is not that, which the American citizens of us expect, the plan the money of the taxpayers protects on no account, according to the Californian Republican Darrell Issa. </seg>
<seg id="31"> His/its colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur thought: The measures were advanced by the same persons, who are responsible the embankment also for the collapse Street. </seg>

<seg id="3"> In their speech directional at the plenum, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz-Abgeordnete of the European people-party, especially alerted to the educational-segregation, since this one of the most serious infringements, that happen to Roma-Kindern, is, furthermore this is the biggest obstacle for their validity-need. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Thinks Russian observers, this is because of the affluence and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko that OECD suspects however illegalities with the count of the votes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The OECD, that has sent out 450 observers from 43 countries, has not acknowledged the elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> De legislature of the 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates admittedly makes do since decades without opposition. Nevertheless that has hoped itself them/her/it under the name " united democratic strengths " (ODS) of gathered opposing side before the previous elections seriously that Lukaschenko, that already renewed his/its presidency-mandate for the fourth time with the unclean elections and thanks to an amendment 2006, would admit " some deputy of the opposition in the parliament " this time. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Therefore, the ODS has even taken distance from the boycotts planned before. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Ukraine becomes economically ever more dependent thanks to the climbing prices with the natural gas-import from Russia. For the relief of the price-increases, even credits were lifted, and the country has agreed also to the sale of the Beltransgas, the owner of the Gaspipeline leading through the country, at the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition, the hope therefore stood, the Ukraine wants to improve her/its/their relationship with the EC, after Lukaschenko and other high-ranking politicians because of the as anti-democratically classified political system in the EC entry-prohibition has. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Despite all that, the opposition is able an improvement in the political system recognizes: Political prisoners became approximately sedate on free foot, and Minsk is even ready to smaller confrontations with Moscow in that it still refuses the acknowledgment of the independence of the apostate georgischen provinces South-Ossetia and Abchasien although Russia, with which the Ukraine forms a federal-state on the paper, has considered the two areas for one month independent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> " We have two steps onward and done one backwards, but the most important is, that the dialogue has begun between Weißrussland and the EC, Alexander Milinkewitsch said to our leaf. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In the opinion of the opposition-candidate of the presidency-elections of 2006, a continuation is desirable, although " has received the heroic anxiety to let " also only an opposition into the parliament. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The opposition plans no protest-measures in view of the results but tries the necessity of an economic-reform the voters sooner clear-shuts. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="14"> " We have to fight with many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us with the distribution stones into the way, but nevertheless I see that people support the change more and more, even the older " - said Milinkewitsch in allusion to it, that not once the most-backed layer of the pensioners agrees with the Lukaschenko-Regime, his single merit is the manufacture of social security. </seg>
<seg id="15"> " Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the increase of the trade deficit, it is a question of the time merely, until begins " to crumble the social security " reminding " at the silence of a graveyard, according to Milinkewitsch. </seg>

<seg id="5"> This example mentioned just is only a small part of the big changes, that the momentary economic earthquake announces or even already represents, meanwhile: not only in the USA, also in the entire west and maybe also over this will be concerned from these. </seg>
<seg id="6"> As well as in the states also as in Europe seems the crisis to accelerate the events feared long, which finally assumes shape under these new conditions and comes at the light. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first of these phenomenons is the Neuentdeckung, the outrageous renaissance of the state in connection with a type Renationalisierung of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Indeed the crisis means a decline of the bank - and finance-institutions which narrow connections possess to the foreign countries and administer an immense quantity of the fortunes of private house-holds, that lives in one single state, at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This means an immediate political problem for the governments: namely like it itself opposite the concerned families too restrained which represent also a vast voter-mass is valid. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The crisis appears therefore economically globally, politically against it she/it is almost purely national. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The political internationalism seems gotten at itself into the offside so to be and to have lost his/its speech-right: The plausible proof for this has been given by the EC, which knows to find no common way on the basis of her/its/their division into different national and international conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Therefore, all now reckon with the intervention of the own state; rescue-plans, new rules, and V. A. distribution of support-funds: Since the crisis became more and more seriously, the USA are to be escaped merely in the economic layer without foreign help. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And beside the methods, they possess in addition also the legitimation to use these: consequently two not to überwertende prerequisites? under certain circumstances?, will be able to fall back no international organization and no market in similar manner on which normally probably. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Besides, that new emphasis, that is put on the state-national element, is in perfect unison with the ever bigger meaning, that is brought sector in connection in the economy with one on the narrowest relation recently,: the Territorialität. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It is exactly now paradoxical manner as we were so confident from it however to have entered a connected total-empire long ago, into an empire of the always varied technologies, the immaterial, that we must determine all at once, as our future will depend on the essentially material things however more and more: Water, harvest and oil. </seg>
<seg id="16"> These can admittedly be transported all of a place at the other of the world certain, is however nevertheless connected on most outer with a narrowly altered piece of earth? a territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore, the one, that owns such a territory, is with respect to another, that in a harvest-unproductive, water-draws lots or from Ölvorkommen woos area lives, in the advantage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I now come to the second newness, that presupposes a short in-thrust however. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Whoever says territory, who government, who politics says also Leadership with it. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In this sense, the finance-crisis seems to generate two convergent phenomenons. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the one hand the knowledge is there respectable Leaderships, therefore the need after somebody, that knows, about the necessity as one regulates the things. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On the other side, a wave of the indignation now insists over the existing leaderships, V. A. those of the economics, which have turned out as inadequate and full shadow-zones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> To it, a deep enough finally comes and in certain sense even worrying aspect: A trust-loss, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of the distance, that turn altogether towards a whole class of managers of the western countries. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It seems to itself the conviction so to clear the way under big sharings of the population that not it first the actions of the social elite but already her/its/their idea-world, her/its/their Way of Life, her/its/their culture in the widest sense of the word, is, whose salary itself the majority as more and more strangely and come over represents. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The demand after Leadership nurtures one branched, however mighty movement of the Entmachtung of the leading class and the conventional political establishment therefore underground. This manifestiert itself in unforeseen " revolts " of the voters and in the sudden reversal of the collective nature-condition of the last time: beginning with the ascent of the conservative in Austria and Bavaria, over the breakdown of the Labour-Partei in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American deputy against Bush and maybe also the victory of the rights plays a role in Italy here. </seg>
<seg id="26"> One wins the impression, as has the old elite, her/its/their parties, her/its/their programs, but also her/its/their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say her/its/their format, more and more understanding-problems and therefore less representative value respecting his, what goes on in the low social layers of the west nowadays and still reinforces from the finance-crisis and until is driven to the Überdimensionalität. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Countenance's all his would simply be it exaggerated to speak of a " rebellion of the masses ". </seg>
<seg id="28"> It certainly is not meanwhile to hold the eyes far however frankly. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The historic cinemas close on the basis of the favored Multiplexkinos. </seg>
<seg id="3"> " A city without cinema-halls is a blind city, like a face without eyes ". </seg>
<seg id="4"> This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes something in the big urbane centers of Italy, and also in the provinces, with effect momentarily happens. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The process of the Ausgrenzung of the cinemas, that began with the birth of the big multi-hall-complexes in the periphery, means the death for the in-hall-cinema in the center for the long term. A process, that appears not only inevitably and irrevocably, but also the trains of a cultural crime carries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Usually historic places are concerned full of memories, " it is to be lost like a friend, with which one has put back a piece of street full of emotions, according to the director of the film " Nuovo Cinema Paradiso ", that brought in him/it the Oskar and the big price of Cannes 20 years ago. It is about the history of a suburb-cinema and his nostalgia, which consist of it, probably to live in one for always lost cinema-world. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The numbers, which the Anec, the central trade-association delivers, clearly speaks one language: has had to lock the immense quantity of 316 traditional cinemas into the last five years; this mine paid the cinemas to the biggest part in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> To that at the most strongly effected region, the Emilia-Romagnas belong with 82 lost cinemas, followed from the Tuscany with 44 and the Lombardei with 41. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This testifies to it, that the Hauptschuldigens are the Multiplexkinos, because exactly these three regions, in which the biggest number of these modern cinemas was registered, are it: with 195 in the last 5 years, the Lombardei quotes the cunnings, 81 are it as well as in the Tuscany also as in the Emilia-Romagna. </seg>
<seg id="10"> " The business has developed " in an irrational manner, according to Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, " it is admittedly useful, that also new structures emerge, however at first position the already existing the receipt stands, then a hall locks into the city, all his/its patrons are not ready instead of looking the old for a Multiplexkino in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And here, the lacking budget still remains outer eight for the back of the trade-association: the indebtedness charted by the state amounts to 10 millions approximately Euro. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a disgrace of the ethical-moral point of view that the government doesn't heed the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In order to get the sector would be between 16 and 18 millions Euro in the year of needs ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has decided on the basis of the fears around the old cinema-halls, is interesting to protect these through an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is about the first agreement of this type in Italy, that aims at it, to protect the traditional cinemas and to support, and this as well as in the historic center, as also in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Under the foreseen measures, also fiscal Bevorteilungens are for the cinema-operators as well as advantages for the public respecting that of local traffic: it will be allowed to drive into the traffic-limited areas of the center and to park to more favorable park-dues furthermore. </seg>
<seg id="16"> " It is a pleasant initiative ", according to Giuseppe Tornatore, " I hopes, that other cities will affiliate our example and draft in addition as well new concepts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Certain however requires also a better we audio - and video-production, to be able to organize about something against the superpower of the Multiplexsäle, because the public is finally from today selective. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the shutdown of the " Supercinema " of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point, that brought me to it, that " to establish Nuovo cinema Paradiso ", even if I had already toyed since 10 years with the idea. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For 25 years, I have lived in Rome; if I pass by at the Rialto or at the Quirinale in the via of Nazionale, there, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I rotate to the side in order to have to see not the dust-covered posters. </seg>

<seg id="13"> He/it prosecuted on it into the vice-secretary of the Interior Marco Minniti, that he/it accused, to have invented everything for political-strategic reasons. The judges explain in the context with the warrant of today morning however that the Piromalli-Clan had even dared to apply for an alteration of the A3-Projektes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From an Abhöraktion in the context with the examinations to the case Dal Torrione, the willingness has appeared to come towards the wishes of an entrepreneur that a representative of the big group is about the Piromalli as is known ? wodurch the measures of the public administration identically with the interests this clan became ". </seg>

<seg id="1"> If the energy originates from from the waves, the big accumulate suddenly </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is a not drying up money-source which covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now seems this, to comprehend the big energy-companies of the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Waves, currents and tideses are now the new renewable sources of energy on them/her/it all looks, and also to occupy seeks, approximately giants like Chevron. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The possibility to win energy from the movements of the sea has already been moved for 70 years in consideration and has been examined; not by chance intensified itself these studies since the first petroleum-crisis considerably. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the price of the oil broke in about 1980, one gass the idea of the Meeresenergie, now however the environment-organizations and the climbed Ölpreis press for new impulses in this sector. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world-wide energy needs of the energies generated through the ocean-waves could be covered. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This would equal the double of that through nuclear power plants of produced energy momentarily. </seg>
<seg id="8"> To it, the currents and tideses would furthermore still come. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Giants with the attack. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The first company, that now favors the Meeresenergie, is Enersis, that has signed a contract in the year 2005 to the erection of a power plant in the north of Portugal. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As this message was published it seemed to be about a revolutionary step. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Two years later, it is now companies from the traditional energy-industry, that puts energy-extraction on the navy, more and more. </seg>
<seg id="13"> " Chevron examines these technologies "? according to the speaker a the US-American giant of known business in the embankment Street journal? and weigh up the possibility to work together " with us. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is about the procurement of an admission of the American energy-commission, that is necessary, on this occasion in order to start a project before the coast of Alaska. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This is a not too underestimating sign, V. A. if one considers, that oil is still promoted exactly in Alaska through the USA and President Bush put down the plans first for new Bohrungen in walk recently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Besides Chevron, also the companies Verdant power Inc. are power from New Jersey, that invests into the new industry, from New York and Ocean; is not known also the details, so observers speak of a climbing interest however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Still improvement-worthy technologies. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Experts still speak themselves of one in the departure deciding technology, this not finally, since the last doubts of sides of the environmentalists are not yet clarified. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Until now, projects are like that in Portugal and also Scotland of rather small dimension and seems no to cause seriously to taking ecological problems. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In order to produce however energy in big standard, it needs technologies with much bigger influence on the environment. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There are different possibilities: Ocean power for example uses a system of together interconnected buoys. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The thrust of the waves, which the buoys on and moves down, is changed within the swimmers over pistons and cylinders in hydraulic pressure. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This drives a turbine, which drives a generator on the other hand. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The stream is sent to it over underwater-managements to the coast. </seg>
<seg id="25"> So far, there is four schemed enclosures of this type, which only wait for the state authorization. A part of the won energy could serve also for military facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Verdant power already produces energy for a merchandise-department store and a park-bib with the help of submarine turbines in the east River of New York meanwhile. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The water-movements during the tideses drives the turbines, which eat the generator through the emerging rotation. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Loudly Verdant waits already to use a long snake of possible clients on the necessary Autorisierungens about these sources of energy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> First the waves, then the tideses. </seg>
<seg id="30"> A particular interest deserved according to the institute for stream-extraction-research momentarily the Potenzial, which is in the tideses. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Albeit it is also about an irregular phenomenon, the tideses are vorhersagbars as wind-currents, the sun-no-radiation and also the waves, however better and therefore a more trustworthy stream-source. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Exactly the tides-energy is it, which federal states like New York, Maine and Alaska as well as wide coastal-states to it already to invest 7,5 million dollars in the year 2008 brought? is already planned for 2009 up to 35 millions. </seg>
