You are, about what you inform over yourself 
Google can claim with good cause on the occasion of her tenth birthday: in the bags of the people, she can be found just the same as over her heads in the sky: She knows where the people have spent her vacation to which specialists they go and what she moves. 
And thus still not enough, according to the Eric Schmidt, one of the managing directors of Google. 
In the direction of the sceptics who are bothered by Orwell's horror visions he has lined up: These would become the essential precisely the overlook web 2.0. 
Financial Times recently meant Schmidt with this, it is the primary objective of Google to collect still more personal data over the users and to come closer to the original target of the company so according to which it wants "to organize all information of this world" in an interview. 
Schmidt explained, the information is still Google after ten years world changing work only at the beginning collect. 
Asked after the status Quo within five years thought for Schmidt: he wished Google were able as "what I shall do tomorrow"?, questions ? or "really which job matches" me software programs are not able yet, though, since they wouldn't know over the users enough to answer. 
Clear that in the course of their Internet enquiries the search strings would be registered as well as also the IP-addresses not all Internet user was searched by which out and the frequented sides is about this in this. 
For example the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago permits the visitor to store its own search course and to go back to it later so that the hits can be generated later much more precisely and the so-called "Recommendations" with which the system recommends custom-made products and services due to the earlier preferences are also based on the same logic. 
The users wonder, though, what happens in the case of a data misuse, "if one has a look what I do", show some gottenly whether the Google data monopoly. 
In most cases it is the feelings of guilt or the fear of punishment, the striving for liberty or the on-desire against the power which at many rejection open pushes for Internet users, however, rather represented these of the company, potential power, which seems frightening and less. 
It is a proved fact that the search strings are not only stored but also passed on to third parties in the cause case, though and in these law cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user. 
Recently, a prime example for this was the procedure against pedophilia in Brazil in the course of which Google presented the Brazilian government information which was collected named "Orkut" and also made an identification of the pedophilias possible of the community site. 
However, users worried for personal rights still could breathe a sigh of relief in May when EFF went to court Google together with the civil right organization successfully against the FBI: also Google cannot be in future forced therefore with any point of the constitution information to hand FBI over to it on a secret enquiry. 
The Federal Government has obtained the handing out of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search strings successfully (was, though the list of the individual users or its web and search string list withheld from it for two months retrospectively) under reference to the protection of children and young people law passed years ago, though. 
So Googles image remains controversial: Those which reluctantly return their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and private life by the use of the Google services scourge the enterprise with the indignation due to the companies appearing conservatively. 
The American "Geek culture" which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, is the next generation of the "cool businessmen" in them unlike Microsoft, this thanks to Windows market leaders, sees meanwhile even if both fight for the same aim. 
It is a possible reason for it that Google doesn't demand any identification codes from its users unlike Microsoft and provides with its services free of charge so that a source code updated more openly, permanently and program package seem than the official methods of the software giant to be far more attractive, more youthful and cooler. 
On the other hand the Geeks are the problematic relationship of the personal right and this Internet getting it razor-sharp -- a relationship, this particularly within the last years thanks to the concept, has moved "web 2.0" into the center. 
Traces leave a message saying deliberately it is for web 2.0 " namely all about nothing else than around collaboration, speak, the users and the available communication channels are of use and the main thing remains the same namely even if the extents are different individually at this " to show oneself public. 
An average teenager can manage his image for services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm on several community portals -- of Facebook about Xanga this can by means of others -- with connect, and at the same time into one each other can finally backtracing system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm tie all this. Furthermore they can lead Blogs, which represent the newest photo galleries automatically which are on Flickr or Picasa geostet. 
And a number of broader exemplary cases proves: When looking at the party photos of the last night the friend finds out soon with whom he her unfaithful friend has amused or the employee will dismiss himself because his annoyance over the corporate management makes only too honest in his Blog, one is certain: The concept "privacy" was interpreted completely newly meanwhile. 
Who leads an online life is what he surrenders of himself, one formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth as approximately could. 
And who tries to keep secret or to avoid even the Google monopoly a little is welcome to do this, such as with Scroogle, deliberately any traces not leaves to a tool which although accesses the search engine of Google, though. 
No few people deliberately don't on community sides register the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS-Feeds, however, also have themselves so that they aren't traceable avoided with alternative versions which are bound and therefore don't generate the best possible profile of the user either to no gigantic server parks. 
The public opinion waits spellboundly for it meanwhile until Google shows its real character. 
With its present value of USD 156 bn Microsoft the enterprise even in front of IBM (USD 140 bn), Intel (USD 124 bn) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 bn), the advertising spaces of AdWords, lies/the revenue of the advertising agencies threatens AdSense and not only this one prepares always faster to established services others software, but also developers headache. 
Critical observers also find the worrying counterpoles, though: So approximately the central management of a group has rejected a protest of the employees completely after the charges of the company nursery school were doubled, in addition, the employee meant the management, repeated catering is too costly. On the other hand, however, all this appears virtually mild, that Google in the year 2006 went even into the knees and agreed with an agreement in front of the Chinese government after which all regime critical hits or those which violate the good taste would be filtered out. 
The internal regulation of the group is, that no new service in advance is advertised but first if this is already available, too. The events of the next months and years could nevertheless turn something up strongly again: Reconciles mine, Googles book and Magazinscan or storage project accepts extents meanwhile while, that the enterprise must to itself explain court of justice with the colonel soon, others are rather worried so because of the Systems "Health" which makes the construction of a complete health profile possible using results, doctors and problems. 
Approximately "Scroogled" -- and the fact that Google builds up a genetic database already supplies to the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors with the substance, the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes a future in the best Orwell's manner in which a man alarmingly gets approaching cash thanks to data obtained from Google.
