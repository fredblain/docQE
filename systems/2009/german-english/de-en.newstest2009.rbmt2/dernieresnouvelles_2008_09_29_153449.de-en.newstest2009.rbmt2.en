Illhäusern ... finite 
After a long lean period Illhäusern is on a run of success on the field finally again. 
Himself without a great effort erspielten and the yellow black managed to convert one of this and to win the game so numerous scoring chances. 
The speed of this meeting with which the attackers had trouble, their knowledge to point, wasn't very high. 
After a first attack of the guest captain Kauffmann whose far shot only just passed by the angle shot Illhäusern should dominate the game with no trouble at all and only Fonderflick turned out well alternately with a far shot, then brain with a high passport and Romain with one with the toe, the defense Denmark to challenge. 
The opposing team blocked in the country middle and let through only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm. 
Should be decisively the beginning of the second half at first two scoring chances and the same won by Riahi and temporal after those with the first gate for the Illhäuser by Marais which exactly stood correctly around again this one, into a first test of Diebold fended off been assume a ball had. 
But the illhäusische goal scorer should be able to not enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent on the bank about twelve minutes later, through what his team comrades had numerically to play on inferiorly. 
However, Denmark didn't know how to make use of it and didn't pit any great problems against an illhaeusischen eleven which only a little retired around its defense to 'increase' unless within the very last seconds of the game in which the ball passed by the slat after a great mess very near.
