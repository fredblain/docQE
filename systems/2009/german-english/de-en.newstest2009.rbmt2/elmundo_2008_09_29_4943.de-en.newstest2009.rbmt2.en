Microsoft on the search for a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
>> Auf der `Emerging Technology Conference', veranstalte von MIT, hat Microsoft den Fortschritt des neuen Bilderkennungssystems und der Mensch-Interaktion vorgestellt, ein Wesen der künstlichen Intelligenz ohne viel Intelligenz, welches jedoch fähig ist, einige primitive Aufgaben zu erledigen, wie zum Beispiel ein Taxi bestellen (oder im Fall von Microsoft ist das ein Routenplaner, um sich auf dem Campus des Unternehmens zu bewegen). The system takes what it hears during the conversation into account. 
Thanks to a camera and a form and Gesichterkennungssystem this 'Rezeptionistin' can recognize how many persons are in the room who they are and remember even itself it can as they were dressed listened and the keywords conversation get on it. 
It also can put in order the persons present after the conversations into the groups. 
In the presentation video 'the Rezeptionistin' notices a third person but it understands that this person isn't accompanying to the group which holds its conversation and that no company employee is either. 
She enquires whether the person here wants to pay a visit to somebody and answers that he will listen soon. 
Everything without the blue screenshot 
Impressive 
This is surely the future. 
The enterprise has better things now for example on the next version of her operating system Windows it can concentrate on. 
One talked very superficially about the strategy change of Microsoft this week. 
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many tied programs. 
Steve Ballmer stated that, five times, she would then, if the computers were equipped with the most necessary one instead of filling her with the commercial garbage, work faster. Yes, Steven, this only becomes man the some for be. 
Everything is only an observation if one considers that Microsoft caused function and 'Extras' one or others in Windows versions. 
The change of direction is worthwhile 
Microsoft is right, this the operating system loses gradually meaning exactly like the software. 
As Google chrome in the net appeared, was a part of the theory this that it is the first step of Google to compete with Windows. 
Many skillfully pointed out that the browser isn't an operating system. 
The operating system as an indispensable part will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work at the same time. 
The operating system fulfills the function which can be compared with the function of his wife or his husband if it is all about to inform his mother-in-law about something. 
This is correct. 
The system will never disappear but one must think not when an absolute one but as a relative truth of his 'death'. 
What this week told Ballmer is the confirmation of this idea. 
The people give the operating system less attention more, for this the Web browser every time. 
It becomes the computer to execute the Explorer or chrome and every day spend we around the Firefox, started only, more time at the surfing than in the surroundings of the 'windows'. 
What does the half serve applications in the computer more availably for? 
Some are more 
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than sight. 
Lighten less complicatedly, not exaggerated so. 
More consists the interest in integrating its online services which then finally can become the alternative to Google of Microsoft. 
In the reality they need this without doubt. I bring a small example of it. 
I have the photo of this place in Redmond, made in one of the relaxation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. 
Refreshment drinks machine is a shield on this fastens: 'Your search. Our future '. It prints a request to use tool of one's own for online search. 
In the year 2006 an independent study added to the end that this one was of use the 66% for employees at Microsoft, Google for the enquiries in the net. 
The new version of the Windows mobile 7 in this by the way also was confirmed last week that delay has turned out. 
She doesn't become beginning but appear at the end of 2009, sooner even 2010. 
Microsoft seeks the possibility, Windows 7 and Windows mobile 7 on bring to the marks at the same time. 
The telephone changes into a computer every day. 
The android and the iPhon already are on the market but the other delay will cost money.
