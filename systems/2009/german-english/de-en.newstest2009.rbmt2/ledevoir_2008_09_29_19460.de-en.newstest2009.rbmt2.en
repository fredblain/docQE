Letters, a dishonored country 
It was Mr Vic Toews, all over-'justice' secretary (which one irony) in the high quality German white wine Harper which permitted itself to say over Louise Arbour last summer she is a 'disgrace' for Canada. 
This woman himself who has waged a fight for the justice not wanting to end and all our admiration deserves to cover with ignominy so says just as much about the persons, like around the prime minister about Stephen Parker. 
We have to do it here with a government which hasn't fetched their compatriot captured in the concentration camp Guantanamo as the only one home from all the countries concerned. 
A government which doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things which he is accused of happened. 
The only government which breaks its word and lets a child soldier eke out a miserable existence under inhuman conditions despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva convention. 
This one condescends for a justice parody to assess the fault of the defendant the only ones. 
We call each other, that in memory UNICEF, Amnesty International and the union of the Canadian advocates of it plead primarily to fetch Omar Khadr home so that he gets a just process in Canada. 
Exactly this government also locks the eyes before the torture: It interests little that a young adult surely will be broken for the pain spiritually after so many years for ever. 
We aren't still conscious of this one but we just experience an insidious curtailment of our rights, our liberty and our 'democracy', this word which permanently carries Harper like a flag in front of self here and which sounds so meaningless from his mouth, here. 
So it has come the time at which there are no more morals: One may completely maltreat, torment and lock in a Canadian citizen arbitrarily after discretion of a head of the government, to this day, which only is supported by the minority (he may completely belong ... with the minority) after October 14th. 
Many voters think to find their well-being at a party which preaches virtue, law and order. But they don't see that this government has renounced what agreed on the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The disgrace, Mr Toews, lies in this breakaway and nowhere differently.
