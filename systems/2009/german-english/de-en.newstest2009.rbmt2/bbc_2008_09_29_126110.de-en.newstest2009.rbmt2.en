It was reported to a court the abuse lasting for years by her stepfather has been the reason that a woman has killed herself. 
Michael Trerise, 57 from Stithians, Cornwall, got a prison sentence of six years after it had confessed eight cases of a sexual abuse. 
The punishing court of justice in Truro learned that was it regularly tied up Stephanie Randle its stepdaughter as it between five and seven years as. 
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for its death." 
The court learned that Mrs Randle killed herself in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1st, 2007 in the age of 34. 
When it lived as a child in Coventry Trerise had tied them up and bandaged its eyes before it carried out sexual actions while its mother was gone to work in a restaurant. 
Trerise and its wife sought a divorce into the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall. 
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth. 
The court learned, however, that part of their time which had been caused to her two times in the week worked in an honorary capacity for the National trust, was pursued by the abuse Mrs Randle, uniting the great. 
Public prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends would have said that Mrs Randle who had been one eager a surfer and cyclist has been "emotionally dead" and would have "given up their life" since 2006 
Her right father found Terrance Randle her deadly in her apartment in Plymouth in April 2007. 
It is, that she has killed herself assumed by himself has suffocated himself by means of a plastic bag. 
Mr Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter who wrote a confession letter which ended so: "I used to tie them up and to bandage her eyes." 
"I haven't forced her sexually. 
I feel responsible for her death." 
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely displeasing fetishist and for her victim it must have been frightening particularly first sift her was there. 
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim. 
The fact that it is very improbable that the matter would be ended in front of court if this hadn't done it worse is yet." 
He added: "I take note which consequences her deed had according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother on her daughter over the years. 
She would otherwise have obviously been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
