If the energy arises from the waves, the great ones suddenly accumulate 
It is a source of income not drying up, which covers more than 70% of the surface of the planet and the great seem this to energy companies of the world only now to understand. 
Waves, flows and tides are the new renewable energy sources on these everyone looks now and tries also to occupy for giants like Chevron approximately. 
The possibility of winning energy out of the movements of the sea is drawn and examined already for 70 years into consideration; these studies didn't intensify themselves considerably since the first earth oil crisis by chance. 
As the price of the oil at 1980 one broke in the idea of the sea energy gasify, the environmental organizations and the oil price increased are pressing for new impulses in this sector now, however. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London guesses that 15% of the worldwide energy requirement could be covered by the energies produced by the ocean waves. 
This would amount to the double of the energy produced by nuclear power stations at the moment. 
In addition, the flows and tides would there be in addition. 
Giants at the attack. 
The first company which backs the sea energy now is Enersis which has signed a contract for the erection of a power station in the north of Portugal in the year 2005. 
You published as this message seemed to be a revolutionary step. 
It is more and more companies from the traditional energy industry now two years later which put power generation on the navy. 
"Chevron examines these technologies"? so the spokesman of an enterprise known to the U.S. giant in the Wall Street Journal? and the possibility weighs up cooperating with us." 
It is all about the obtaining of an admittance of the American energy commission which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska. 
This is a sign to be not underestimated, V . . if one considers that are furthermore oil is extracted by the USA just in Alaska and president Bush recently got the plans going first for new drillings. 
The companies Verdant energy Inc. from New York and Ocean energy from New Jersey which invest in the new line of business also are besides Chevron; if the details aren't known either, then observers talk about an increasing interest anyway. 
Still improvement worthy technologies. 
Experts talk, about a technology still being in the departure this the last doubts not least, here aren't cleared on the part of the environmentalists yet. 
Till now projects like that one are in Portugal and also Scotland of a rather small dimension and seem ecological problems to be taken seriously no to cause. 
To produce energy in a great scale, however, it requires technologies greater influence on the environment far. 
There are different possibilities: Energy approximately uses a system of buoys connected to each other Ocean. 
The push of the waves, and which one becomes within the swimmers over pistons and top-hats into a hydraulic pressure, moved down, the buoys on changed. 
This drives a turbine which in turn operates a generator. 
The current is sent to the coast on this over sub-water pipes. 
Up till now there is four planned plant of this type, which only wait for the state approval. A part of the won energy could serve also for military facilities. 
Meanwhile, Verdant energy already produces energy for a goods department store and a park bib with the help of submarine turbines in the East River of New York. 
The water movements during the tides drives the turbines, which eats the generator by the arising rotation. 
According to the Verdant a long snake already services the necessary authorizations from possible clients to use these energy sources. 
First the waves, then the tides. 
A special interest is earning the potential presently which is in the tides according to the institute for current extraction research. 
Although it also is an irregular phenomenon the tides are predictable a more trustworthy current source better as wind flows, the solar radiation and also the waves, and therefore anyway. 
It is definitely the tides energy which federal states like New York, Main and Alaska as well as further coastal states got to invest already 7.5 million dollars in the year 2008? for 2009 up to 35 millions are already planned.
