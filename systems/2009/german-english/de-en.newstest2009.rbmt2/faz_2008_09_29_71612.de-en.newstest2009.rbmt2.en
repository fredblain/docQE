Hopes of D체sseldorf rest on Frankfurt 
Doesn't there be a lack of great words in the letter of the WestLB executive board to the employees of the house. 
It is said in the letter become known on Monday "the central capital market house of the savings bank finance group" can be made a bringing units of the financial institution of D체sseldorf together with the Frankfurt deca-bank. 
The WestLB would bring in a "competence block" with a lasting earning power to such a business. 
And such a connection can be the decisive annoyance in the country banking sector to further groupings at all. 
Then it gets if an executive board wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult time. 
Because the shattered WestLB still is under an enormous pressure. 
Only on the part of the EU commission but also by the Federal Institute for financial service supervision which has only recently made clear to the Nordrhein Westphalian Land government the time is not pressing to find a future solution. 
From a connection taken like always between the deca-bank which savings bank customers know because of their investment funds and the WestLB the talk is also on Frankfurt side already for some time, though. 
Approximately the Helaba has let deca-bank boss know Franz Waas at the end of August on the presentation of the half dates in a fusion of the house at the Mainz secondary road with a regional bank or, the WestLB, it doesn't see meaning. 
But the administrative board has this one deca-, this one are shared by the regional banks and the savings bank associations, engage the executive board to hold conversations about common business activities with the WestLB. 
It could be all about the capital market business or parts of it. 
It has the conversations admittedly, is so called at the financial center, started just. 
For the first time, the talk isn't from the deca-bank which counts Frankfurt as one of the more important employers with its 3000 employees at the financial center if it is all about consolidation in the savings bank sector. 
In 2003 it looked for a moment for a long time as if the deca-bank can merge with the regional bank Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba. 
This three federation turned, however, into nothing. 
The plans had hardly got public, the Hessian Land government voiced against a participation of the Helaba in it. 
The two other houses not found thereupon to each other either. 
The regional bank Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank Baden-Wurttemberg in Stuttgart. 
But there have been intellectual games about a connection of the deca-bank with regional banks again and again. 
G체nther Merl, chairman of the executive board the Helaba, had voiced against experimental games about a joining with his house last, though. 
Independently of it, the knowledge of maturing seems, however, that a moving the different houses of the sector under public law closer together is necessary. 
After the regional election is in Bavaria over now, a connection of the BayernLB with the regional bank Baden-Wurttemberg details back could first. 
This isn't a piece of good news for the Helaba absolutely. 
If the pressure should increase to further fusions, the partners go out her after and after for this. 
It would be junior partner in the south only more, although, till now, they got far better through the financial crisis as the houses has in Munich and Stuttgart. 
The west in turn this one has LB for savings banks and bolts unite giro association Hesse Thuringia at the beginning of the year which is involved in the Helaba with 85 per cent pushed forward a join with. 
Had if need be the north LB left. 
However, such geostrategischen considerations are only this side. 
It is on the other one all about the question how the different business models of the individual houses match each other. 
Merl said in June, till now, the decisive question with which business model the Zukunftf채higkeit of the regional banks shall be guaranteed hadn't been answered by the German savings banks and giro association. 
At the end a taking apart also could the west LB which isn't wished there of course, though be. 
So the talk also is in the letter of this executive board there, then, in any case a "complete solution" for the house is striven for. 
Has units brought with the deca-bank under a hat, will let himself be seen still join like this with this single.
