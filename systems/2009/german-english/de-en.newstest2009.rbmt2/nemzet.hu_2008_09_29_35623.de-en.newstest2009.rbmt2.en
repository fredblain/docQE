Press review of the German-speaking room 
The right store is intact, only the voters got more self-confident within the store, "the mirror" comments on the weak performance of CSU in Bavaria so.

The mirror (spiegel.de) 
In the online issue of the German news magazine established on the left Franz Walter analyzes the reasons of the dramatic defeat of CSU in his article "Bavaria's revolution eradicates its fathers". 
In opinion of the renowned political scientist the erosion of CSU already started before for a long time the sad Beckstein-Huber duo assumed its offices. 
The Christian Socials have replaced Bavaria over decades, the modern citizens are just turning away from them now. 
The epoch break is a problem of the Christdemokratie, as also for Angela Merkel, at the same time. 
The disaster of CSU quite as a surprise didn't come but on Sunday what already stood out rather exactly ten years ago, though has come to an end a little: the undoubted hegemony of an official party 
Ten years ago 1998 then already CSU lands at 47.7 per cent and fell thus for the first time for the fifties under the fifty per cent brand 
This recurred at the parliamentary elections in 2005 three years ago that is still in the much quoted Stoiber era. 
The modernization operated by CSU in the federal state consistently has in the end eradicated its own mothers and fathers. 
Sociologists had forecast this already 40 years ago, however, miscalculated it in the speed considerably. But couldn't remain the secularization, the education successes, the draw without consequences from east and North German to the prospering regions of Bavaria on the faithfulness of the CSU voters. 
Modernization is always accompanied by Options increase. And this has political consequences. 
The right store is intact, only the voters within the store got more critical and more self-willed. 
It is striking that within the last weeks the classic citizen groups said the biggest distance virtually to CSU: the free professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voter with abitur like degree. 
The support of CSU sank on even under 40 per cent here.

SPÖ boss Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to want to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that a cooperation of both parties is very probably possible, this is already the case in some federal states and in the social partnership. 
The question whether it could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the present ÖVP boss as a vice-chancellor, then left Faymann open. 
As he said, the voters would have voted the bowl Molterer course out. 
A repetition of this direction would be out of the question. 
Molterer has reacted to red offers carefully meanwhile. 
He thought the cooperation cannot go fertile if Faymann tries to interfere in internal requests of the ÖVP. 
At present, whether its party goes into opposition or in the coalition is completely open and these questions should be discussed ÖVP internally. 
BZÖ boss Jörg Haider showed himself straight in all directions. 
So Haider is " we to take on ready, government responsibility ", to prevent around red black.
