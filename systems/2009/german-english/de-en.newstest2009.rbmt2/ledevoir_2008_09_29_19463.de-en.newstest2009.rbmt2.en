Charest backs the north 
The prime minister doesn't exclude still to start elections before the end of the year. 
Yesterday, as soon as the general meeting of the liberal party came to an end, Jean Charest went after Jean talon in Quebec where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (the Left) tries to be elected in today's partial choice. 
'Moving the course of our last great limit in the north': This is the long-term aim which introduced Jean Charest with visual means during the general meeting of the liberal party of Quebec in Levis yesterday in which he completely followed the guidelines. 
During his lecture a kind of picture mill was projected behind him. 
Spectacular pictures of hydroelectric power stations, mines of Quebec in 'Google Maps' looked at, maps etc., turned on three gigantic screens. 
Large means like during the legislative period. 
The prime minister refused opposite the press by the way to rule out that he will hold the elections this fall even if he indicated that his appointment book is very full. 
The 'plan the north' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the prime minister has allegedly for Quebec, namely that one of a 'new working area', this agreement with France regarding workers, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario provides. 
Although it was frequently mentioned in the speeches of the prime minister in the last time, the opening of the north, the northern area on the 49 sten degree of latitude, had never been topic of a presentation. 
The prime minister confined himself to it, however, why explain oneself the north 'a jewel with an enormous potential' be, no date, no investment sums or exact priorities for the coming projects, however, called. 
At the most some views of on what more could be worked: Primarily at the water energy on the woods but special at the mining sector favored by the growth of the fast-developing nations and the renewal of the public infrastructures. 
According to the enumeration Mr Charests the north 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, Titan and even diamonds' has. 
Area is in our proximity, is in Quebec twice as big as France this '. 
How it isn't only in our proximity, it is in us ', he emphasized, around clear to show that he tries to put a national founder dream into effect? 
He emphasized Quebec has grown very much by its connection with the north: the street to the gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James bay. 
'It belongs to us', it is our future, he added after he had had a theatrical break to look at the gigantic card behind himself. 
The prime minister of the press opposite explained the north, 70% of the area of Quebec, surrounds a part of Labrador which Quebec always called in. 
'This is a traditional attitude which all governments followed up. 
There is a border at which hasn't there been any agreement for very long time if the opportunity offers itself I will take this attitude in the name of the government again ', he explained himself. 
In addition, he declared 'we must reconsider our vision newly of the north' with the climate change and talked about the northwest arcade which will be passable due to the thaw the whole year. 
The prime minister thinks against this new geopolitical background that it is a duty virtually to occupy this area. 
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would handle them very cautiously and that they would profit from this project the boys primarily. 
Two former secretaries of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pekistischer representatives of Ungava) have already started consultations among about thirty communities. 
A secretary committee escorted of Benoît Pelletier in which Julie Boulet (transportation and mineral resources) takes an important position has taken the work. 
The prime minister doesn't exclude a great meeting one a common vision will itself create, ' not unconditional a peak ', but an opportunity, at which ' '. 
The development of the north will take place as for the rest in agreement with the principles of the sustainable development. 
he promised the plan the north will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally harmless'. 
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it is a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers which were in the office in front of him. 
'How the liberal ones which were in the office in front of us do we have changed to convert the challenges to new growth and Entwicklungschanchen? 
This was by the way one of the topics of the weekend which was opened by Jean Lesage with a great cocktail party for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the take-over of the party leaders on Friday raised again and again. 
One of the adopted decisions intends to rename the power station of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout dam. 
From Godbout which has created Hydro-Quebec about Lesage which has reached the quiet revolution and the nationalization of the water electricity to Bourassa this one has made the James bay, knew our party always ' to determine ', Jean Charest declared, the future. 
It referred to a different one, this time conservative plan cover, and to be more precise to the program ' Roads to The North ' of John Diefenbaker, prime minister of 1957 to 1963., opposite the press 
With respect to the project water-power dam Eastmain1a-Ruper which is whose putting into operation for provided in 2012 Mr Charest emphasizes. 
'This remains under us but I intend to take part', he trusted his party members on what caused approval storms with those. 
The prime minister who has that 2008 and surely either 2009 wouldn't become elections geben said in April has the possibility of holding an election this fall, what, for it indeed from the law possibly is, not excluded yet. 
He emphasizes primarily because of a mission of the community advice in China and a peak between Quebec and New York that his appointment book is, however, full. 
The general meeting of the weekend provided the liberal party leader with a platform from nationalistic plans primarily from 'aims concerning the constitution' which were accepted straight away: The PLQ demands quite particularly the recognition of the unusual feature 'of Quebec' in the constitution. 
She also would want that Quebec appoints members of the advice of the Canadian broadcast and telecommunications and that these have a veto regarding the decisions made in Quebec. 
On the part of the opposition the guidelines of the plan the north were taken with scepticism. 
The boss the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has the north you got back the politics got Quebec out again, has this one established the government Landry 2001 for the development. 
The liberal government has done without according to her when it came to the power in 2003 using these. 
Today, if it had done it, we 'would' already be much further Mrs Marois on the side of her candidate judged in Jean talon (where the choice takes place today) Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ has declared in favor of supporting the acceptance of a plan the north by the government. 
'But' what we want is that this becomes not only a great performance the party leader declared Sébastien Proulx into representation for Mario Dumont who comes back today from the vacation.
