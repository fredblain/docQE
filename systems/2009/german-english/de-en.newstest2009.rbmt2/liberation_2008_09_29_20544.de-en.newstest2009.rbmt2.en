On the first debate of the two candidates for the White House of the Friday a further one followed John McCain or Barack Obama to find out who resulted as a winner from it. 
As expected the QGs announced for the choice both the republican and the democrats their own victory in this TV duel which should be pursued by a third of the American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen guesses that John McCains performance wasn't 'brilliant' enough although quite considerable to make it possible for him still to stop his fall in the choice surveys five weeks before the presidential elections. 
The Gallup institute by which an opinion poll was published on Saturday which lies according to Obama with five points in front (49% to 44% for Mccain) thinks that the democrat makes the better figure obviously. 
With the still undecided voters, that is the ones it depends on now, Obama resulted with 39% as a winner from the surveys while according to a CBS survey 25% of them are considering Mccain a winner. 
Obama should lead is expected with the good performance, the one of its fellow applicant Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with its rival Sarah Palin, on Thursday, his can confirm 
'It would be a fault to underestimate her. 
She has good instincts ', this weekend Bill Clinton warned, however. 
The seventy-year-old Mccain didn't stop moving his unquestionable experience in the field of the foreign policy to the foreground and underlining the 'naivety' of his opponent quite considerably regarding these questions which formed the center of this first TV duel. 
Senator Obama doesn't seem he emphasized several times to understand ', that ... '. 
In addition, he assured 'I don't think that senator Obama has the necessary experience and the required knowledge to become a president'. 
A target is, lectured to choice commercials this one since yesterday in the republican. 
Obama itself emphasized that it represents the future. 
He spoke shortly and precisely without having anybody bring himself from the setting. 
He moved his ability to the foreground to take good decisions and to replace the picture which has the world of the United States. 
Mccain still hasn't understood, it was to have accused of to Obama in the republican, however, spare, on the other hand, a democratic choice commercial put this weekend grasped not the complete extent of the crisis which weighs heavily on the 'American of the street' '. 
During the 90 minutes John McCain had to tell the debate a lot of things over me ', but nothing over you ', Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had assembled on the occasion of a choice event in north Carolina in pouring rain. 
He mentioned not even the words 'middle classes' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis provides the Americans to Obama, this one for keep the most suitable even still to save the economy on the edge of the precipice, a clear advantage. 
The next week 'could' represent a decisive turning point, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday. 
The democratic representative cream Emanuel, a former member of the government Clinton, compared the 'good economic instincts' Obamas with these of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
For the democratic candidate the short-term crisis 'the degree verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy which has been converted by George Bush and supported by senator Mccain' has. 
After he had emphasized once more that he even would manage well to cut the taxes for 95% of the Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energetic independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies together with the introduction of a health insurance system for him would have a topmost priority. 
Mccain however wanted to build a plant to 2030 out of 45 nuclear power stations. 
The two candidates evaded the himself carefully the questions, on the plan for the rescue of the finance market over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) which was adopted by the convention last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
