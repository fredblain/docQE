Well rested Gebrselassie beats its world's record 
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia which has made the distance of 42.2 kilometers in some as 2 hours and 4 minutes has after it has broken its own record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and has become the first person shown again why some think it for the best long-distance runner of all times. 
With the victory at the flat course in 2:03:59 Gebrselassie has a previous result of 2:04:26 improves his by 27 seconds which it had reached in Berlin last year. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has his 26th world's record in its versatile career in which it at least reaches a World Cup title or has a world's record built up to the marathon on every stretch of a kilometer builds with that. 
Gebrselassie has left the Olympic marathon out that in Beijing the air pollution could make its asthma problems worse last month out of fear which, afterward, perhaps was exaggerated. 
He has applied for the competition in Berlin instead. 
In almost ideal conditions at sun and 9 degrees of the start and 13 degrees of the aim Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile. 
Since train runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed to long distances is the record time has fallen for marathon within the last 10 years by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo has won Costa over for Brazil in 1998 with the result 2:06:05 there in Berlin. 
After its victory on Sunday Gebrselassie has informed the press it would have had cramps two weeks ago in its calf and therefore couldn't exercise a week. 
Obviously he has come back refreshed after break and not rusted up. 
"I am so happy", he said to reporters. 
"Everything has run perfectly. 
I have resumed the training a week ago and, today, had still some doubts but at the end what everything super." 
It was criticized for this him particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia's rival from East Africa, that he excessively orchestrates his racing runs, avoids many world's best marathon stars generally, relies on the racing leaders too much as if this would be a train racing and puts world's records about the competition. 
But this criticism hardly harms the size Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner. 
Accompanied by four Kenyans Gebrselassie had reached the center of the way in 1:02:04 on Sunday. 
Furthermore two Elitel√§ufer from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have Gebrselassie challenges after the speed doers had gone off. 
Gebrselassie has a little more than three miles from the finish made its last beginning to part with Kwambai which has arrived as second in 2:05:36 and has improved its best time by almost 5 minutes with that. 
Kamathi became a third party in 2:07:48. 
Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakstan and now German have completed among women a considerable year by having shown the siebtschnellste result of all times with 2:19:19. 
The world's record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain. 
The 36 years old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London marathon in 2:24:14 last spring. 
She has the games in Beijing missed because of problems, these as a back injury, described were. She has, however, recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes. 
It has planned its run skillfully by a quartet let only ausreissen, overtook, however, after 30 kilometers her from Ethiopian and Kenyan runners. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2:21:31 while Helena Kiprop from Kenya as third parties in 2:25:01 arrived.
