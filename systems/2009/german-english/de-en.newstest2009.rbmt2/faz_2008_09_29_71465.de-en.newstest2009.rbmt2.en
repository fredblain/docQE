Sleepless nights for creditors the Hypo real Estate 
The German bank system is relatively stable, Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück emphasized week only in this one formerly. 
How good, that the politician used the word "relative" and also einflocht, that the German banking sector isn't spared by the krisenhaften developments. 
Because this one has entered at the weekend now. 
This one in the DAX quoted Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo real Estate (HRE) gets a billion loan from a syndicate of German banks to protect himself from the turbulences on the markets. 
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday the credit helps amounted to up to 35 billions euro. 
The Hypo real Estate must pay interest on only the part which it also takes up. 
The money comes both of private banks as also under public law. 
Losses are background at the daughter Depfa. 
Extremely quickly, the Staatsfinanzierer had refinanced itself according to a newspaper report for long period projects for which it has awarded money, what is meanwhile no longer possible because of the distrust on the markets. 
In the first six months of 2008 the bar reserve of the bank had shrunk by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, the return on equity also had easily given way from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent. 
The regular yields and the net proceeds out of finance business had fallen to zero compared with the year-earlier period, the yields from ascriptions to demands and certain securities as well as from the dissolving of provisions in the credit transaction around more than sunk 70 per cent on 5 million euros. 
Only thanks to higher returns on refunds of after stored charging costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as from the refund of interest according to the Internal Revenue Code and from the Geschäftsbesorgung for group enterprises the yield minus had dropped. 
In the year 1990, formerly, Staatsfinanzierer had this one been out in its calculations after its privatization at first with commercial property loans which then had been hived off in the Aareal Bank. 
Because one earned too little in the classic state financing the Depfa then had increased in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint ventures of private investors and the state of dedicated (Private PUBLIC-Partnership, PPP) and international diversifizierrt. 
The Hypo real Estate must carry out deductions now on the value of the daughter which will have an "essential material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it hotly rakes uncertainly. 
It is fact that the dividend was cut. 
Already for 2007 she had been shortened around two thirds. 
The Hypo real Estate is an important state and Infrastrukturfinanzierer since the Depfa take-over. 
She is depending stronger than other institutes of the refinancing at the interbank market since she doesn't have any customer deposits. 
With the collapse of the American investment bench Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the credit award has dried up under the banks largely again since the banks hoard their liquidity. 
The Hypo real Estate needs the credit portfolio for a part, about 50 billion euros, the Depfa short-term remedies for the refinancing every year. 
After communication of the Hypo real Estate the financial requirement of the group is covered with the loan until foreseeable future and the enterprise protected "from the influence of the currently largely broken-down international money markets". 
It can be heard from other sources that thanks to the monies the refinancing is safeguarded by the end of 2009. 
The HRE chairman of the executive board Georg Funke explained, against this that must Hypo real Estate Group doesn't become the money markets until foreseeable future any more take up. 
Federal Bank and the Federal Institute of financial service supervision (BaFin) assume that the market ability of the Hypo real Estate group is safeguarded now. 
This stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank to hope. 
But probably doesn't give the crisis any certainty in view of the dynamics and imponderabilities. 
It even isn't unthinkable that the financing doesn't have to be taken up on a full scale. 
The opposite isn't auszuschleißen but either. 
After according to rumor the bank still faced the insolvency on the late Sunday evening the at least temporary rescue also isn't able to calm the people. 
The share price breaks in by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros. 
The loan courses keep themselves quite good against this. 
The prior-ranking debts hardly show themselves busy, the courses of the after-rank loans give way more considerably last. 
The loans of the former subsidiary firm Württemberg Hypo and understandably enough the over 2009 running times going out are concerned primarily. 
If Hypo real Estate loans seem formerly a speculative plant alternative, then the value must be looked at when dependent on the stability of the international financial system itself after the clear increase of the bank crisis and the institute which had fetched the crisis only into the house with the take-over of the Depfa. 
An amortization of the pensions in due time can be started out from as long as the central banks, governments and less shattered commercial banks are still ready for the support of the system, as long as. 
- or else what dares at present to hope for somebody hardly enters that the financial crisis is overcome within the next 15 months. 
But at present the reports estimating themselves with the partial nationalization have become only a legitimate hope from the probability bordering on safety. 
This might prepare long time creditors primarily, whether with the decision some sleepless nights they shall part with their engagements. 
After all, short time investors can final stroke do one use a loss lecture to the future settlement tax payments toward price gains of later years to it form.
