Lukaschenko opposition: 110-0 
In the elections on Sunday it has taken nones of representatives of the opposition to the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers think this is due to the prosperity and stability in the country commanded by Alexander Lukaschenko, the OECD suspects law adversities at the counting of the voices, though. 
The OECD which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries hasn't respected the elections. 
Although De legislation of the 10 million inhabitant state has got by without opposition for decades. This one has nevertheless seriously hoped for the other side assembled under the name "united democratic strengths" (ODS) before yesterday's elections that Lukaschenko which replaced its presidency mandate in the dirty elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment 2006 already for the fourth time would allow "some representative of the opposition" in the parliament this time. 
Therefore the ODS has taken distance even of the boycotts planned before. 
The Ukraine gets economically still dependent on Russia thanks to the increasing prices at the natural gas import. Even loans were raised for the alleviation of the price increases and the country also has agreed to the disposal of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline running through the country, to the Russians. So the hope was in the background of the expectations of the opposition, the Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukaschenko and other high-profile politicians have refusal of entry because of the political system classified as antidemocratic in the EU. 
The evaluation report of the elections of the OECD provided a temporary diversion, in which, instead of movements the emphasis rather on the positive one lay on the defects, such as the end shutdown of a third of the opposition candidates of the elections. 
The fast report of the OECD criticized the campaign -- already on Monday, though, therefore opposition might not happen in the press -- and particularly the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the counting of the voices. 
The opposition is able for a recovery recognize despite alledem in the political system: Political prisoners were put on free foot approximately and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by furthermore refusing south Ossetia and Abkhazia the appreciation of the independence of the renegade Georgian provinces although Russia with which the Ukraine on the paper forms a federal state has regarded the two areas as independent for a month. 
"We have two steps forward and unite made backward, it is, however, the most important that the dialog has started between White Russia and the EU", said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our sheet. 
In opinion of the opposition candidate of the presidential elections of 2006 a continuation is desirable although have letting only an opposition one also to the parliament "fear got the powerful ones". 
The opposition doesn't plan any protest measures in view of the results but rather tries to make the necessity of an economic reform clear to the voters. 
We have to contend with many problems " -- the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way at the sales stones but I nevertheless see that more and more people support the change, even the old person " -- told Milinkewitsch in allusion to it here that not even the most supported layer of the Pensionisten approves of the Lukaschenko regime whose only income is the production of a social safety. 
Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit merely one "is" question of time until the "social safety" bringing to mind the silence of a cemetery starts to crumble, so Milinkewitsch. 
Russian observers have described the elections as democratic unlike the opposition politician. 
Sergej Lebedev, leader of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States explained Ria Novosti to the news agency: "The people believe the deeds and not the words". The being absent of the opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the Belorussian voters.
