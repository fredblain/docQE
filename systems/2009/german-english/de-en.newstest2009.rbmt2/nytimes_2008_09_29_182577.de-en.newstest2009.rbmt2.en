The pride and the hardships in the life of the black population in a town of the quite special type 
Hidden a quiet town in which the pride and the complications of the Afro American culture appear few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic hustle and bustle is located in a radius of Orlando between the excesses of the amusement parks. 
It is Eatonville, the first completely black city of in the country and the hometown Zora Neale Hurstons, to describe no longer as simply as Hurston did it in 1935: "the town with 5 seas, three Krocketplätzen, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more as enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison." 
Nowadays it is a pilgrim place. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are Zora to the annual one! Festival come in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem renaissance. 
And nevertheless is and remains the town which describes her? federal writer project you produced and this one made her to it to a tourist destination of the outing times of the depression of this to this one by accepting it into the Florida guidebook? in many respects a place of the quite special kind. 
This one is so independently, purely and privately Eatonville like into 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black municipalities often refused in Florida to share their true thoughts with the white man ", so some over us Weiss that he not Weiss what escapes him ". 
Even nowadays in a year about race conditions a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, calls upon for an open conversation in this, many are tired of being watched by Aussenseitern here furthermore. 
We are " told very concernedly about it like our history so Hortense Jones, 59, is ", from birth an inhabitant of the town and a municipality member of the oldest church of the town. 
It must be correct." 
Eatonville was defined for a long time as a paradox of the triumph and the fight. 
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a municipality of almost 2,400 inhabitants in which the poverty quota is twice as high as the country average. 
It a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example are on the one hand -- this one culture of the rural south which is sentenced sometimes and sometimes praised -- black which has its roots in the American slavery. 
It isn't surprising that inhabitants are both proud and on the watch here. 
And really the doubts started with image actually around Eatonville with Zora, how here all Hurston call. 
She introduced her hometown to the world like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) in books which came from hearts and were written in dialect 
Five paragraphs in the Floridareiseführer changed the town which completely lies near the route 77 this one through this often forgotten center of Florida leads to the scenes of black history and human drama, a street. 
First mayor, Joe Clarke, impudent and in the literature Hurston reader led to the store of Eatonvilles as Oskar both in the actual life and turned then to more private matters. 
"It wrote, ", " offside the street to the left hand the modern school painted brown Weiss is with its well-tended gardens and playgrounds about which Howard Miller always cares although he can hardly read and write." 
She mentioned the new husband of widow also -- and wrote that " lee Glenn sells drinks of any type also and what always fits to hour rooms ". 
So in only few hundred words Hurston brought Eatonville with self-government in connection but also with illiteracy rate, second marriage and sex. 
This wasn't quite certainly a guidebook. 
This indeed wasn't a portrait which was valued by everyone. 
Zora "described" the things as they were, so, so one of the Johnson girls who more fully more sexually were allusions immortalized the Hurston by quoting the men, singing beauty about hers the the 90-year-old. 
She added: "Some people didn't like this." 
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric here, the regelmässig returned after its family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that this one is conceited in a noisy Chevrolet smoking and dressed in trousers in a town about her venerable clothes style today if Hurston came to the town rinsed off, it usually did this without warning. 
According to the Mr Franklin most inhabitants were fascinated whereas many disdained them. 
"People were always glad to see Zora", said Mr Franklin. 
But it never "stayed", added too long he was baptized in all probability in the Hurston there while he was rocking in his chair on a terrace lain to behind which looks at the Sabelia lake. 
As Hurston in 1960 poor and its books died it was unavailable. 
Together with the large part of the world Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it. 
Although she was a famous author once, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard college into the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived. 
There wasn't any great commemoration, no public readings in the great style, in Eatonville. 
"I don't think that they have understood their contribution in the world or their inheritance in the least", was published for Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography the 2003 about Hurston so. 
The turn came in the eighties. 
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-track freeway through the town to replace the Kennedy boulevard, the slow double-track main street of the municipality. 
Orlando's suburbs had already pressed the freeway 4 by the western outskirts. 
The suggestion was presented when Eatonville still recovered in its history from a difficult phase. 
Among other things compulsion had set an end the relatively idyllic isolation of the municipality integration. 
The fight against race intermixing caused hate to the community in the fifties. 
"A heap of white boys often came and they threw oranges and things on out of the way sedentary people at this time", said Mr Franklin. 
"Once a woman even gave this one killed it was. 
You threw a watermelon out of the car." 
In 1955 Hurston analyzed the demand of the colonel the decision in the case Brown against the schools inspector in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, to force integration, by it as " offending instead respecting my race " court of justice described. 
Nowadays inhabitants say that this one weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its teenagers them, although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in many a regard. 
Black children were used to being hugged " so N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the charitable group to the protection of the Eatonville community one hugged his teacher in the morning and one hugged his teacher in the evening ", I remember. 
This could be maintained so long, added her until teachers and pupils didn't come from the same place any more. 
One didn't hug his white teacher mine is availably a cultural ravine there I said to Mrs Nathiri because he was a white teacher " -- ". 
How have, however, the civil rights with positive self-confidence and statements contributed that place was made for further Zora Neale Hurstons, black authors, it did to actor and artist who disregarded prejudices like them? "How himself can somebody refuse my society the joy! 
I don't understand it." 
In the year 1975 the writer Alice got fullers on the way to Hurstons nameless grave and started to fight for the resuscitation of their glory. 
Five years later a Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway praised much could be found in the bookshelves and made them a part of the American literature canon once more. 
The highway project came exactly at a time, the most famous daughter was in the focus of the attention in the Eatonvilles once again. 
And Hurstons saw old neighbors her as a rescuer this time. 
What the district could destroy with the making of the freeway started in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival to point the municipality. 
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later and many return for the celebration every January. 
The district turned away from his street building plans for some years later. 
"The plans of a five-track highway" stimulated the town, accelerated the whole with top speed, aroused real citizen pride, said Mrs Nathiri. 
Mrs Boyd a little more simply expressed it: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change of the self picture of the town. 
Zugereiste like Rachelle Munson, an advocate who goes here to the church since 1993 and natives started to value the past newly, came more and more. 
Eatonville was included in the nationwide historical register in 1998. 
A new two-storey library (of course to Hurston named) opened in 2006 on the Kennedy surfaced new and beautified boulevard. 
Nowadays Eatonville is still an unusual feature in Florida: sometimes it can feel of the town center of Orlando like a backstreet in the summer rain, only 6 miles as smally as at that time as it was founded by only 27 black families into the 1880s. 
(Nowadays is you to 90% black.) 
Outsiders on the search for the history Eatonvilles and its meaning are often still treated with caution. 
For most interviews an approval is necessary in the front-end and certain things like the wall painting of Eatonvilles of the oldest church which was painted of a white and represents black men at the fieldwork may not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for deep red still fear that their protected community is misunderstood. 
And nevertheless became the Hurston festival more greatly, an increased degree of native country pride also got born at the same time to it. 
Primarily young people tend to see Eatonville just like Hurston saw their complete race: lovely, with all its problems, bad even better and just as impressive, creative and hard-working, silly and mixes like every other races and people group in America. 
It the sincere love for this town is this one one can hear nephews in the voice of Mr Franklins who intends to return to Eatonville after the college who could use a little help according to him, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, to work in the municipal authority or at the police. 
And even the Youngers, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from winter park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"Most people who go through only here will think: "Oh, nothing is this town in comparison with all the others", Alondra Kenon recently said to the church on a Sunday. 
"But if one actually stops and looks at his history for a moment, it is a very beautiful town."
