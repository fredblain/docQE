Meetings to the old cinema Paradiso? the towns close their historical cinema halls 
The historical cinemas close due to the favored Multiplexkinos. 
"A town without cinema halls is a blind town, like a face without eyes." 
What is happening in the big urban centers of Italy and also in the provinces at the moment describes this picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore with effect. 
The process of the marking off of the cinemas which started with the birth of the big multi-hall complexes in the periphery means the death for the one hall cinema in the long run in the center. A process which doesn't only seem inevitable and irrevocable but also carries the trains of a cultural crime. 
Concerned historical places full of memories usually shall, "it has to be lost like a friend with whom one has put a piece Strasse full of emotions back", so the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" which earned it Oskar and the large price of Cannes 20 years ago. It is to live the history of a suburb cinema and its nostalgia which consists of it in a cinema world lost for ever well. 
The numbers deliver, the Anec, the central trade association which one speaks one considerably language: within the last five years the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas must have closed; the cinemas paid this check for the most part in the large towns: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
The Emilia - Romagnas belong to the regions most deeply concerned, resulted for the Lombardy with 41. by the tuscany with 44 and with 82 lost cinemas 
This shows it that this one is main offenders the Multiplexkinos because these are just these three regions into which the largest number of these modern cinemas was registered: with 195 within the last 5 years leads the Lombardy the lists on, it is 81 both in the tuscany and in the Emilia-Romagna. 
"The business has so Paolo Protti the president of the Anec developed in an irrational way ", " it is useful that also new structures give up but the receipt is at first place the already existing because a hall closes in the town aren't all his regular customers ready to go to a Multiplexkino instead of the old person in the periphery. 
Eight and still the missing budget stays outerly for the meat juices of the trade association: the debts recorded by the state is approx. 10 million euros. 
It is a disgrace of the ethical moral point of view that the government doesn't observe the existing laws. 
To get the sector were between 16 and 18 million euros in the year of needs ". 
The case of Bologna, the first Italian town which has decided due to the worries about the old cinema halls to protect these by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec, is interesting; it is the first agreement of this way to protect and to support the traditional cinemas in Italy which aims at it and this both in the historical center and in the periphery. 
Under the foreseen measures also tax Bevorteilungen are regarding the short-distance traffic for the cinema operators as well as advantages for the audience: it will be permitted to go to the traffic limited areas of the center and in addition to park at more reasonable parking fees. 
"It is ", " a pleasant initiative so Giuseppe Tornatore, I hope that other towns will follow our example and draw up furthermore also new concepts. 
We also need a better audio and video equipment, certainly however, to be able to take a message for the Multiplexs√§le against the superpower because the audience of today is finally more demanding. 
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the shutdown of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point which got me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso" even if I had played with the thought for 10 years already. 
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; if I pass at the Rialto or at the Quirinale in this one via Nazionale there where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn round aside to not have to see the dust covered posters.
