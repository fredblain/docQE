A name for the wickedly expensive child 
The written version of the 700 bn dollar difficult rescue package law which will have to be used in several stages and aims at the purchase of the bad loans of the banks is available now. 
Half of the money shall be distributed in the first gateway. 
This one reported East coast came to an end on Saturday after midnight local time, the convention representatives have made their way to an agreement about the 700 billion dollar heavy rescue package after several days of debates to Reuters in a meeting. 
Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the American parliament, said "we have obtained essential progress", and thought one must only bring about the agreement to paper. 
Both candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the reached compromise on the rescue package. 
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson thought about the result: The program will show effect and it gets efficient, however, one still must do more. It wouldn't be all about the rescue of Wall Street here according to the Pelosi but around this, the oar of the economy rumzureißen. 
The written setting of the package was still published that is Washingtonly the time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning) before the opening of the Asian markets, however, hasn't triggered any high-altitude flight at the stock exchanges. 
On Monday the parliament votes on the law outline for the stabilization of the economy of 2008 first, then it is the senate's turn. 
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on the Saturday evening and the White House also welcomed the messages about the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress obtained in the night and the efforts of both appreciate parties, our markets stabilize and protect our economy, Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House, said. 
The program differs from the original recommendation of the Bush administration, though, according to which the 700 bn dollars should be spent on the purchase of securities which are bad and charged by loans suddenly. 
Half of the 700 billion amount shall at most be distributed in a first tranche in which 250 bn are immediately available after the convention will as expected vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum shall be spent for the purchase of credit loaded, bad securities and more than the further 100 bn USD the president shall decide. 
The program is, checked by a commission of its own this one also the president of the Federal reserve belongs. 
Other half of the 700 bn depends on another decision of the convention. 
According to the law the Treasury also can use composite tactics: It can purchase bad loans, mortgages, and securities charged by mortgages simultaneously or loans also other "poisonous." 
The purchase reported how responsible persons of the department, can be carried out both in an auction and directly. 
The law makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program at which the Treasury guarantees the alarming means and the enterprises pay corresponding charges to the damages to be expected. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means so that can be provided up to 700 bn dollars as an emergency aid for the American financial system, is for the large-scale purchase of bad means, her insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk which is triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution it. 
We set Paulson the necessary steps so so that we are ready for introduction of the law as soon as it was signed. 
The bosses of the banks got into difficulties and instructed on state help now can expect, though, that their clearances which sloppily are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang are shortened by the government. 
A cut in the salaries will give it only in certain cases and these cuts will depend on it like the Treasury respectively helps out. 
The cut means essentially that if purchases the department in the context of an auction, "Golden Handshake" is taxed so unless the clapped-out bank boss is deported in the pension. 
In the case of a direct purchase of the bad loans the government will switch itself on aggressively to make sure that the manager salaries aren't exaggerated. 
Is also proper to the picture, that existing Golden Handshake-Verträge isn't changed, the restrictions refer only to new agreements so that all the more people take part in the program. 
This is the first the democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the finance committee, the measure, commented on case in the American history that cuts are regulated at manager salaries by law. 
The state wins participation rights at the participating banks so that the risk sinks for the taxpayers since they also can participate as soon as the economy and thus also the bank saved feel better again. 
The law outline provides that the president must present a suggestion to the convention within the next five years how the taxpayers shall get their lost money back from the finance sector again. 
There were sceptics on the two sides who have expressed their doubts with respect to the plan, though. 
This which protects plan isn't what ours American citizens expect the money of the taxpayers under no circumstances, so the Californian republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur meant: The measures which are responsible also for the collapse to Wall Street were advanced by the same persons.
