Selling an obscure street in town, often forgotten and perhaps soon 
New York city center has thousands of main streets, avenues, side streets and other bypasses what some famous and others are only comfortable of. 
It nevertheless is even for easy to say experienced taxi-drivers and long-standing local ones heavily where Place is extra because most have never heard of it. 
This tiny street is in the East Village and runs of the roof ridge Street direction the north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching the Second Street. 
She is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and rather looks to a dusty lane than to a passage street used actively. 
There aren't any street signs either. 
It is practically impossible to find her on a standard street plan. 
This street has nevertheless her admirers. 
For example built Avalon Bay, a building contractor, the recently luxurious building on the roof ridge Street has. 
It wants to surface Place extra newly to create a clean passage to the stores and boutiques which are expected in the new buildings. 
The long-standing neighborhood which says it is fascinated by the short lane simply belongs to the other admirers because it is one of the remains of the past of the block of buildings. 
But the municipal authority department which is responsible for protection and erection of the dwellings and is responsible for the street isn't interested to get it. 
During a meeting of the committee for country use of the district council this month representatives of the municipal authority and Avalon Bay have drawn up a suggestion on the purchase of the street by the building contractor. 
The committee nevertheless prefers that the town has the street left in its hands and Susan Stetzer, the district responsible person in the district council 3., has asked for a new plan so which shall be presented next month 
"Only has very little room remained in the possession of the town and we would like that Place belongs to the town extra furthermore", she said. 
"There could be offers, how one repairs the street and what could be taken care of by Avalon operates but we also want that the public entrance remains guaranteed." 
Avalon Bay has announced some months ago which among other things are designed for a café to which the enterprise would like to rent out room the small ones surface street newly and set up seats. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public during the meeting for the first time this month. 
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman of the Avalon Bay, said that although the enterprise wanted to use the street it, however, doesn't want really to have it. 
It is "the main concern of the Avalon Bay" to renovate this dilapidated lane and to make a public meeting place, she said and added that the town had suggested alone the sale. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman of the department of Gebäudeschutz thought it has actually been the wish of the town to sell and emphasized it is rather the task of the department to develop the real estate but to manage, the street. 
Compared with its colored neighborhood The Bowery Place has a little kept a historical impression extra of his. 
Some think that the street has got their name in 1802 when a big farm which belonged to Philip Minthorne was divided up between his numerous children and a narrow stripe country of no-one used. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk skirt monument, this in 2006, was closed, Place opened extra to this and the street is confessed certainly most as a scenery for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" of Ramones. 
The plaster was excellent, Danny Fields, the manager the Ramones which had taken the picture in November 1976, said. 
The street was full of scrap metal, rags and parts of barrels, Postern, sheets and ropes. 
Some residents, einschliesslich of the Blogger which write about the Gentrifizierung of the East Village, have the idea of the sale of furthermore Place shall publicly extra remain with the argument that these public property, so modest are like it, declined. 
Others have extra praised Place as a rareness? a practically unchanged splinter of the town which should be left alone. 
Named "Jeremiah's insignificant New York" which operates the Blog the book the complaints, (Jeremiah Moss subtitles ": A bitter nostalgic look at the town dying out has a part of the conversation of the town history "), about published Place extra which had seemed "Thely New York" in the magazine in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, has written at that time: "Place extra is a little narrow dead end which remains dark even during the day and it is labeled for the storehouses, locked windows and week old newspapers flying past to gutters by a rusty metal door". 
With few exceptions the street has recently in an evening looked exactly so. 
A rat ran through the back part of the street, today, far where a more expensive clothes business is not located in the door which used to lead to the CBGB. 
Could graffiti be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle didn't lie on the ground far of a fresh bundle of scrapped newspapers. 
Some passers-by said, they would seldom have about Place thought extra but suggested that the street could be polished up a little. 
Fields, added that people underestimate the attraction of the street in his opinion, some in their current condition. 
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places which were dark, damp and disgusting.
