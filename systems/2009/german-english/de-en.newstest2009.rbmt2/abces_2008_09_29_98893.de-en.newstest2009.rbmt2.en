'Sangre de Mayo': Hero book of Garci 
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' of Benito Pérez Galdós José Luis Carci represents the revised version of the famous rebellion of the Spaniards in 'Sangre de Mayo' against the Frenchmen. This is an admirable film in the Filmografie with an around 15 million euros investment for the lathe works. 
Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of the actors this way the cineaste has tried 'to represent an amount of personalities and social analysis', what he has always admired at the works of the famous novelist. 
With a film length of more as two and a half hours 'Sangre de Mayo' is presented in cinemas on Friday and shown on the transmitter Telemadrid as a four-hour small series later to these. 
Assured to José Luis Garci, tall fan of the literature of Galdós, that thanks to this lathe work his 'childhood dream' was fulfilled. It has this one to thank Esperanza Aguirre for it, Madrid engaged it to shoot a commemorative film to the second Jahrhundertsfeier in Madrid on November 2nd three years ago of the autonomous community. Primarily because the story on the basis of 'Episodios Nacionales' is based, this one accepted the order. 
The picture of this Garci offers, how it caused the complete contribution of 15 million which was made by the autonomous community for lathe works to Madrid ' tangled Spain which chose the wrong leader for the fight up because the people by the fight for the independence and under the rule of Ferdinand of the VII in delay took had been to represent, the 'single possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding Bekleidungen, '. 
The cineaste isn't, however, that with the financing as in the case of 'Alatriste' or ' //de// ' (twice so high as at ' //de// ') sorry one Lo's fantasmas could, because of this Goya some scenes could from the film script with Horacio Valcárcel, with the Garci almost its whole career cooperated, not shifted, count Sangre be Mayo. 
For this reason Garci which was also a film director in 'Volver are empezar' has played a part by its ordinary mode of operation: it adapted itself to the stage to the actors, with which one must rehearse first before what one begins to shift and for those which hadn't made any casting turned up it ' humiliating a part of the profession of the film director consists 'and providing with respect, ' in helping in the theater and in the cinema to know in the cinema industry in which one works, happens.' 
Many actors they run in 'Sangre de Mayo' into must repeat in front of their camera like in the case of Miguel Rellán Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations it (has) won one of which, is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates who represent Spain this year in front of the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Sangre neither ' //de// Mayo neither ' nor ' Siete mesas //de// billar francés ' and finally also not the select film 'lot girasoles ciegos'. 
For this film Garci doesn't expect any awards. 
At the beginning you think ', that you work for the descendants, you notice later that it is for prospering only and you are content now if one has still produced a film ', Garci declares 30 years work after more.
