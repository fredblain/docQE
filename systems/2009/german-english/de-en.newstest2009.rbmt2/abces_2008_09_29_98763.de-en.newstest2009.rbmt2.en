I 'greet' the master Günter Brauer photographer behind the stage to hold his character tight. 
No sales, no ruche, no outfits for the appearance. 
Getting the nature of the great flamenco dancers who do without the concentration and devote themselves to the interpretation around an eased appearance as woman or as man. 
On the one hand artist 
On the other hand personality 
I look into private lifes in these moments which are strange for the audience, I know when I can find a gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or out pushing strength of the hands which are gotten because they won't enter the stage. 
In his project 'flamenco people' the German photographer Günter represents farmer change empires staginess of some productions on the stage with singer, dancer and guitarists. He was still little noted for the artists from this side. 
With this suggestion the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamenco representation at different levels. 
The exhibition the artist explains 'the international importance of flamenco which gets bigger and bigger from the day to day reflects' and makes clear the flamenco listened to, that this one for the program of the month of the photography isn't typical pictures on the stage that, ' it flamenco people can be any arbitrary person then however if one has a look at the photos the observer remembers of artist. 
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to move passion, sadness, pleasure of mediating and with that the audience on the stage. 
To be able to hold the personality of these artists tight, one doesn't have to take any pictures on the stage. 
Your personality and its character is in its hearts. 
What I was interested was this one would create a friendly atmosphere to hold the characters of the tallest flamenco masters tight with the photo camera make it possible for me '. 
Cante de farmer inspired by the festival 'read' Minas, made 1997 on a long journey to itself in the year to take a photograph of singer, Gitaristen or dancer with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the picture sorting function of the camera and the available material pictures which remind of a classic photography arose. 
The application of different stylistic means destroys the classic basis of the picture through which the modernity and the idea are awarded to the picture as the farmer understands flamenco: 'Music with traditional roots which changes and surprises every day'. 
These are not only the dance, the song or the instrumental game to himself but the personality of the artist, his character which seduces the audience with its art. 
The search for the essential after a certain something, which one, in form of hearing his visibly becomes, the firm aim of this work which is presented arms in the gallery of the tbsp Fotómata in the near future is and was. 
Confessed Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente amigo and others belong to personalities for the narrow choice of the almost seventy artists who were photographed in flamenco under them. 
The project became an anthology of the flamenco and will be published as a book with all portraits from the exhibition soon. 
Bauer's passion for the portraits made him take up two years ago once again and put into effect as 'portraits of the veterans of the sports' this idea ('SportARTproject'). 
Although the concepts of the project 'flamenco people' are different the photographer admits ' so I like very much to take a photograph of people, become acquainted with them and put me into the life condition it is for a short moment or one for some time. 
I think that the portrait is the most difficult genre in the area of the photography. 
You meet or push on persons, personalities whom you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a couple minutes to be able to take a picture. 
Except for these circumstances I try always as a photographer to put my ideas into effect.'
