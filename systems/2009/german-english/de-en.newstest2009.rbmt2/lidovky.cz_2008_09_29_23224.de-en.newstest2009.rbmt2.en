The Sudeten demanded a referendum of the USA 
The Sudeten Germans had requested the affiliation of the Böhmerwaldes to the United States in 1945. 
This results from a letter which is stored in the collections of the south Bohemian scientific library. 
If we cannot be component of Germany or Austria, then we would like to live under the patronage of the United States of America at least. 
With such a wish some groups of Sudeten Germans shall have addressed the U.S. president in 1945. 
Among other things this results from a letter which has remained unchanged in a private archive and which is kept in the collections of the south Bohemian scientific library today. 
The Germans of Krumau ask the American president, he in the letter the return of the "Sudetengaus" shall not permit -- this one was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement -- to Czechoslovakia. 
It is said in a letter which is signed with the words "people who are concerned about the destiny of the Sudeten" "we have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units don't enter a German territory as oppressor and enemies but as a liberator". 
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia suggests in knowledge of the Czech national character that they would expect brutality, inconsiderateness, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery to the Sudeten Germans, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take on the protection about the Böhmerwald for today and open eternally. 
We "cannot" think that you award this area to one without consideration for the view of a quarter million inhabitants for a state foreign to us which suppresses and has tried to remove and nothing at all contributed to the victory of the Allies purely minorities, has to be read in the letter. 
The reason for it why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge desires of the "Czech oppressors". 
If the U.S. president entertains doubt about the fundamental attitude of the Böhmerwalddeutschen, it is sufficient if he would initiate a referendum about this in the Böhmerwaldgau whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or to live under the protection of the United States. 
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of the after-war history, it draws, however, a good picture in opinion of some contemporary witnesses with regard to the expectations of the Sudeten Germans then. 
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to suspect at least that one would negotiate about their deportation from the republic, only some of them admitted such a possibility to themselves at all. 
Some waited that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten. 
Again others thought they simply could stay in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa who is from Budweis also confirms this one. 
He was appointed Budweiser German in the war in the navy at the Baltic Sea. 
When he came into a British captivity at the end of the war and one took him to a war prison camp to Holstein, dozens of further Bohemian Germans came to him, he shall teach them Czech. 
You thought if they came home " so Chalupa would get them the Czech to fits come ". 
Nobody of the German prisoners of war which had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war calculated in his opinion that one would him expel decrees from the republic?on the basis of the Bene.
