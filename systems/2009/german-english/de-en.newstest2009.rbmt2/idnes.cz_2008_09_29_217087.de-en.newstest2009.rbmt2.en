The first virtual supplier comes to Czechia already this year. 
Perhaps 
The cellular market in Czechia is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer all services practically, like them are offered for partners also of hers in Western Europe. 
Something is nevertheless missing here, a virtual supplier who forces the classic ones to lower prices. 
Perhaps this will let wait for himself no longer. 
The Czech mobile telephone suppliers work to the most expensive ones in Europe at all, we already have about it often reported on Mobil.cz that. 
This also confirmed the telecommunications authority by the way TÚ which drew one's attention that the price for a SMS is higher than in the rest of the European Union here?. 
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of the roaming charges it so probably comes to a paradoxical situation -- for some customers of the Czech mobile telephone suppliers, from abroad, SMS will be cheaper than at home. 
How does it come that the prices are so high in the comparison with Europe in Czechia? 
The answer is simple, the competition which a declaration of war makes actual is absent. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, there are three mobile phone networks and a Penetration of far more than 100% in Czechia anyway. 
On the other hand, the mobile telephone suppliers like to complain about it, that there is much competition on the Czech market. 
The chairman of the advice of the Czech telecommunications authority often agrees (?)?, at, TÚ with it Pavel Dvo ák, too, which had that there is no place for another supplier in Czechia often said in the past. 
It makes probable that a classic supplier has no longer particularly many chances with a net of his own (he probably would by the way also hardly find frequencies.) 
However, there still is a possibility, a virtual supplier. 
Definitely the admission of virtual suppliers on the cellular market brought about a clear price reduction with himself to which the classic mobile telephone suppliers then had to react, too. 
There still were similar voices like in Czechia on the market in Great Britain with the admission of such companies like Tesco mobile or Virgin mobile. 
However, it have turned out that there is place for such suppliers and that this can be really successful. 
One by the way doesn't need for a long time to look for examples. 
We have reported over the start of the virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland in February this. 
In only half a year this supplier managed to win more than 100 one thousand customers and to climb to the five largest supplier of the country so. 
Behind Mobilking the finance group of Penta stands, among other things this one U: phons has in Czechia. 
The advantage of virtual suppliers consists that one can concentrate on a much more concrete target group. 
To be able to work effectively, virtual suppliers need namely much less customers as a classic supplier. 
You don't need relatively high costs for the making, the operation and the conversation of a mobile net namely. 
The virtual suppliers usually make a name for themselves as Low-Cost companies in the world out so, they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, what is often accompanied by a less extensive service offering, though. 
So Tesco mobile offers SMS as its competitors at least around the half more cheaply in Great Britain, for example. 
As the example of Mobilking points, however, in Poland, it also can be a quite good gambit not to put a stereotyped target group on one. 
This supplier consults namely specifically men. 
Real guys choose Mobilking the supplier whom so David Seibert, the CEO of the mobile Entertainment company, the operator company of this virtual supplier, they like and whom they can trust " -- ". 
Hard to say whether foot could take hold of a similar concept like in Poland also in Czechia. 
The press agent of Vodafone Miroslav also doubts it?epick ý: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment most virtual suppliers are based on. 
In addition, he is relatively made replete from the view of the service offering." 
The mobile telephone suppliers mean in Czechia bound to lose 
However, it is almost sure that will be this not Mobilking, if a virtual mobile telephone supplier conquers Czechia. 
"We talk about an expansion of this successful project but the negotiations don't look hopeful particularly in Czechia. 
It will rather come to a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region ", ková, press agent of the finance group of Penta, says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studni so?. 
She indirectly confirmed so that the present mobile telephone suppliers are inclined in Czechia towards this thought not particularly. 
On the contrary, they try to do everything for this that no potential competitor arises. 
Your interest in a start of a virtual mobile telephone supplier shows the group of GTS Novera already for quite a long time which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area of company customers. 
"We have a great interest not to offer our customers only fixed network, but also mobile telephone telecommunications services. 
And the earlier, the better. 
We have negotiated about this possibility repeated with all Czech mobile telephone suppliers. 
We could already reach negotiation progress ", so the press agent of the group of Pavel Kaidl with some of them. 
Perhaps better times are coming now. 
Information not goes out that the first virtual supplier has to be expected perhaps by the end of the year from official. 
This is surrounded by an invincible wall of the silence till now, however. 
"At this moment, we don't assume, that place consists for a full virtual supplier in Czechia. 
The Czech market shows great Spezifika compared with other markets. 
E has appealed no subject to us ", in his explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr thinks?with a complex and serious project in this area till now yet? from the press department of Telefónica O2. 
Also further suppliers point to the Spezifik of the Czech market. 
The press agent of T mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the explanation of O2: "We haven't found any viable and on both sides advantageous project till now on which one could further build." 
And she adds: "Hardly a virtual supplier will appear in the net of T mobile by the end of the year. 
At this moment we already should a concrete offer be available have to be able to think so quickly." 
Vodafone rather turns its attention towards the fulfillment of the requirements of the 3 of one's own g license. 
Epick ý thinks Miroslav about it?: "We are straight negotiations with potential virtual suppliers particularly in the area of dividing costs and infrastructure. 
We regard exactly this as the best one from the view of the customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is the search for a partner to the construction of a split net for a fast mobile Internet." 
The responsible authorities with the suppliers Hand in hand 
The procedure of the mobile telephone suppliers is easy to understand, another supplier would be called more competition, this also would lead this to a fall in the profits at dropping prices and through. 
So why should one make the market entry easier for such a competitor? 
The long proves also to that the suppliers can draw at a rope if it is about something and Her around the emergence of U: phon. 
TÚ went out in the direction of?, as at the moment the probably heaviest pressure U: phon came onto the market from the society T mobile. 
The publicly accessible information also covers this TÚ web pages of the?. 
U: phon as an argument why one shouldn't allow a virtual supplier is just suitable now, however. 
Martina Kemrová noticed to this: "The competition environment of the cellular market was recently still strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile telephone supplier, in addition. 
Under consideration of the character of the cellular market in the Czech Republic a new protagonist is obvious that his would on the market make services high demands alone and primarily." 
In view of this Herangehensweise of the mobile telephone suppliers the absolute lack of interest of the Czech regulation authorities astonishes, though. 
It this one isn't only it the attitude?TÚ which unfortunately doesn't have the competence in Czech as opposed to Great Britain and further highly developed states to intrude on the economic competition. 
This exclusively has the office to the protection of the economic competition (ÚOHS). 
However, this bought his quite typical attitude at these complete difficulties. 
"The market entry of a virtual mobile telephone supplier then would be possible after it has come to a completion of a contract between a mobile telephone supplier and a virtual supplier about the rental of the necessary infrastructure. 
No such contract was concluded till now because the supply of potential interested parties probably wasn't interesting sufficiently for the classic suppliers ", about in his answer to our enquiry Kristián Chalupa of the department outer relations of the ÚOHS. 
Of representatives of the suppliers such a wording wouldn't surprise. 
Of an authority which shall represent the consumer interests and among other things pay attention to it that nobody abuses his position on the market this is more than dubious. 
Particularly if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad where virtual suppliers work quite normally it has to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction at mobile telephone services." 
The pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction probably are not part of the interests of the ÚOHS, however. 
The harmony of the three mobile telephone suppliers almost already stirring which arises from their reactions really is shocking at this case. 
The question whether it really only is chance is obvious. 
The absolutely identical price of gasoline for certain is just like only chance and the result of a hard competition for the gas stations. 
"The authority has discovered no symptoms in this thing which indicate a behavior aimed at the competition and it therefore doesn't have any reason to intervene in the matter in any way either. 
None of the suppliers has a dominant position in the market, he therefore doesn't have the corresponding increased responsibility for his behavior on the market either. 
The regulation authority probably also lacks the necessary instruments for an opening of the cellular market for virtual suppliers for telecommunications ", Chalupa led in its explanation. 
One is the interpretation of the dominating position on the market from many controversial points. 
Of course there is an analysis of the relevant markets TÚ, worked out of the?, one single market is after the telecommunications from the view of the economic competition. 
None of the Czech mobile telephone suppliers then holds a dominating position on such a market of course. 
Some on the right experts offer another position, however -- the consent of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual supplier. 
And the mobile telephone supplier has the monopoly for his net logically. 
This one means that he takes a dominating position necessarily in a certain segment. 
Even if one, however, doesn't go along with this argumentation, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile telephone suppliers proceed conspicuously similarly. 
Troubles of a number of interested parties prove (including the mentioned society GTS Novera) that they push during negotiations with all suppliers on very similar obstacles. 
TÚ is then a quite usual trick with which the ÚOHS of the whole matter dissociates itself the Abwälzung of the responsibility on this one in the telecommunications services?. 
This had already to be watched in some similar cases. 
Unfortunately, it isn't excellently, into the amendment of the telecommunications law recently adopted the?the expansion of the competences to succeed on the area of the economic competition in the telecommunications with TÚ although a number of experts had itself promised an improvement in the situation of this. 
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this only too well but probably they have other interests. 
It already works if nobody looks 
Unnoticed remains once the functioning of any pseudovirtueller suppliers of whom there is several in the Czech mobile phone networks at once. 
It is companies which spend price lists of their own on mobile telecommunications services which, however, only partly are public. 
It usually is namely companies which proceed in the area of multi-level marketing. 
Mobile telephone services of one's own offer Starlife and others to Amway, Bohemia Telecom, for example. 
The price lists of these companies usually reach only to chosen. 
The joke of the thing consists that the company appears as a classic corporate customer opposite the operator who orders one large amount of SIM cards. 
As an important customer he then receives special quotations (and other offers). 
The problem consists in the fact that the business conditions of all Czech mobile telephone suppliers forbid a resale taken similarly. 
"There should be cases, which you describe, then it can be an injury of the contractual conditions, which deal we then will, what can lead to a completion of the cooperation with the appropriate society", answered Martina Kemrová on our question on this problem. 
It is quite improbable that something like that doesn't get round with the persons responsible of the mobile telephone suppliers, though. 
Particularly in the fall of the three mentioned companies it can be thousands customers. 
No operator opposes, however, such a procedure. 
Profits to be not neglected namely go from the activity of these companies to them, they aren't impaired by the real official marketing as opposed to the actual virtual suppliers simultaneously. 
Miroslav draws one's attention to possible problems?epick ý attentive: "The law makes such kinds of speculation possible, despite everything the services of these companies are only used by a very little percentage of the customers. 
Furthermore these must accept that the SIM card doesn't run in telephone of their on name of their, so they cannot have it fully like the normal customers of the mobile telephone suppliers." 
Spare this alone but this one must?at least seem strange to TÚ. 
In addition, further question opens up for the ÚOHS. 
Do the mobile telephone suppliers lock the eyes before such a procedure, why do they balk at a virtual supplier? 
Himself it is added that the ÚOHS for the uncovering of such activities has quite strong competences and it must, if it doesn't want, the supplier, it wouldn't know nothing with the explanation and these would its business conditions forbid, be content. 
When Czechia isn't the most expensive any more 
How was emphasized already repeatedly in the text, did the market entry of virtual suppliers bring a clear price recession about at the different services? 
The classic suppliers have practically tried in all countries where virtual suppliers have arisen to prevent the emergence practically more or less. 
The arguments used by them were practically identically -- a too more smally or too very more saturatedly market, problems at the quality of the services etc.. 
However, the regulation organs which tried to keep the interests of the mobile suppliers but those of their customers not at all stepped in in the highly developed countries just at these moments. 
Be by formal measures or not formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator arose and further followed this. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulation organs throw the whole case to themselves like a hot potato. 
Starting out from our experiences we cannot rid ourselves of the impression that uncertainty is more than favorable in these cases in the competences. 
But we don't throw the shotgun into the grain. 
Perhaps soon, if the background information is correct and a virtual supplier appears soon, the Czech cellular market will get again into movement. 
If a supplier allows the origin of a virtual mobile telephone supplier, the ÚOHS won't remain idle if it is all about decline further interested parties (discriminate against). 
And then the Czeches will not make a telephone call finally any more expensively than the rest of Europe.
