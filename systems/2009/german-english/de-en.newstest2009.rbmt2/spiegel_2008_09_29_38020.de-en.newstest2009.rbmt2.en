Also rats have feelings 
Flees a rat or a cockroach this means in case of danger that they also feel fear? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Animals have also much feelings. 
Could one check whether she as only feel the same if she behave similarly like us? 
Contributions of famous scientists have been published in the Internet magazine "Edge" for several years. 
Mirror online presented in a series' select answers to the question "thinks" what to be able prove you for true, without it? 
I think that animals have feelings and other consciousness conditions without otherwise me or somebody being able to prove this till now where we cannot even that other people have consciousness prove. 
But in this case we may hope at least since all human brains show the same basic configuration. 
And questions we cut, enter a rough area because the hardware doesn't agree as soon as we turn to however other species the feel or quite generally the consciousness. 
If a rat gets into danger, it does the same like many other animals: It plays dead, escapes or attacks. 
People behave like themselves on experiencing a comparable one subjectively infer some scientists from what. 
I don't believe in it, though. 
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer to it experiencing us subjectively of animals. 
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with the human consciousness include the lateral präfrontalen Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the execution-/ control functions). 
This broad region, with man, is developed much more highly than at the other priorities and seems to be missing with other creatures completely. 
So reason for the assumption that man is even different from the other priorities insists to plan and to decide the knowledge who we are and the ability under this at least at those aspects of our consciousness which depend on the präfrontalen Cortex. 
Another dramatic peculiarity might lie in the language nature of man: Such a large portion it is connected to language, is often said the consciousness depends on it since experience his. 
In this case one could exclude animals. 
But even if consciousness wouldn't depend on language this would influence it certainly so that consciousness-ours would be different himself may be animal consciousness would be entitled, obtain like it also, probable very much of most. 
Therefore is hard to find out how consciousness may look among other animals. 
If it can be neither measured nor analyzed because of the special hardware using our own experience as a little internal and subjective, then its investigation confronts us with great problems. 
Most of my explanations refer experience on the contents of the conscious but still there is another aspect of the consciousness besides that which more simply might scientifically be accessible. 
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without consideration for their contents and this exactly happens at studies of the short-term memory of priorities particularly at the example of the visualization. 
But at this approach which Christof cook and Francis Crick followed one rather resorts to the neuralen correlates of the consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical or also not. 
This approach interestingly enough also emphasizes the significance of the präfrontalen Cortex for the taking place of the visualization. 
What gives up for the feelings now? 
I explain it by it, that an emotional system like that one of the fear is activated in a conscious of its own activity brain. 
So what we describe as "fear" the activity of the defense system identified in the brain (or its consequences, how physical reactions) are the mental condition in which we are if working memory covers. 
So seen feelings are tied narrowly to the regions of the Cortex which honor primacies and man. 
Ascribing fine graduations of feeling also others around them next to us ourselves because we can differentiate and categorize conditions with the help of the words and the grammar to themselves connectedly to the language nature devotedly. 
Antonio Damasio on the other hand thinks, for example, that more concentrates, however, the himself, feelings result from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the Cortex and the brainstorm like Jaak Pankseep on the brainstorm. 
Since this network hasn't changed itself very much in the course of the human evolution, it can absolutely be involved in genre general feelings. 
I purely theoretically cannot contradict this it regards, however, as unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues what appears with rats and people like fear feels probably also in the two cases that way: How can one check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly, however? 
Flees a cockroach whether in case of danger it also feels fear? 
Bare behavior similarity cannot prove any Erlebensgleichheit in my eyes yet. 
Although the neurale comparison helps along: Rats and people don't even have similar brainstorms, cockroaches a brain against this. 
But the brainstorm is responsible for feelings? 
And even if one could prove this for man: How did one want to prove it with rats? 
I think that have feelings rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows), ?. 
But I wouldn't know how I should prove this. 
And because her feelings are presumably basically different from ours (since the human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats. 
At all events progress is in store here at the neuralen level provided that one measures the same with rats and people. 
I don't know how I don't investigate language and consciousness, not feelings, among rats so either, whether anyway they exist. 
One may regard this as nearsighted but I prefer to get on but permanently to run against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist.
