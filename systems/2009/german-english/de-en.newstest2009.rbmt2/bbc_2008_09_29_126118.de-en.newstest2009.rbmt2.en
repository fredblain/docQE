Fears around the anti polio initiative in Afghanistan 
In the latest anti polio initiative in Afghanistan almost 200 000 children haven't been vaccinated due to the force which is taken to connection with the Taliban, so the united nations. 
The united nations have carried out a vaccine in six provinces last week. 
They, however, couldn't reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for safety reasons in the south. 
According to a spokesman of the UN this was the case despite the promise of the Taliban not to attack or to handicap the thousands employees running through the vaccinations.
