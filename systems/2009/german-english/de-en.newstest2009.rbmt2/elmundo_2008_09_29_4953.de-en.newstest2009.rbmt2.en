Talking in the sleep 
Some children speak at night 
I mean not those which wake up and tell us something what has happened on the day in front of that but the children who speak during the sleep. 
It happens to you for the first time, you will have been frightened in the best case but in the reality this doesn't have a meaning if. 
This is a positive sleeplessness which speaking in the sleep is called. 
She is rather common primarily with the children and teenagers. 
More than one was surely told by you that you have spoken at night. 
This phenomenon can appear occasionally (live one times in it every day for example as lasting the high fever) or regularly (one times per week, one times in the month) ., can the child remember nothing the next day. 
There isn't any single reason which causes this appearance. 
Connections with other appearances in the sleep looked for, like nightmares, panic-stricken fear, often are Enuresis noctura bed-wetting, (at night), speaks in the sleep looked for, there, however, isn't any reason for it at night. 
As we have already used to mention it it can to very high fiber, stress situations or overtaxing lie. 
In any case this is phenomenon investigated a little. 
The frequency with which it appears is very variable. 
It can be that one speaks quietly in single words whispers or it can completely be an opposite (cries, wines, long discussions.) 
If the remark is very intensive, it is recommended to the cases to watch the child and to let advise itself with a specialist to check whether there is a problem which causes fear and this way takes place into. 
We have said that it is a positive disturbance therefore it isn't treated, it is, it is connected to another sleeplessness which can be treated (for example with the sleep apnea or with the stress). 
What one can do is carry out one series of simple preventive measures: 
Attempts not to excite the child before sleeping. 
Quiet therefore, choose game for the child and avoid stressful stations which are terrible and a little too wild. 
Among the nervous children whom diversions are recommended diversion methods can be used to help them to get a certain inner quiet. 
This helps the child to sleep quietly. 
Keeping the quiet temptedly, if speaking in the sleep happens once. 
Thinks that it is harmless for the child and, the next day, it will be able remember nothing which has happened. 
Useful advice 
Don't wake it up. 
This is useless because the child is unconscious, you will wake it from the sleep so. 
Although the child speaks, it sleeps therefore it rests. 
It thinks if himself shows after a couple to appearances frightened it is recommended so to let advise himself or to find out which reason the child has for the fear. 
If they understand what it says (what is not so ordinary), the child doesn't put under pressure to carry out an examination and get more information back. 
So you will be able achieve nothing with that because if the child sleeps, it is unconscious and can't think. 
In addition, you will hear what it says but you won't know what it dreams and they are carefully conclusions with the interpretation of the information and this one which you draw from it because of this why it says this. 
It perhaps doesn't say to the child that hear this at night and know its secrets for her. 
Not even as a joke. 
This causes a lot of fear. 
So nothing bad causes you no worries, it is, this is a moment which lasts for only few minutes.
