Duel on Messers blade: MP3 player against mobile telephones. 
We advise you in your choice 
While almost every mobile telephone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a telephone call yet. 
It therefore looks so of course that it is better to buy only a telephone for itself. 
Despite everything there are sufficient reasons for it why one should get himself an independent player. 
The choice completely depends the future owner on the way of the use and the claims off. 
One for certain buys a terrific expensive record player for himself hardly for at home to listen on this to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
Once, such musical novelties don't appear on LPs and there isn't any objective reason for it from the qualitative view either. 
If you have, however, LPs with kind of skirt, jazz or blues in the shelf, you probably dream at least of a such. 
So this is expressed in simplified terms also with the music on journeys that is with compressed music, music in the MP3 format. 
There are price and quality categories also. 
Perhaps for the one it isn't acceptable to spend crowns on a player eight thousand, a pink Floyd fan will hardly well as well cope with headphones for twenty crowns of the market, however. 
Two extremes between which gives for every sufficient room. 
The choice is diversified broadly. 
The life time of the batteries is also decisive. 
Much more than only music can play Music player but they don't even create by way of a hint what mobile telephones can do some good. 
No modern device has to be used as universally as the telephone. 
Besides the primary functions, making a telephone call and sending an SMS a worse camera it can represent music and videos, both takes, it has a better and can navigate perhaps also. 
And, if one still includes the smart phon and communicators, one has almost a little computer in the bag. 
It is a small miracle because no refrigerator can grill and no television set take a photograph. 
But the universality of the mobile telephones also brings about disadvantages. 
Be of use for the more functions on your mobile telephone, the more frequently will you have to reload it, however. 
And is playing music one of the greatest energy eaters. 
Only few mobile telephones can play music longer than zehn-zwölf hours, it is much fewer mostly. 
In this regard Music player is (special the simple) considerably efficient. 
Therefore you should expect at the cheap mobile telephones with that that they cannot play longer than a couple of hours music. 
If, from time to time, you then still make a telephone call, you prefer to buy another battery charger at safety reasons for yourself for the office -- this also applies to a more expensive equipment. 
Wanting to not you have this problem at MP3-Playern, the less good ones also bear uninterrupted business with a loading time for at least 9 hours. 
There is another problem when one wants to cover the music up on the mobile telephone. 
Unfortunately, only a low part of the equipment has a USB degree, in addition, everybody doesn't have for himself attached mobile telephone to a PC without special software directly. 
Of course one can cover the music up directly on a storage medium, becomes only few card film readers without diminution ready with the tiny memory cards which are used into mobile telephones. 
You don't need special software at Playern except for exceptions (iPod). 
You need to feed the device only over USB port with music from your PC. 
Most mobile telephones and player lay out a music library, organized according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or for example the assessment by users themselves. 
Some equipment shows only the tree structure of the address list both iriver (Samsung Sony Cowon intelligent telephones with operating system), similarly like the Windows Explorer, some be able to. 
Are player more easily to use, mobile telephones can do more 
You should particularly ask the choice of a concrete device about the life time of the accumulator, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and of course also the using comfort. 
Music is primarily scenery for you and you listen to it every day in the streetcar only briefly, for example, an arbitrary mobile telephone which plays MP3 files then suffices. 
What almost every mobile telephone can really already do. 
You don't have to check also particularly, which music formats a mobile telephone or a player can process. 
Everyone creates MP3 and most music which you get will just be in this format. 
The format is part of the most common and in addition, most equipment also can play music in the WMA format. 
AAC (a format which Apple and its iPods use) is less usual. 
Better mobile telephones also make the purchase of music online possible. 
One only needs to call the appropriate sides of a provider (or another supplier) over a mobile Internet and one already can purchase a song or album. 
This service can already actually be an apt argument for it why one should get himself a music mobile telephone. 
Unfortunately, the supply of the providers is badly and limitedly only on fast radio hits mostly. 
The prices aren't the lowest ones either. 
One generally assumes, that (however, exactly this manner of the sale of music be about GSM, Internet wireless) it the music industry will master in future. 
Most carry the mobile telephone at themselves. 
If you feel like sounding a little, you reach in the coat pocket for the mobile telephone while the player forgotten is lying at home. 
It depends, however, on whether you always carry headphone or at least a wireless free phone facility at themselves, too. 
You can go back to the integrated loudspeaker which almost every mobile telephone has if not but MP3 player only the few. 
The probably biggest advantage of the music mobile telephones will lie in the price for many. 
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns. 
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a quite decent walkman. 
The greatest handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are there. 
The best and technically most mature telephones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns. 
In turn the player is the light operation the advantage. 
(See) choice the simple and not absolutely cheap -- each player really can use. 
One, with the operation with a the in the past normal cassette recorder or for example the record player minimum is obvious to functions, the similarity. 
No collision threatens in form of a mistakenly hired mobile Internet and a then horrendous invoice for data transmissions. 
One should reach for which device now 
The cheapest mobile telephones (e.g. Vodafone 527) also have a Slot for interchangeable storage media (type m2, microSD and ä), as a rule. 
Even if you buy a corresponding card later, two thousand crowns suffice. 
But respect. 
As a rule, only cards are supported with a maximum capacity of 2 GB at the base models. 
Only the most expensive ones also can read 8 GB memory cards. 
If you want to have a mobile telephone already and buy another cheap MP3 player for themselves, then you reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
You then don't have to put crowns on the table depending on capacity (max. 2 GB) any more than 1100. 
If you belong to the more demanding listeners, you take mobile telephones, walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung), specialized prefer. 
This equipment has independent using buttons for MP3 and the using comfort approaches that one of a single MP3 player so. 
MP3 player is the furthest here Sony Ericsson, his mobile telephones have the same user interface as these sold one by one from the series walkman. 
Accumulator life time (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) reaches for the same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and one do you MP3 player of the manufacturers mentioned above.
