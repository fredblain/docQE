A dark matter influences flight of space probes 
For years a mysterious phenomenon has provided when searching for helplessness: A dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing by maneuvers. 
Experts fear that the general relativity theory Albert Einsteins could be not quite right. 
The space probe "Ulysses" flew almost 18 years through the space. 
Because of fuel lines freezing soon the death by cold threatens her now. 
A mysterious phenomenon has provided confusion, the swing by-Anomalie, under scientists for years. 
The swing by is an aerial maneuver of space probes at which they receive an additional swing in the gravitational field of a celestial body, approximately the earth. 
Through this the probes can save much fuel. 
The European American research probe Cassini-Huygens was of use this physical trick just like the sun probe for Ulysses. 
What astonishes the researchers already for years, though? The flying objects don't behave so 100 per cent as one would expect it according to the time-honored law of gravity. 
It rather comes to irregularities in the speed. 
The probes get unexpectedly faster or slower. 
Till now, the physicists couldn't explain this effect. 
You christened him swing by-Anomalie. 
Some experts fear that even the general relativity theory Albert Einsteins which describes the appeal of matter by a bend of the room could possibly be not quite right. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still thinks tightly that Einstein wasn't mistaken and tries to explain the swing by-Anomalie with the help of the so-called dark matter astronomers have agreed in the universe on. 
He writes "responsible for the Anomalie could be a dark matter which could also completely be nearby the earth". 
The space researchers have known about the existence of the dark matter only for about ten years. 
Obviously an appeal starts out from her whose effect on other celestial bodies can be watched. 
She is, however, completely invisible, this means she sends and no electromagnetic radiation, particularly flat don't reflect visible light either. 
After the calculations of the scientists the dark matter agrees on after all good one fifth of the complete mass of the universe.
