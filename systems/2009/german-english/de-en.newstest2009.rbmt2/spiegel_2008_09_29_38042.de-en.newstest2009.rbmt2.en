Prices for plane tickets and hotels drop 
In first half of the year 2008, in Europe, flights and overnight stays were cheaper than in the previous year. 
Flights got even up to 50 per cent cheaper according to a current study in Germany. 
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have got more favorable again, this is the result of a study of the journey and financial service provider American Express. 
The enterprise has analyzed its booking data from the first six months of 2008 and established a clear burglary after a rising of the prices in the first quarter in the second quarter. 
After the prices have increased on the hotel market for years, the overnight stays have already become cheaper in many places. 
The prices in 41 still increased by on an average 6.9 per cent from 48 examined European towns from January until March in comparison with 2007. 
However, the prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year from April until June. 
Most considerably has been the trend in Paris and Rome where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 per cent less as a year before. 
As a reason for it American Express sees the weak dollar exchange rate which has led to a relieving "travel urge" of American tourists. 
Financial centers like Frankfurt or London are also concerned by the fall in the hotel prices more strongly than industry locations like Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
The hotel prices hold even the record with an increase in 26.3 per cent in the Norwegian town in Europe. 
The trend still pointed up also at the airfares in the first quarter: 
Because of the kerosene price increase, in the cut, travelers had to pay in the economy class 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, fuel intensive long-distance flights got even up to 29.2 per cent more expensive. 
The prices for plane tickets of the economy class dropped by on an average 12.5 per cent in comparison with the previous quarter from April until June, the price changes were, however, far more minor in the business and roof ridge Class. 
The prices collapsed in Germany still more strongly than in other European countries: 
The prices had increased by 11.9 per cent from January until March, in the second quarter they dropped by 23.6 per cent. 
The prices even have halved themselves according to the study on German domestic flights. 
The enterprise explains reason for the collapse of prices is on the one hand the economic growth falling off. 
The demand in many segments of the flight market crumbles. 
On the other hand there is an increased competitive pressure by the Open-Skies agreement which decontrols the air traffic between the USA and Europe. 
The cut unprofitabler ways for Airlines as well as the high number of the airline companies which would have declared themselves bankrupt in the first six months of 2008 is sign of the tense situation, these were alone in Europe for 24 airline companies.
