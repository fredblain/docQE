House-building associations see B & B costs in the eye 
House-building associations could stand British into the house after the rescue of the Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than 80 million pounds. 
The government made 14 billion pounds available to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers. 
The interest for this loan which gets money of investors, inclusive of the 59 property companies, is paid by all enterprises 
The president of the union of the house-building associations (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was unbearable "" that the societies and their members must pay. 
Loan will be at long last repaid to 14 billion if Bradford & Bingleys loans are paid off this. 
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is imputed to the 700 finance enterprises every year which accept deposits. 
The program to the compensation of financial services confirmed opposite the BBC that the 59 house-building associations are contained in this number. 
It is bitter that these have those institutions behaved circumspectly, ... being now called to take on some of the costs of the institutions which were far less circumspect.

It said, that every enterprise in proportion to the deposits which it would hold, must pay and that the societies must pay about 18% of the costs together. 
The Treasury guesses that the interest for the loan on 450 million pounds in the year 2009 will amount. 
This means that the societies must obtain 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, the president of the union of the house-building associations, informed the BBC that he thinks that this is unfair. 
It is bitter that want to those institutions these behaved circumspectly, to bear some of the costs of the institutions which were far less circumspect have called now during the property upswing. 
The BSA isn't according to failed society since the existence of the notes in the year 1945. 
"We will watch all aspects of this thing over the next weeks to see which alternatives there are to protect house-building associations and their members of possibly considerable costs." 
The interest which gets due in 2009 covers this off year by the end of March the seven months of the end of September. 
In the year 2010 interest gets due for a whole year and this almost could be twice as many. 
Since property companies are mutual organizations without companions, their members will have to pay for the costs by either higher charges or lower interest on savings accounts.
