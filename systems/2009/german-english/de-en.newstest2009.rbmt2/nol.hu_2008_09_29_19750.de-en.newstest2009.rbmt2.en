CSU: Mercy for a limited time 
You decide about the destiny of the pleased duo Huber-Beckstein at the end of October 
No heads roll despite the choice debacle in the meantime yet, the staff debates were adjourned at the head of Bavarian CSU. 
Party leader Erwin Huber and governor Beckstein still stay in their offices, the question only is how long this mercy lasts. 
The destiny of the tandem after the disastrous 17 per cent voting loss is decided on at the extraordinary party convention at the last October weekend. 
However, the duo scolded much had already been getting it, that it wouldn't like to stick on her armchairs. 
They want to calm down the annoyed parliamentary group and the grass-roots which demanded personal consequences after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority a day with that. 
The Christian social union still reached 60.7 per cent five years ago, admitted under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber being at his career highlight. It could secure only 43.4 per cent of the voices now though, a year after the revolt against Stoiber. 
For 46 years, CSU was "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria which gains 18 per cent of the German GDP. 
The conservatives remain the defining strength in the southern federal state also important to the Hungarian economy, however, will have to rule in a coalition in future. 
As the first sign of the internal party restructurings the potential successor Hubers, vice-president and federal agrarian secretary Horst Seehofer also is tied into the reconnaissance team which helps "free voter" orientated towards the right exploratory talks over a possible Munich coalition with a liberal FDP or this one. 
It comes an irony of destiny at once around then that the determined politician that Gabriele Pauli gets in to the legislation with the list "free voters", the anti Stoiber's appearance the Huber-Beckstein has made use of duo first merciless abzuservieren. 
The CSU leadership concentrates all its strengths on the stabilization Becksteins now. 
In this transition process an active role will befit Stoiber who pulled the threads out of the background till now. The former governor and CSU chairman called September 28th this one "bitterest day of his political career". 
On Monday Huber made a couple of poisonous remarks in the direction of CDU -- in his opinion CSU would have earned far more support of the sister party. 
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel. 
If CSU which has contributed much to the success also at a national level in 2005 should be put not again with a common show of strength on the legs, Merkel cannot become a chancellor after the parliamentary elections again in September 2009. 
Merkel who hasn't made any secret out of her disappointment about the fiasco thinks that the land loss of CSU won't have an effect on the large coalition in Berlin negatively. 
What is relative, though? Wounded CSU won't more easily have to be ruled and the crisis of the social democrats goes on meanwhile. 
With 18.6 per cent SPD obtained its till now best result in Bavaria since 1946.
