Can lead to permanent hearing damages to hear loud music with portable music equipments, like e.g. Mp3 player, over a longer period of time. 
This reports the European Commission which quotes the EU the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee about the current one and health risks recently identified) in a report distributed in Brussels today. 
"From the report? it is called that way in a remark? 5-10 % get, clear that the ones who listen to loud music with portable music equipments, risk the durable loss of their hearing for at least five years weekly longer than an hour on the day ". 
I worry so Meglena Kuneva without knowing it irretrievably damage such a large number of teenagers who put normally portable music equipment and mobile telephones on a high volume, their hearing, ", that ". 
"From the scientific results? it is called that way on the part of the Eu? a clear risk which is pressing to a fast behavior lets itself be seen. 
What really counts, it is to sensitize the consumers and to make this information about common property. 
We must check the control systems already existing in view of this scientific knowledge again so that they are completely effective and hold step with the new technology ". 
Brussels had engaged the independent scientific committee in view of the common use of the portable music equipments under teenagers. 
The communication of the EU excludes " the scientists -- - confirm that one is got rightly and that the Eu commission will examine the necessary measures together with the other Eu members and the things concerned now to be able to protect children and teenagers better from the noise which comes from portable music equipments and similar equipment " so. 
A European norm which limits the standard of the noise of portable music equipments on 100 dB already exists at the moment. The anxiety about the damages which could come from a too large noise load. 
One can delimit these damages very much, in which one reaches for solutions like the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise abandonment. 
In its report the scientific committee shows the Eu, that at this these are regarded, if the users of portable music equipments listen to loud (loud than 89 decibels) music only five hours the week, regarding the maximum noise level at the job so that the legal limits are already exceeded. 
Those, the music exceed this limit risk the complete loss of the hearing within of five years. 
So this would concern 5-10 % of the users of such equipment whose number can open be valued between 2.5 and 10 million persons in the Eu.
