In Mexico and without 'peep-toes' 
The airplane of the Spanish air force landed presidential hangars of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF, with this prince and princess von Asturien traveled with British punctuality at 5:40 p.m. around the time which was provided by the program besides which. 
The sun went down but its beams still have forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple who got off the airplane. 
At directly this gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities 
I had a couple asked a taxi-driver in the street hours before it whether he knew that the prince and the princess of Asturien went to the town to formalize the official journey. 
Very well, so, Ah, one can isn't people mitnehmen.Sie of hier.oder so at the airport around this time there. 
No, she is the Spaniard but she has lived a couple here years. 
Oh so, very good-. 
But the Mexican press knows quite exactly the prince and the princess of Asturien who are and know the importance of the journey. 
Many which wait in the hangar of the airport and at the red carpet are also armed forces protection of 27 soldiers of the navy who hand in honor salvo. 
The prince seems smiling, it the princess dressedly was informed about to her in navy blue and her with long hair blown by the wind without ordinary 'peep-toes' perhaps that a thunderstorm in DF is expected. 
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, in this the official retinue waits. 
A reporter of the Mexican television who likes to make jokes waits for her at the door of the hotel in which they are put, one of the four greatest in the town.
