Psychology of outbidding or why we are ready to pay more 
At auctions the buyers tend to distribute more and the offered for sale to overvalue therefore. 
Neurologists and economy researchers of the university of New York have managed to discover the neurological economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior now. 
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine the people want to act not beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and therefore are ready even to pay excessive prices. 
The researchers have tried to find out the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions. 
National lottery should play a group of the volunteers while the other one was taking part in a playful action, in the two cases the active brain regions of the experimentees were examined by means of a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). 
At the two games the participants could win money, one became increased activity of the Striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, though, measured in terms of with losers of the auction for this one an essential role plays outbidding the opponent. 
Besides many other functions this brain region is responsible "alone for" the reward of the nervous system. 
The researchers therefore thought the price increase could be explained by the avoidance of an overreaction of the Striatums. 
To support their thesis, the economists have made examinations for the backtracing of the money in addition in the researcher group. 
In this case three groups should against a partner under different conditions con-bidding. 
The control group the true value of the product was informed about, after that they have made to their uses. 
Furthermore 15 dollars became reward promised another group in case they result as winners from the game. 
The third group got 15 dollars before the auction which also were lost in the case of a lost game. 
So the difference between the two groups consisted merely that lay the emphasis unites on winning this one, lasting at the other one on losing. 
However, the members of the group playing "against losing" were ready for higher uses hypothesis expressed by neurologists as a proof for it than that one in the Kontroll or the "profit" group. 
"These results cannot be derived from any earlier economic theory. 
These have justified the behaviors watched at auctions namely only with the joy at winning or the risk avoidance till now. 
The inconsistency between these two theories was resolved thanks to the picture giving neurological methods so that we have a third explanation readily now " -- Andrew meant gravel, professor of the economy faculty of the university of New York.
