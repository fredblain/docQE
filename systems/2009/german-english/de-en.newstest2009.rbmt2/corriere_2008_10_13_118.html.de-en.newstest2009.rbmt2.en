This one rounds up the super adhesive, to walls 
The strengths to defeat the gravity thanks to an adhesive and walls hochklettern to be able to do like Superman. 
This is the object of four American research centers of which one has apparently arrived almost at the aim now. 
The researchers have managed with an adhesive found on an area of only 2.5 sq cm to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall. 
The studio? an American magazine the Georgia institutes has, has the results of the researchers of the university of Dayton, Akron, of Technology and the Air Force research Laboratory published. 
The material invented by the researcher team is which one carbon little nanotube a further development of the adhesives already used, called, use a special carbon structure. 
One can " the principle of the adhesive " imagine spaghetti of arranged tubes like a row to a stack, of Technology in Atlanta Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia institute itself explains. 
The scientists have themselves of the can be inspired feet of the geckos which are covered by microscopic little Hares who give the animal a perfect support. 
The tests carried out with different materials like glass of teflon and abrasive paper have so Liming Dai, researcher of the faculty for engineering sciences of the university of Dayton, "has removed without problems from the wall" shown as the hold ability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time that the new adhesive is stronger ten times. 
To walls ENTLANGWANDERN? This material could be used as transitory adhesive " ", Liming Dai adds. 
Approximately around as Spiderman on walls emporzugehen? Perhaps spare but the researchers rather think of a less fascinating use, such as the connection of electrical equipment, because the little nanotubes are as well leaders of warmth and electricity. 
Wider application areas could fall to the area of the space-travel. 
For the moment, so the super heroes still must wait. 
The other manner of the research? the university of Berkeley, California, also devotes itself to a new adhesive type. 
In an article of the American Chemical Society the Californian scientists present an adhesive these clean themselves like hair by movement on a surface from the dust and through this maintain always a perfect liability of micro fibers.
