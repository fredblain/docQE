My sister, both is also I of the cinema the 50 he and 60 he fascinated years; we find many ideas there. 
I go through a town and watch women, how they are dressed, how they combine their garments, I often do this with pleasure. 
Are you a very versatile woman dancer, actress and fashion-designer, isn't that right? 
I think yes but after all everything meets in one and these areas have many things in common. 
I was small since this, I was enthusiastic about the clothes; I wanted always to go to my grandmother to rummage and see her clothes in the clothes cupboards of my aunt. 
This was incredibly, almost better but to go to an amusement park. 
Already later, I tried always as a dancer to pay attention to the clothes. 
Yes, you know how to have a style characteristic we dancers like it so much of ours in lessons and at the tests to mirror look into it and feel good. 
If one gets the outfit, one gives himself actress in the actual actor role as. 
Everything finally gets connected to each other, it is that way, a lot of respect for the outfit designer and their professionalism.

You keep in it what the cinematic art concerns, eyes so the work at which you have taken part and which was turned last year. 
Exactly so this is and I would like very much that they are presented to the public. 
I as a woman who comes from the theater am very impatient and restless and want to have everything suddenly which of course cannot immediately be. 
I wish very much that be listed for the first time 'La última hora' ' //de// La tumba //de// En busca and ' Cristo. 
Seeing how you like them. 
Days, in front of a couple have you appeared on the Laufstieg with Naomi Campbell, is this correct? 
Yes, is good, don't say to something like that. 
It isn't so that I went on the Laufstieg around change. 
Naomi Campbell whom I have known for some time has simply called and invited to London me to take part in a parade for the Wohltätigkeitveranstaltung of her organization 'women for a better world' and the clothes which we show. I know that two garments were auctioned from our collection for mango to collect the money for Naomis NGO. 
The people don't know Naomi's good heart. 
Many are told to things about her. I as the one which she knows would tell you that they aren't correct. 
I will nevertheless support this good thing in which she is involved. 
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous thing but, if she comes to and asks me to make a handstand, I also will do this. 
To support the women in the third world what is also necessary?
