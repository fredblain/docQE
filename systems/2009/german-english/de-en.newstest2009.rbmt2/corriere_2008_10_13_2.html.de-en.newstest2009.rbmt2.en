The economy Nobel prize is Paul Krugman to the American for its analysis of trade samples and the settlement of economic activities. 
The 55 years old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer, which teaches at university of Princeton and noted for its regular articles for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of the economy and Aussenpolitik of the Bush administration. 
Krugman had claimed in a lead the New York Times a few months after the stops of September 11th, 2001 during the days of the Enron collapse this second event has been more decisive for the history of the USA than the assassinations. 
A forecast which which didn't receive little polemics as an answer and the economist still was reproached for years later, proves to be completely right today, however. 
"I am surprised and also shocked about this, how shoots the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or WorldCom has disappeared from the public field of vision", explained Krugman end 2002. 
An "economist of great value" is worth Krugman according to the Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, but also a Banalisierer with a "very aggressive style which is particularly aimed at the excessive liberalism of the Bush government".
