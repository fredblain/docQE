Liberal opinion, Orwell's talk of Barrick gold 
In her version of September 17th Le Devoir published a letter of Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. 
This confirms and the largest gold extraction company of the world one of Orwell's logics pursues that a little publishing house without means strove for a slander action more than six million against three authors and one with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'. 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they don't judge the truth primarily not in the case of slander actions but the law. 
As expected this basic difference was hidden by Mr Garver completely. 
Because for Barrick gold the best way to lead a public debate to drive everybody into the ruin which dares to hold an opinion set against hers is. 
Identically the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will as the process ends spend considerable sums, these must to prepare their defense and fight with very dissimilar weapons against an army of advocates be paid to the gold mine from the almost inexhaustible bags. 
The tactics at these dissimilar fights are as for the rest often to ruin the defenders to force a conjoint regulation which the opposite side silences and everybody in addition deters, which dares to deal with the question once more. 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public debate, it ought to have presented its view of the things with the public opinion. 
What unlike this and would pass through, into much the countries walk in which Barrick gold works are, debates are usually delivered by the exchange of ideas and not by stick strokes in Canada. 
So it would have sufficed by the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent examining teams which could have brought light in this question if the gold mine had disclosed her books and files and opened an actual debate. 
But Barrick gold doesn't seem to have confidence in the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to the support of the authors of Noir Canada with a gesture aside. 
Perhaps could Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate simultaneously and the opinions just disregard for this public really? 
This word apparently contains only the generously paid advocates and not the community of all Canadians in the world of the vice-president; a quite beautifully cramped position of the concept. 
Slanderers have the right in a democracy to speak themselves. 
What Barrick gold doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand are that the public which supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada primarily therefore does this because it declines the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments and many are aware of it not in a frame as a gag complaint (Barrick gold hasn't judged a demand on the authors of Noir Canada, in which asked it of them in the course 'of the public debate', this concept, just any more to put ...). 
Refrained from the surreal talk by Mr Garver the complaint is a direct attack on the liberty for the academic research and the establishment of the truth of Barrick gold which are basic every democratic society. 
She denies completely the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations which form the base of the intellectual work. 
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to investigate and to discuss topics which the rich enterprises of this world don't like, otherwise who can do this then? 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead these by following the scientific norms which were used by Noir Canada of the authors. 
She has a right to answer. 
For a long time, the universitäre environment to which we belong has known how to get a grip on debates and discrepancies and to solve conflicts. 
The unverhältnismäßige complaint of Barrick gold shows clearly that it doesn't feel like a transparent debate unlike what it provides. 
This is a loss for the university world, just like for the public debate and it becomes time that the governments take up measures which limit this type of unjustified complaints.
