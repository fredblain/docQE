The USA. The financial collapse leaves its traces also with journalists: One can already feel the cuts in the newspapers. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press. 
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW research center about their situation and their mental control concerning the future. 
Today is what pessimistically concerns almost all journalists her future. 
They nevertheless didn't explain this one to responsible concerning the information really gottenly because of the general reliability opposite. 
You don't feel as alone as early. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 is a crisis of an economic model which was destroyed for these journalists. 
The great problems come added to that the Newsroom meeting cuts, that is the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper there. 
It is a problem which must be solved? interviewed these journalists so? if one wants to prevent that the traditional journalism doesn't shrink fundamentally as the large audience understands him. 
A clear but complicated pessimism fulfills the American journalist today. 
Six of ten journalists and Executive senior of the printing press are of the opinion that the journalism is national on standard on the wrong way. 
It is in the local area with the Executives even about 65%. 
Printed vs. broadcast. 
It isn't difficult for the journalists to imagine in which direction the web goes. 
The most important publishing house groups force the way to the Internet which is seen in the printing press by many as the "killer". 
The "economic pressure" which the journalists feel has increased by up to 79%. 
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted in the hope to want to follow the new technology "it takes something good for the journalism". 
Today, the greatest rip consists in the American journalism between the editor-in-chiefs of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of the editor-in-chiefs are sure, their reporters share their values with them on national standard while it is merely 23% at a local level. 
Some think it has with the "certainty in the work" to work. 
The works managers who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at a national level. 
With the journalists it is 30%. 
The topic of the "safe work" in the team talk (.) . "our editors, note" this a current theme always is in the USA. 
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. 
They wish and it becomes a question of take it or leave it so in a gigantic nation as these are the USA with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers offer the employers like it to magazines, radio and TV transmitters and Internet operators. 
The editor-in-chiefs very often get very high pay, pensions and insurance monies the editor however can get only 10000 euros per month occasionally to it. 
The thing concerns what the vacation, gets complicated so: crowd determined in the first year, so and so many after the third one on days to finally after a certain number of years reach 15 holidays a. 
But the American journalists frequently will in the course of the year "illy" as they themselves admit. 
It is a question of the climate.
