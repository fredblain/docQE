Discussion got sure -- of the blood, that again 
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks of the world. 
And she has primarily recovered the confidence of the public which had deeply been shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood within the 1980s and 1990s years. 
As one knows, the national blood reserves managed by the donation of blood service of the Canadian red cross were contaminatedly hepatitis C virus with the hi virus and this during the 1980s years. 
In the face of this drama and the discontent of the public the government of Canada started an examination in February 1994 which is public and escorted by the judge Horace Krever which aimed to take light to the circumstances which had led to such a tragedy and to work out guidelines to prevent a renewed catastrophe of this type. 
At that time, while judge Krever still was hesitating to hand in his report, several provinces adjusted a committee to the legs whose aim it was to develop a new system for the administration of blood preserved foods in Canada. 
The committee fulfilled Gélineau this order in Quebec. 
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec which is responsible for Quebec and the Canadian blood company, provide around the other provinces and the two territories. 
'1998 when Hema-Quebec has taken her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood preserved food system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers. 
The situation was discouraging. 
It says before it emphasizes proudly that almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec at the beginning of 2008 meanwhile won back to improve the safety of the blood preserved foods and we have the confidence of the public by the work in this field during the following years by the enormous efforts '. 
Dr. Décary keeps, however, that ' a little extremely fragile in the consciousness confidence is '. 
Since its foundation on September 28th, 1998 Hema-Quebec acts according to the principle of the caution. 
We saw the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of the Mad Cow Disease, a new nature of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob illness, in Europe at that time, this woman who holds the line since the foundation in 1998 says. 
'And we didn't have the slightest idea whether this illness over the blood could be transmitted. 
Therefore we referred to one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau according to which one uses exclusion measures if one doesn't know this and if an illness progresses only slowly as obviously it is the case at the Creutzfeldt-Jakob illness which speaks by a degeneration of the brain what inevitably leads to death. 
Therefore one didn't accept blood of persons who had stayed in the United Kingdom longer than a month since 1980 in April 1999. 
Well, it was proved some years ago without any doubt that this illness over the blood is transmitted. 
So the principle of the caution has shown us this event that has, the used, absolutely a meaning. 
A much more exact technology turned up for the reconnaissance of HIV on the market in 1999: At the tests used till now how it was the case the nucleid acid tests (NST) which make it possible to prove the occurrence of the virus itself in the blood of the donator directly and not that one of the antibodies against the virus. 
The NST made it possible these between the time, to shorten the incubation period to which the person was infected and this, if the first viruses can be proved by our techniques in the blood, takes place, explains the specialist. 
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week. 
So became the risk that certain donators could be infected without knowing it and one couldn't recognize this, reduced fundamentally. 
These improvements made it possible to reduce the risk in considerable measure of transferring AIDS about a blood transfusion. 
Nowadays one runs the risk of from 12 million persons getting blood infected with HIV. 
'With other words this means that one must distribute 12 million blood preserved foods before somebody would be infected with HIV. 
Since Hema-Quebec distributes every year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preserved foods, it would last more than 24 year before a case appears, was transferred at the HIV about a blood preserved food. 
I think that nowadays one can feel comfortable with if one gets a blood transfusion or prescribes to restore the health ', the management boss of Hema-Quebec thinks. 
'It is our challenge for the next ten years to get the safety of our products. 
One never knows which pathogene can reach the system. 
Only last year the Chikungunya virus which is transmitted by insects over the blood just like the Westnil virus has appeared on the island of Réunion. 
We must supervise ', incessantly Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec in addition must provide a sufficient supply besides a safe supply. 
'The need increases because the population ages. 
Since the treatments are more aggressive for the cancer fighting the patients often need new red blood corpuscles or blood small plate. 
The increase in the percentage of old people of the population also has an effect on the blood donor net, to this on average only 3% suitable this one to this donations of blood inhabitants of Quebec belong. ' 
Every healthy person can, the 18 years or is older and the suitability criteria satisfies, everyone donates blood to 56 days therefore six times in him year. 
On average 14% of the persons who make their blood available are adopted not because they have fallen ill with AIDS or malaria, for example and who has traveled to a country, malaria is common in it, donations of blood get impossible for a year of this. 
'With these 3% we manage to get an inventory which corresponds to the needs of the hospitals. 
Lacking stocks are very rare. 
But one must replace the members of this donator net if they can get older and donate no more blood. 
It is primarily but, hard to convince people to donate blood think them and get them to become regular donators. 
Nowadays the life is so hectic that one seldom finds to spend donations of blood an hour the time ', Francine Décary is sorry. 
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars Hema-Quebec doesn't deliver only blood preserved foods but also human fabrics among this bone transplants, cardiac valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively at heavy fire injuries. 
These fabrics are examined, treated and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank of Quebec. 
Rich blood is to stem cells which can serve to treat serious illnesses, such as leukemia, in the umbilical cord who was regarded as a biomedical waste earlier. 
'Some weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood test and we plan to remove more than one thousand every year. 
Dr. Décary further explains 'we should start well at the beginning of next year to make it available' for transplants, which when very popular describes this program the umbilical cord blood removal. 
Many mothers 'are' convinced to not have access to it in all hospitals of Quebec offer because Hema-Quebec lacks the means, this complex and costly program.
