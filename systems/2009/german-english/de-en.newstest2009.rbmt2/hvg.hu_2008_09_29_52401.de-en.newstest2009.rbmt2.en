Do believers of few pains have? 
How latest research results prove that the religious faith like a way works "painkiller" which shall already have made the death of Roman Catholic martyrs easier. 
Scientists the Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: The British sheet of "telegraph" reported it was examined, how far the faith in God influences the Schmerzempfinden of man. 
In the course of the rather bizarre examination 12 believers and each atheists received electric shocks while they were studying a painting of the mother of God. 
How the results pointed, the believers could turn the large part of the pains off. 
Brain scan technology even could be proved means of one, that the Roman Catholics could activate the part of their brain which is responsible for the pain regulation. 
The examination was the first one in a research project in which philosophers and theologians of different departments of the university also take part next to scientists. 
At the test a scintillating device which handed in the electric shocks was tied for the experimentees to the left hand. 
The participants were asked to concentrate on two paintings strongly: On the one hand a picture of the mother of God painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "lady with the ermine". 
The researchers hoped that the sight of the virgin would call Maria under the believers a kind of religious trance to come out while she was since Vincis selected picture, because it was hardly different from the other painting and when calming being found. 
Spent the test subjects in a MRI scanner one half hour each and altogether 20 electric shocks got in four stages at this time while they should look at either the religious or the other painting. 
The Roman Catholics reported they would have felt at the sight of the mother of God "into safety" as if they were "looked" and they would have felt "quiet and peace". 
They have reported about 12% less pain during looking at the religious painting as if they had Leonardo's work ahead of eyes. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also took part in the test thought one also could cause similar effects with the atheists also with pictures which are other and seeming strong, one merely must find the corresponding photo. 
"We should find a picture which arouses very positive feelings such as a mother or a father", so the psychologist. 
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
"The practice the faith should change our personality and does it in many cases, too", so Wright. 
After these excellent results the question which effect a Madonna picture of Leonardo or one of other comparable painter on the pain regulation of the believers had only remains. 
Would the high-quality virgin Maria achieve even better results?
