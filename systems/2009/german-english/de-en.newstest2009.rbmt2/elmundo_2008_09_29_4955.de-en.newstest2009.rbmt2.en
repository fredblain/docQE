The best quality of the fashion 
There probably was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present the fashion a quality and there were probably no fashion-designer jutting out fundamentally and Bonvivanten as Valentino. 
Mango presents the second version of the fashion competition 'tbsp of Bóton mango Fashion Adwards' for the support and international increase of young fashion talents. 
This is honored with cash prize in the amount of 300 000 euros. 
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first version, have yesterday seen Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement her drawings in the shopwindow of the mango branch office on boulevard. 
This by the way is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a selling space of 1 335 m ². 
The largest business is in London. 
So many events which are connected to that have happened that one would like to thank the fashion-designer Valentino for his jury chairmanship at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner into Opera National de Paris. 
The executive board table which was organized by mango seemed to the surroundings of many famous people to be spectacular. 
Which one of the pain, Nati, with the heavy heart was tear himself together broken because its brother recently died? He has put the suit of the fashion house on and had some jewelry things of ELAH which were breathtaking on. Held on to the arm of his son Luis, this one is almost two meters in size and has Valentino at the dinner, accompanies honors to his. 
Andik, the owner and sir of the house mango, welcomed the guests and was such a gentleman so that it ended together with the baron of red signpost without jackets because jackets have lent them to the ladies. 
They have hurried to the business, Mónica Cruz, and had trousers which modeled them themselves and a shirt on and for the dinner wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk by the opera accompanied by Goya Toledo they showed us a hall for ballet tests, they have got into excitement, remembered the old days, a bar gripped and made a kind of 'grand plie' that way. 
Didn't follow the walk, Inés Sastre, by the premises of the palace but in front of that she had shown us the photos of her son on the mobile telephone. 
In the next morning we could be pleased about the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always arouses a stormy enthusiasm, and on Jon Travolta (with bed varnishes of our own and towels) in the hotel Internacional in Paris, this one after his arrival has to have a room without smells asked in advance. 
The stars under the starfull sky of Paris. 
The life Laly oh indeedly is that way.
