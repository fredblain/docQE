Debate around a bilingual education: Education in English-speaking surroundings 
In this version of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates to the bilingual education. 
Leading scientific employee in Kalifonischen studies and leading director in the school education sciences at the Pacific research institute for PUBLIC Policy, Lance T. Izumi, a co-author of the book is " not thinks as well as one: Why the middle classes need a school choice ". 
It is a complicated task to appeal to the Hispanic voters. 
Barrack Obamas suggestions to the education topic are a typical example of it. 
Obamas election campaign mentions, " the probability to lock the school with afro American and Hispanic pupils successfully, this is lower than with white pupils " -- what is correct. 
To close this performance distance, Obamas education plan recommends a bilingual transitional phase especially under others in the education for those which first learn English. 
The question to Obama nevertheless consists, whether its use contradicts its interest for the bilingual education which puts the main emphasis on lessons in other languages than English to reduce the distance in the school performances. 
We take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", an elementary school in the eastern Los Angeles. 
Are the majority of the pupils Hispanic and come from families with a low income. 
More than a third party of the pupils from whom many are in the country only for a short time learn English. 
There has nevertheless existed the state examination on a good standard in 2008 astonishing one 100 per cent pupils of the fourth class in math. 
93 per cent of the children were also surprisingly judged from the fourth school year in the English examination when good. 
This astonishing success was achieved with other methods as those which are preferred by Obama. 
The school Sixth Street puts its main emphasis on check and exercise on steady control of the knowledge and an attitude which doesn't tolerate any exceptions. 
Furthermore the school practices the approach according to which the education goes in English-speaking surroundings. Exactly this is the point which Obama shall take into account, so the principal Linda Mikels. 
This approach attaches importance to the almost ausschliesslichen use of the English language in the subject lesson. 
The idea more bilingually education declines, said to me Mrs Mikels, this one the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil who had come from Mexico only shortly before this. 12 months later one would be able to enter the classroom and to not recognize it any more. 
"It works", she said, "it works for us". 
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with great share in Latin American and other pupils learning English? 
The performances of the school would make the answer to this question easy but the politico-educational positions within its own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support the idea of bilingual education already for a long time) and its own consistent support of the bilingual education make forecasts answer uncertain over Obamas. 
While he is agreing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently has the trivialisiert topic by saying that people should stop, worries over these make a transitive legislation to themselves in "only English". 
He said instead: "You shall make sure that your child can speak Spanish". 
If Obama wants to close the performance distance actually, it shall carefully take into account education models which work instead of disdaining them and to trivialisieren.
