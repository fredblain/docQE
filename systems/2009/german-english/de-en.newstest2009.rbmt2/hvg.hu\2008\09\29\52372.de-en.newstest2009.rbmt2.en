What was produced to the invoice factory of surcharge &amp;? Co.? 
The negotiations start in the criminal proceeding against János surcharge and its accomplices on October 8th. 
Particularly the participation in the organized crime as well as roughly negligent damage and business deceit and other punishable offences is the defendant document fake -- among other things -- reproached. 
According to the prosecuting attorney's office these were used from the advertisings lukrierten remedy for purposes of one's own while the rendered services were often covered with forged invoices. 
Governmental monies and subsidies of the self-administration shall hoof 65 m. partly into the registers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal -- altogether -- , partly into the private registers single have flowed. 
As the offices of investigation announced, fictitious invoices were presented when obtaining the advertising monies and the organizations shall not have complied with their duties either. 
According to the indictment a large part of the invoices shall have been falsified. 
The invoice blocks were bought by Józsefváros on the market, one had made the full seals in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision on what the invoices shall be issued to companies was decided by Lake Balaton on that tour north on which István Lados was sent by János surcharge. 
In the course of this "reconnaissance tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants. 
He required invoices about the Konsumationen to be able to issue invoices for the youth and sports department, the social and Department of Labor as well as the self-administration of Budapest based on these presentations later. 
These invoices shall by the majority of István Lados and its accomplice, András?have ri been manipulated in which the latter shall have been responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports according to our information. 
One of the aims of Lados "reconnaissance tour" was a beer restaurant. 
As two of surcharge and co. has to be taken in 2003 issued invoices, the catering trade business shall have fed the ninety-headed group of the organization Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
The boss of the business says now, however, such a large group wouldn't have fitted into the restaurant suddenly. 
Another invoice have a job, exhibited in summer 2002 on the foundation?Jöv ért also showed serious form and contents faults, later than Együtt are Harmadik Évezredért, confessed. 
Being supposed to have held back themselves 130 guests as per account in a pension in Badacsonytomaj which has three rooms merely and can't house simultaneously any more than ten persons. 
No limits were apparently just sedately, as it the imagination of the invoice forgers around the Pigal Kft. Jöv went in the accounting documents of the customers ért and Hoppá according to the District Attorney on not only at all bills have a job?, a catering trade business. 
As managing director Gy?z? Informed Farkas of the hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to it that it was forged documents when documents were presented to it of the prosecuting attorney's office during an interview. 
"Our company name and the taxpayer identification code were attached wrongly on the stamp". 
And: Except for flaws the fact was also wrong that the business shall have housed one hundred persons after they have altogether eleven rooms which offer by no means so many persons place. 
The restaurant also has been led on the invoice catering, is no more into business for quite a long time. 
Verabsäumt also have to check that the Budapest travel agency taken by them into the visor exclusively offers journeys abroad and the busy invoice forgers they have said Hungary journeys on the cash payment invoice so what also contradicted to the accounting practice of the company. 
As you confessed in the course of the inquiries, furthermore they also have led the value added tax on the invoices although travel agency performances which refer to a country outside the EU are vat-exempt. 
Altogether, the amount of the value added tax was on four of the hotel Révfülöp Kft. Jöv have a job to the foundation?invoice issued to ért are issued by the employees exclusively machine invoices wrongly, the forged documents were, however, handwritten, in addition, since the business settles VAT instead of 25 only 15 per cent. 
The prosecuting attorney's office informed this one was another mistake which the "Rechnungslegern" had made that they had indicated in a case "goods transport" as a rendered service although this isn't offered by the company specialized in investment advice. 
Was thanks to broader flaws, wrong invoice format, wrong stamp, that these to Együtt are Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány as well as to XXI. Invoices issued to Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont as fakes could be exposed. 
As well in the case of the Ravenna Bt. and the sports store Kunfehértó whose managing directors declared to have never issued the invoices. 
A different one "fault" is for the forgers at the HIB Kft. got from Nyíregyháza: At the moment, this society just was (2001) namely in dissolving when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület shall have eaten there, the mass administrator claimed consequently to have issued not the invoices. 
Consciously forged 
Persons to whom it was definitely conscious that fictitious invoices must put them are the invoice casual the other group. 
On requests of the Fiatal Baloldal -- Ifjú Szocialisták has the foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány invoices for the foundation Együtt are Harmadik Évezredért, issued to 4 m. in a height of approximately hoof. 
According to the indictment the managing director became the Collab Kft. talked into the exhibition of the fictitious invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi. 
The Biogate Kft at the moment also situated in liquidation. shall have cooperated also with surcharge and co.: The GmbH shall in 2003 the foundation have a job Jöv?ért Alapítvány as well as the organizations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny? Having Egyesület provided 5 m. in the total value of hoof with forged invoices which referred to not rendered services. 
However, payment transactions admitted it make a note just as little since the invoices were immediately canceled after their exhibition what the persons affected have forgotten, however, in their documents. 
The invoice casually contains persons the third group who are immediately taken to connection with the defendants. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman the Ukrainian managing director the delta Trió Kft ., an in Budapest resident, there however not traceable fuel and vehicle trade company. 
This company shall have issued several invoices to about 18 m. about the sale of EDP components in the total value of hoof in the period of October until December 2005. 
This one shall investment Kft according to the office of investigation into liquidation situated Cash since September 14th, 2005. having functioned as a buyer of these invoices from Kiskunhalas. 
Managing director of this company was a Romanian to whom the company documents also should be delivered by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information has Kubatov during the inquiries confessed, invoices in the name of the GmbH. having exhibited and collected the equivalent to the organizations Atlasz and Hoppá as well as to Együtt are Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány. 
The companies Fa ban Jos Faipari Kft. as well as these Jo investment Bt. shall from Romanian bricklayers on Iván Kubatovs express have wish been founded to. 
None of these companies, however, was active in truth which was due to lacking orders according to the defendant. 
He could nevertheless profit from the enterprises: He has issued to requests of his accomplice, the advocate Zsolt Szente who was engaged to do the preparations for the company formation documents, in the name of the companies invoices to the organizations taken to connection with surcharge such as to Atlasz and Y Generáció. 
Altogether, Kubatov 15 invoices shall have issued investment and Linaxtrade for 14.2 m. in the name of the companies' cash investment, delta Trió, Fa ban Jos, Jos in the total value of hoof to the organizations. 
The prosecuting attorney's office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% each of the invoice sum as well as the value added tax. 
Even the company Szi-Beri Bt shall Kubatov. having used for the exhibition of fictitious invoices, in this case the invoices were enclosed in the applications by Biztos Pont. 
Magyarországért have modernly given their applications at the charitable organization of the socialist party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA") to the company Y Generáció and Szövetség are in January 2006. 
Both 500,000 Forint each got, these amounts have, however, used misusedly. 
To hush this they have the TMA five fictitious invoices of the Works team Kft. presented. 
These invoices were guaranteed by the way by Árpád Kemecsei at the search of the office in the Ministry of Education. 
During the negotiations some defendants are calculating now with a confession about the procedure of the invoice fake as they were put down already in front of the prosecuting attorney's office. 
A sensation could be if the principal defendant János surcharge decides on a comprehensive confession. 
His previous details were namely less detailed and although he had accepted already repeatedly to report about everything comprehensively his confession is still due. 
So the question remains open whether this is in his interest whether this one 50 m. have into a pact entered with it regarding the compensation of the large part of the arisen damage of hoof and whether surcharge is ready in return to take on the responsibility for socialists. 
However, it is definitely possible that surcharge plays the "insulted" one now after its petitions for moderation of the detention had discovered numb ears. 
While other criminals which have caused far bigger damage and not compensated for these with economy crimes are standing on free foot or at least under detention surcharge remains this possibility refuses.
