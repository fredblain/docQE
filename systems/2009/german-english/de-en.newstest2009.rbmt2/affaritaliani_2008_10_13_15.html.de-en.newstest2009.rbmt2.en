Obama? the first anti American president? Here an explanation 
A well-known American politician has much lies but to be looked at independently written, this: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, this one by his decisions which decimated economy of the USA and which cultivated relations with the befeindeten Islam (and does this as a private individual certainly today), ". 
The attacks against Obama are getting still more intense, straight now where the elections approach. 
A lady from Miami has written in an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama is very impudent: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation which has seen altogether two black governors and five black senators!". 
Actually these attacks don't have to say a lot, however; it is racialist attacks and they don't answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the surveys, too; everyone says that Obama with a great lead will win. 
Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi in the deepest south of the United States has written in hers in the editorial: we will know only in the polling booth well whom the real American patriot will give his voice. 
Here a mentality of the USA appears, up to this one was held in secret lastly. 
"Say we will then decide what you want, for whom we will make our Kreuchen whether for Obama or for Mccain". 
It is people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America. 
What one a little never heard before? the success so surely seems the black candidate only now where. 
In all cases despite all these considerations the definite weapon for the democrats is George Bush. 
1500 persons were questioned: Which faults has Bush made during his period of office? 89% have answered: the war in Iraq. 
America changes. 
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick into the bottom again. 
In Iraq 4500 soldiers have lost their life and the Americans weren't forced to pack. 
Iraq nevertheless remains the weak point of Bush for the majority. 
The one who will take his job stands before a gigantic task.
