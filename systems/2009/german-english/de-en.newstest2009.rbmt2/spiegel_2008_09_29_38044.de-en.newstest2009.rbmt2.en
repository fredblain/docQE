Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, shall introduce itself at the Tachibana Highschool on the first schoolday, the girls begin to giggle: "Kawaii" is the Germans totally! 
What this means? 
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas -- it exchange-lied told in the new one of Japan. 
"The first schoolday in Japan. 
I was excited. 
I had Bammel already in front of the way to school. 
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of the Kawasaki and go to Tachibana Highschool by train 40 minutes. 
The way I had alone to think I fortunately haven't got lost. 
The lessons beginning seems not fixed at the Tachibana so strictly as in the case of us at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils spin, as of eight o'clock one a short meeting round starts with the teacher until twenty to nine, the 'Home room'. 
But before the lesson started it was my turn to introduce myself. 
I am not the type in front of a class to this from 40 pupils at all yet who likes to speak in front of people. 
Because I didn't have any school uniform yet I have an old skirt of my guest mother blouse, blue knee-socks and black leather shoes dressedly, to this. 
In this elevator I have so gone and in front of the desk stood and tried to say everything correctly: I Sayonara am called Sylvana, come from Germany and have in a week birthday ' where she Sylvana ... '. 
I was very glad at the moment that I had already begun more than two years ago to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class have whispered everyone, giggled and waved and I have heard the word "Kawaii" continually. 
I already knew this from my Mangas. 
It is part of the over-essential vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cutely, sweetly'. 
I then have darted fast onto my place. 
The girl next to me has grinned rather broadly, she found an honor that the exchange pupil should sit besides it. 
The rest of the hour was rather quiet anyway when the gong sounded I was bombarded really. 
Everyone talked at once and giggled and holes asked for me into the belly -- it is extremely hard to understand Japanese English. 
All its Bentos then unpacked in the break. 
My guest mother also had made such a Lunchbox to me -- this is something else than the deserted German somethings to eat at break. 
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. 
I usually don't have any pale glimmer what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
The things look strange and taste completely new. 
Tightly stands, that everything is extremely delicious. 
Naja, except for the plums marinated saltily perhaps, brrrr! 
The Bentos aren't only simply lunches at Japanese schools. 
Sometimes it happens in the hope to get to know the boy at the Pausensnack better that a girl gives a boy a Bento prepared which particularly artistically then gets it ready. 
Of this I have read in my Manga comic strips. 
I am curious whether I also can watch this here. 
Of all things Japan?mean friends asked, as me them told that I want to go in Tokyo to school for a year ' why because ', have me. 
I then have always said: 
"Because it fascinates me now." 
After all, I read best of all Mangas already for years. 
And, sometime, so that I understand the comic strips and the culture better, I have begun to study a bit Japanese, too. 
For me, so it was completely clear that I had to travel here sometime. 
Because I also have a liking for tradition and customs. 
One puts great value and on the here. 
Japan on the one hand is a country of the latest technologies and trends -- it is strict, disciplined and traditional on the other side. 
And because everything is organized so well, I have felt not lost here either even if Tokyo is the largest town which I have ever seen."
