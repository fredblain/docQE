An intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumble-bee 
What would be the best method for the development of new technologies to the accident avoidance, to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature if not? 
For example that one of the bees. 
An astonishing project at which the Nissan engineers were inspired by bumble-bees of systems avoiding accident more newly at the creation was introduced at the CEATEC in Japan. 
Nissan has equipped the biol mimetic system, a mini-car, steered by car robots of the type BR23C built in cooperation with the Tokyo university with the qualities of the bees to support the development of a system with the aim which avoids any collisions. 
Every bee forms its own, oval "private area" in the flight which is very similar to our own "shield", Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and development of the research, said at the exhibition. 
The combined eye of the bee which can see in every direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees plays an important role in this. 
To imitate the function of the combined eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser controlled distance knife. 
This identifies obstacles in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters in front of the BR23C, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board which immediately starts the collision avoiding process. 
The obstacle is registered in split seconds and the car robot immediately changes the course like the movement of the bees by turning the tires around the corresponding angle. 
Unlike previous systems this maneuver takes place purely instinctively. 
"If it weren't that way, the car robot couldn't react fast enough to evade the obstacles", explained Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the car robot project. 
The system must a layer within which accidents are at present still valid as inevitable react instinctively and immediately since this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield. 
The complete process must reflect the behavior of the bees if they make way for other bees. 
And this must go off in the fraction of a second. 
The alternative solution cannot be diagonally carried out up, down or even unlike the bees, though, it only can be two-dimensional and but only in the direction of the Wendbarkeit of the tires. 
While many possibilities are open to the bees here infinitely to make way for other bees, the researchers could make use of only the rotation or and of accelerating of braking at the car robot. 
The BR23C contains lithium Polymerbatterien which are easier and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life time lithium ion batteries when conventional. 
Andoh explained it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction and less on the processing of the data and still less on the ability to save these. 
This device must process merely some inputs and react to them correspondingly per second. 
This must not store or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using earlier maneuvers so that, constantly, it merely takes Memory a handful kb. 
It doesn't require any gigabyte and megabyte heavy Memories. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology which will be standard in production in assessment of Nissan within the next ten years. 
Further application could find the technology at the GPS satellite navigation by managing the driver around obstacles consciously and leading him to the aim so.
