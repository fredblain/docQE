Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy still will make an excursion to Brittany. 
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked the driveways to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday the French president decided to come in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday mornings to meet there the representatives. 
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he comes with 'concrete suggestions'. 
This one finds the visit of the president a record value instead of as a general meeting of the crisis committee which was founded by the Breton fishermen to succeed with measures in view of the extreme increase in the diesel price of has reached more than 1.14 euros per liter on an average at the same time.

The sail port of Quiberon also was blocked, the connections to Belle île, however, didn't break off. 
The peninsula Quiberon was fenced off with a lock. 
Already on Monday the sailors of their determination expressed by burning of the early morning to tires and pallets in front of the fuel depositories of the ports of Brest and Lorient while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint Brieuc. 
The movement expanded on other ports of the Atlantikküste and the Channel, such as Sables ' this where Olonnes didn't drive the fish cutters out in Vendée or where about twenty boats blocked, Le Havre, the maneuvers of the merchant ships. 
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique resolved the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges in the evening. 
These from Boulogne-sur Mer decided to wait in the department for the course of the meeting on Wednesday before they decide on possible measures. 
The crisis committee must actually decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in Guilvinec at the discussion planned in the department for farming and fishing in Paris. 
But some Breton fishermen don't claim to be deputized by the persons responsible of the national fishing committee which hasn't supported their movement. 
'The strike will go on' because the fishermen 'won't' give way in any point and 'don't want to go to Paris', announced Liliane Cariou, president of the fishing committee of Lorient, for example. 
Currently, the liter costs the professional fishermen whom no taxes pay on diesels about 50 cents but they think that the limit of profitability of a boat can be achieved only with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
