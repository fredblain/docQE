The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had revealed itself already some days ago when the representative chamber voted against the 700 billion dollar economy package of the White House: A tall portion of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street but to save the economy one. 
This confirms yesterday's version to the New York Times which reports how the crisis divides the republican party in the trot always more splits in its old and moderate East Coast soul, always and which business community favored this one the state institutions and that neon conservative, the and "these in Washington" the financial world hostilely contrasts and V . . are this one wins in the south and the center of the states of voter. 
This part of the party owes its advancement to V . are . the voice the one whom I mentioned above. 
This example just mentioned is only a small portion of the great changes meanwhile which the short-term economic earthquake announces or even already represents: wanting to be affected by these also beyond this in the complete west and perhaps not only in the USA. 
The crisis seems both in the states and in Europe to accelerate the events feared for a long time which take shape under these new conditions and come to the light. 
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the outrageous renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy. 
The crisis indeed means a decline of the bank and finance institutions which close connections to the foreign countries have and an enormous set of the fortunes of private households which live in one single state manages at the same time. 
This means an immediate political problem for the governments: one enormous voter mass yes also representing which ones namely as it is necessary to behave opposite the families concerned. 
So the crisis seems economically global, it is almost purely nationally political against this. 
The political internationalism seems to have advised to be and lost its talk right to himself so to the offside: The plausible evidence for it has been given by the EU which doesn't know how to find any common way due to its division in different national and international conflicts. 
Everyone therefore expects the intervention of the state of one's own now; Rescue plans, new rules and V . are . distribution of relief funds: Since the crisis got graver and graver, merely the USA are an economic situation in it to save himself without strange help. 
And furthermore they also have the identification besides the means to employ these: therefore two to not about judging prerequisites? otherwise to which ones will under certain circumstances?, be able no international organization and no market go back in a similar way well? 
That new stress which is put on the state national element is in a perfect harmony as for the rest with the bigger and bigger importance which is taken to connection recently with a sector put into the narrowest in the economy: the territoriality. 
More paradoxically it is way to have already just now when we were so convinced of it anyway entered a networked entire empire, to an empire of the always subtly differentiated technologies, the immaterial one that, suddenly, we must how our future will always depend on the essentially material things more anyway notice: Waters, harvest and oil. 
All these can be transported by a place to the different one of the world certainly, however, are connected nevertheless on outermost piece paraphrased narrowly with one earth? a territory. 
The one who has such a territory therefore is, a different one, opposite, which lives in a harvest unproductive, waterless or free of oil deposits area in the advantage. 
I come now to the second novelty which, however, presupposes a short slide-in unit. 
Government thus also tells Leadership who says politics whom territory, whom. 
In this sense seems the financial crisis to cause two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand is there knowing respected Leaderships around the necessity therefore the need for somebody who knows how one regulates the things. 
A wave of the indignation at the existing leaderships, V exists are on the other side . . now those the economy which have turned out to be insufficient and full of shade zones. 
Aspect sufficing more deeply a and worrying still in certain meaning finally joins: A confidence loss, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of the distance which all of them focuses on a whole class of managers of the western countries. 
It seems so the conviction under large portions of the population to itself to clear the way that it isn't first the deeds of the social elite but already its idea world, her Way of Life, its culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary appears to be more foreign to the majority as always and come. 
So the demand for Leadership nurses underground a branched but powerful movement of the deprivation of power of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the sudden reversal of the collective frame of mind of the last time: starting (and) perhaps the victory of the rightists also plays a role here in Italy with the advancement of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria about the collapse of the Labour party in Great Britain to for the rebellion of the American representative against Bush. 
One gains the impression when is this one has an old elite, its parties, its programs, but also its rites, magazines, intellectuals creditor, some still would say its format more and more, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value regarding this one, nowadays which goes in the lower social layers of the west in front of himself and of the financial crisis the Überdimensionalität and up to driven. 
It would have time face all this one simply exaggeratedly, of a rebellion "of the masses." 
Meanwhile, however, it for certain isn't to keep the eyes wide open.
