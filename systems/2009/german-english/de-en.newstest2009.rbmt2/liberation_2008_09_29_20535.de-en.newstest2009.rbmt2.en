'Have you remarked that a choice took place in Minsk?' 
Teenagers and opposition demonstrated evening on the main place of the Belorussian capital on Sunday to decline the results of the parliamentary elections already in advance. 
Some hundred White Russians assembled Sunday evening since shutdown of the polling stations on the market place of Minsk, to protest the deceitful character of the parliamentary elections. 
Although no result had been announced yet, numerous teenagers had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator shall step down'. 
Some admit that they haven't voted first at all: 'What uses what, if they make voices anyway with mine anyway, they want', says a teenager. 
You don't think that the regime which has shown itself to the foreign observers in the best light to resume the negotiations with the European Union is ready to perform a democratic turn. 
The sanctions, among this the Nichterteilen of VISA for 40 leading Belorussian personalities and the Aufeislegen of certain fortunes, could be lifted if these elections were assessed by the observers when clean. 
According to the opposition they weren't it. 
Heterogeneous association of twelve parties 'we were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the counting', one Juri Potemkin, press agent of the union of democratic strengths, was sorry. 
Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the presidential election in 2006 and leader of the pro-Europe movement, emphasizes this is a cosmetic change because it is of importance, who counts the voices and is this the executive with us. 
If representatives of the opposition move into the parliament then because they were appointed and not voted. 
But her move to the parliament can mean broadcasting time on the television, meeting in the regions and law suggestions. ' 
So the opposition owes itself to interfere in the political game because the dialog with the European Union must ' be opened. 
Our economy which is responsible opposite Russia strongly gets into a crisis and we don't reform each other, we run the risk of becoming a patronage of Russia because if. 
Well, we claim to be independent '. 
The opposition fears that the organization for safety and cooperation in Europe which has pursued the choice course doesn't respect the choice as valid. 
She emphasizes that the poll numbers seem too high and that the expansion of the voting has in advance paved the way (for 26% of the voters of Minsk) for any kind of manipulation. 
'Year has noticed you, that a choice has taken place?, the leader of the social democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the two last political prisoners, asks this one this in August you released. 
Nobody was in the polling stations. 
And it will be at most five representatives of the opposition in the parliament and although those, these correspond to the ideas of the government most likely. ' 
The silence of the night sinks over the October place again. 
President Lukachenko and the members of the central electoral commission congratulate themselves on their success on television.
