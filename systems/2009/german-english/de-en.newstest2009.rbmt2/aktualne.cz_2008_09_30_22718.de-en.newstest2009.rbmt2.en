Questions about the accident: Are stewards unlawful in the bus? 
It doesn't know the law, this isn't allowed to Umherlaufen in a far coach 
The question stands up in connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the society student Agency nearby the Italian Padua, whether stewards and travelers during the journey in the bus to and be allowed to herlaufen. 
"We wanted to observe the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward contradicts the law about the traffic so", so the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident a twenty-two-year-old stewardess was killed last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck, the this bus crossed the way. 
The young woman was sitting next to the driver on the least safe place in the car at this moment for all accident although she still had another two places at the disposal. 
However, a bus can have an accident or slow down sharply also at the moment at which the steward delivers coffee or newspapers. 
A role also plays, whether the bus after the registration document also is equipped with standing rooms. 
If this isn't provided by the bus, the travelers must sit. 
The far coaches of student Agency don't have any standing rooms; .cz confirmed what the director of the company, Radim Jan?ura, opposite Aktuáln?. 
"We have discussed this with the department and this hasn't agreed to the movement of travelers first. 
Later has one taken this back, and we have reached an agreement, after what may the travelers go during the journey on the toilet if they have their seat ", it informed about its point of view. 
The law doesn't know any steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward -- no legal provision describes this role. 
There isn't any legal provision either which forbids the carrier to render services, though. 
The law about the traffic knows only the concept vehicle companion; it, however, doesn't define the rights and duties the spokesman of the department adds Hanzelka obviously ". 
The director of the department street vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn ý, however, thinks that the law covers these difficulties afterwards. 
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing rooms in the product admittance. 
All this then is ", he emphasizes. 
Busses subdivide themselves into town busses where there are standing rooms and the maximum speed is limited, short-distance traffic busses, with standing rooms and permissible a higher speed and far coaches without standing rooms with the highest permitted speed and seats which are equipped with seat belts. 
Like in the airplane says the expert 
Ín doesn't see any basic problem in the movement of stewards the BESIP expert for roadworthiness Jaroslav Ho?on board of a bus. 
"At a liquid way of driving many dangers don't threaten the situation is comparable with the service on board of an airplane. 
Himself isn't sure when turbulences come and the stewardess can also here push the head." 
"If a bus brakes, however, sharply, then the laws are for physics of course, too. 
Just like in the town bus or in a streetcar. 
The carrier must clear the safety of the stewards ", he says and thinks by internal regulations also that these difficulties aren't solved completely from the view of the law. 
Ura is ready to paint the services Jan? 
Student Agency offers services of stewards as the only bus company. 
The company employs about two hundred persons in this function. 
The director doesn't consider her profession risk prone after the accident either. 
"I but the impression gets that the profession of the steward is risk prone as soon as I will paint it. 
Coffee and newspapers can get the travelers at boarding. 
This also would lower the costs ", he thinks. 
As interest in the safety the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin gives reasons for being absent of stewards in his busses. However, his society operates only a fraction of lines in the comparison with student Agency. 
"We don't have any stewardesses, we already fight against it from the beginning. 
This ends with any fatal accident ", sooner or later it intended not quite one spoken year for T ý den.cz. 
This was an unbelievable tragedy 
At the accident of a regular bus to Naples a young stewardess had had an accident from the region Pilsen which had worked for the society for two years. 
The Slovenian truck was probably bent by the stand stripe without flashing and had blocked the bus the journey. 
The driver of the bus tried to make way by a sharp maneuver collided, however, with the right front with the truck. 
Jan denies that the two places have been sold for the stewards?ura. 
"These places cannot be reserved at long-distance connections, they are blocked." 
Company wants to sue truck drivers. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman the agency won't wait for the judgement, it, however, expects a financial compensation also on the part of the guilty person. 
An amendment of the law? 
Not in view 
A more exact regulation of the movement of stewards on board of a bus could bring about a legal regulation a thirty-headed expert team of the Ministry of Transport works on already over a year. 
"This hasn't reached any concrete end yet, though. 
Busses don't stand the agenda, rather the Punktesystem, the maximum speed on the freeway and the use of mobile telephones in case of the journey ín absolutely on ", so expert Ho?either. 
The Ministry of Transport "doesn't" regard the activity of the stewards as something which could endanger the safety of the travelers fundamentally how control of the safety of the busses is, so Hanzelka, in the competence of the police and the maintenance of industrial health and safety standards authorities.
