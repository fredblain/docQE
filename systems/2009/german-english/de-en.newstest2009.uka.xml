<seg id="1"> Duel on a knife's edge: MP3 players on mobile phones. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> We advise you in your election </seg>
<seg id="3"> While almost every mobile phone MP3-Dateien can take place, there can be no more phones MP3 player. </seg>
<seg id="4"> So it is, of course, that it is better to buy only a telephone. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Even so, there are plenty of reasons why you should be a stand-alone player. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The election all depends on the kind of use and the ambitions the future owner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Sure it is buying hard for home a splendid expensive record player to listen to the latest album from Maxim Turbulenc. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Once such musical new seem not LPs and qualitative perspective, there is no objective reason for this. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But you have LPs with kind of rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, dream you probably at least one of them. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So it is with the music on trips, with komprimierter music, simplified - music in MP3-Format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Here, too, there is price and quality categories. </seg>
<seg id="12"> On the one hand, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player to spend eight thousand kroner, but it will be a hard Pink-Floyd-Fan headphones for 20 kronor from the market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Two extremes between where there is for any room. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The selection is diverse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Also the lifespan of the batteries is crucial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some good Music player can take place a lot more than just music, but the mobile phones they create not even hints. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern equipment is so universally, such as the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the Simsen, there can be music and videos, both of which, it has a better, a worse photo apparatus and perhaps can also navigate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And if the Smartphons and includes Kommunikatoren has almost a small computer in the bag. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a minor miracle, because no refrigerator grillen and no television. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the universality of mobile phones also disadvantages. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The more functions you use on your cell phone, the more often, however, you will need to nachladen. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the music is one of the largest energy omnivores. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Only a few mobile phones music can longer than ten played 12 hours, mostly it is much less. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this respect, Music player (especially the simplest) much more efficient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> So you should expect in the cheap mobile phones so that they can no longer than a few hours of music. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you then and still make a telephone call you buy prefer to safety a loading gear for the office, this also applies to more expensive equipment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> You MP3-Playern will not have this problem, the less good hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with a time Aufladen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Another problem is, if you want to papered over the music on mobile phones. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately, has only a small part of the equipment on a USB-Abschluss, moreover, not every mobile phone directly without special software on a PC. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Of course, you can directly the music to a storage medium papered over, but only a few cards read equipment without reduction with the tiny memory cards, which are used in mobile phones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> You Playern need to exceptions (iPod) no specific software. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They need the machine only about USB-Port with music from your PC to feed. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Most mobile phones and player even a music library, disorderly after the name of the performers, the title of the Albums, the Genre or, for example, the assessment by users. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some devices are only the tree structure of the catalogues, register Explorer, some, like the Windows can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon smart phones with operating system). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Players are easier to use mobile phones more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In the selection of a specific piece of equipment you should particularly after the lifespan of the Akkus, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of Klangs and, of course, the Bedien inquire of comfort. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For music, above all, time and you hear it every day, only briefly, for example, in the trams, then any mobile phone, the MP3-Dateien. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What really almost every mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They must also not very control what a mobile phone music formats can process or a player. </seg>
<seg id="41"> MP3, all, and most of the music that you get in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format is one of the most popular, and also the most equipment also music played in the WMA-Format. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Less is customary AAC (a format that use Apple and its iPods). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Better mobile phones also allow the purchase of online music. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One need only on mobile Internet the side of a Providers (or any other provider to call), and you can buy a song or album. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This service may be in for a sufficiently convincing argument for why one should a music phone. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately, the offer of bad providers and limited mostly only on quick radio Hits. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Prices are not the lowest. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In general, however, is that it is precisely this kind of sale of music (whether it be through GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in future will dominate the music industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> The mobile phone, the majority. </seg>
<seg id="51"> If you have the inclination to listen to something you forgotten after the mobile phone in the detection equipment, while the players at home. </seg>
<seg id="52"> There is, however, whether you always headphones, or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung in. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker on almost every mobile phone, but only the least MP3 player. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The biggest benefit of the music, mobile phones will be for many in the price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The cheapest typically cost less than three thousand kroner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> For three and four thousand kroner get you a very decent Walkman. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The biggest handicap will be for the majority that are not normal headphones. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The best and technically ausgereiftesten telephones with a 3,5-mm-Öffnung for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand kroner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The advantage of the player, in turn, lies in the slight servicing. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use. </seg>
<seg id="61"> A minimum of functions, the similarity in the servicing with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or, for example, the record player is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="62"> There is no collision in the form of a mistaken salaried mobile Internet and then exorbitant bill for data transfers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> What equipment should now </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> Also the cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for austauschbare storage media (type M2, microSD u.ä.). </seg>
<seg id="65"> Even if you are a karte nachkaufen, two thousand kroner. </seg>
<seg id="66"> But respect. </seg>
<seg id="67"> The basic models are usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the most expensive can also 8-GB-Speicherkarten read. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then you use after Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. </seg>
<seg id="70"> According to capacity (max. 2 GB) must then you no more than 1100 kronor on the table. </seg>
<seg id="71"> You are one of the more ambitious Group's room, you prefer to specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, a number of Nokia and Samsung). </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first virtual providers are already this year, the Czech Republic. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Perhaps </seg>
<seg id="3"> The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite sophisticated, the Czech providers offer virtually all of the services, as they are from their partners in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual providers, forcing the traditional at lower prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Perhaps this will not be long in coming. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> That the Czech mobile phone operators to the most expensive work in Europe, we have often Mobil.cz reported. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This, incidentally, also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which brought to our attention that the price for a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation roaming charges it is probably a paradoxical situation - for some customers, the Czech mobile providers SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> How is it that the prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe, are so high? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is simple, there is no competition, which really is a challenge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Perhaps it sounds paradoxical in the Czech Republic, there are three mobile networks and a Penetration by far more than 100 %. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The mobile phone providers against grumble about the fact that it is very much at the Czech market competition. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The often also approves of the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, often in the past, that there is no place in the Czech Republic for a further providers. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is likely that a classic providers with its own network no longer has very many opportunities (incidentally, he would probably be hard to find even frequencies). </seg>
<seg id="15"> But there is still a way - a virtual providers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The entry of virtual providers in the mobile phone market brought a sharp price reduction, in which the traditional mobile phone operators had to respond. </seg>
<seg id="17"> There were even before the entry of such companies such as Tesco, Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in the United Kingdom similar votes as in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But it has shown that there is for such providers place and that they can really be successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Incidentally, it does not take long to find examples. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In February of this we have reported on the start of the virtual provider mobile King in Poland. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In just half a year this providers to win more than 100 thousand customers and so for the five largest providers of the country. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Behind mobile King is the financial group penta, which is in the Czech Republic, among other things, U: fon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The advantage of virtual providers is that you can on a much more specific target group. </seg>
<seg id="24"> To be able to function effectively virtual providers need much less customers than a classic providers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They do not need a relatively high costs for construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the world make the virtual providers usually the Low-Cost firms - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which will, however, often from a less extensive range of services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> So, for example, provides Tesco Mobile in the United Kingdom SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. </seg>
<seg id="28"> However, as the example of mobile shows King in Poland, it can also be quite a good move to bet on a cliché best target group. </seg>
<seg id="29"> These providers is: specifically to men. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Real vote Kerle mobile King - the vendor they like and they can trust," David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile entertainment Company, the company this virtual provider. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It's hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland in the Czech Republic take root. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Doubts also press spokesman of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: " the Czech market is relatively small for a segment of the market, at the most virtual providers are based. </seg>
<seg id="33"> He is also from the point of view of the relatively services saturated. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In the Czech Republic chancenlos, my mobile phone providers </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile providers conquered the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile King. </seg>
<seg id="36"> " While we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but to see in the Czech Republic, the negotiations not very hopeful. </seg>
<seg id="37"> There is more to a market of mobile King in other countries, our region, " says in a telephone conversation on Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press spokesperson for the penta financial group. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Indirectly, they confirmed that the existing mobile phone providers this idea in the Czech Republic are not very sympathetic. </seg>
<seg id="39"> On the contrary, they are trying to do everything we can to ensure that no potential competitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Their interest in a launch of a virtual mobile provider shows for some time the GTS Novera group that wants to take another step to be a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area firms customers. </seg>
<seg id="41"> " We have an interest in going to offer our customers not only fixed - but also mobile telecommunications services. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And the sooner, the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> About that possibility we have repeatedly negotiated with all Czech mobile phone providers. </seg>
<seg id="44"> With some of them, we were able to make progress in negotiations, " the press spokesman Pavel Kaidl group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Perhaps now better times. </seg>
<seg id="46"> No official information reveals that the first virtual providers is perhaps by the end of the year to come. </seg>
<seg id="47"> So far, but this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. </seg>
<seg id="48"> " At this moment we are not in the Czech Republic, there is room for a full virtual providers. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market compared to other major markets specifics. </seg>
<seg id="50"> So far, has not yet entity, with a complex and raised serious project in this area, " says in his Mobil.cz Vlastimil explanation for Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> The nature of the Czech market other providers. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The press T-Mobile spokesperson of Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement of O2 added: "so far we have not yet viable and on both sides favourable project found that it could continue to build". </seg>
<seg id="53"> And it adds: " in the network of T-Mobile will appear by the end of the year, hardly a virtual providers. </seg>
<seg id="54"> At this moment, we would already have a concrete offer, so that we can in the short term thinking. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone is its attention more to meet the demands of their own 3G-Lizenz. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav Čepický says: " for negotiations with potential virtual providers we are open, particularly in the field division of the costs and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> We see this from the perspective of the customer the best. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a quick mobile Internet. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The competent authorities, with the providers hand in hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The actions of the mobile phone operators is easy to understand, another providers would be more competition, this would lead to falling prices and a decline in profits. </seg>
<seg id="61"> So why should such a competitors entering the market? </seg>
<seg id="62"> That the providers can draw on the same side when it comes to anything, also the long to-ing and fro-ing to the emergence of U: fon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Probably the most powerful push in the direction of ČTÚ was at the time, when U: fon came on the market by society T-Mobile. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The show also publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ-Webseiten. </seg>
<seg id="65"> But now it is just U: fon as an argument for why we should not allow a virtual providers. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Martina Kemrová said: " the competitive environment of the mobile phone market has been strengthened recently, also by entering the market a fourth mobile provider. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Taking into account the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player in the market itself and, above all, his services high standards ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Given this approach, the mobile phone operators, however, surprised the absolute lack of Czech regulatory authorities. </seg>
<seg id="69"> It is not just about the attitude of the ČTÚ in Czech unfortunately - in contrast to Britain and other advanced countries - does not have the authority to intervene in the economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="70"> This alone has the power to protect the economic competition (ÚOHS). </seg>
<seg id="71"> This but referred to his this whole issue very typical stance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> " The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after it has come to a conclusion of the contract between a mobile providers and a virtual providers about the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="73"> To date, there has been no such contract, because the supply of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional providers, " in his response to our request Kristián Chalupa by the Department of ÚOHS foreign relations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> Representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a phrase. </seg>
<seg id="75"> From a authority, which represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one misused his position in the market, this is more a matter of concern. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: "abroad, where virtual providers is quite normal work to see that its market entry to a price reduction has contributed to mobile phone services." </seg>
<seg id="77"> But probably belong to the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and not a price cut to the interests of the ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> It is truly shocking in this case the almost touching line of the three mobile phone operators from their response. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question of whether or not it is really just a coincidence, is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Just as the same gasoline prices at the petrol station, to make sure only by chance and the result is a hard competition. </seg>
<seg id="81"> " The authority has discovered no evidence in this case, which suggest that the against the competition act, and thus she has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter. </seg>
<seg id="82"> None of the providers has a dominant market position, so he has not increased responsibility for his actions in the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The necessary tools for an opening of the mobile phone market for virtual lack suppliers also likely of the regulatory authority for telecommunications, " Chalupa led in his statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The interpretation of a dominant position in the market is one of many controversial areas. </seg>
<seg id="85"> There are, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTÚ, after the telecommunications, from the point of view of the economic competition is a single market. </seg>
<seg id="86"> In such a market has, of course, none of the Czech mobile providers a dominant position. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Some legal experts but offer a different point of view - for entering the market of virtual provider is always needed the approval of the network operator. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And the mobile phone providers - logically - for its network a monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="89"> It means that in a certain segment is necessarily a dominant position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Even if but not with this reasoning refuses, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three mobile phone operators remarkably similar. </seg>
<seg id="91"> They show complaints a number of interested parties (including the society GTS Novera) that in negotiations with all the providers in very similar obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Buck-passing is on the ČTÚ in the telecommunication services a fairly usually trick the ÚOHS distanced itself from the whole affair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> This was in a number of similar cases. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately, it is not managed, in the recently passed amendment of the telecommunications law, the enlargement of the powers of the ČTÚ to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts from an improvement in the situation had promised. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The representatives of the ÚOHS know only too well, but they probably have other interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It is, when no one look </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> Overlooked remains once the functioning of any pseudo virtual providers, of which there are in the Czech mobile networks several. </seg>
<seg id="98"> There are companies that own price lists for mobile telecommunications services are only partly public. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Usually it is firms operating in the area Multilevel-Marketing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Its own offer mobile phone services, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Star Life and others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The price lists of these firms normally only to select. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The joke of the matter is that the firm against the operators than classical firms customer, a large amount of SIM cards. </seg>
<seg id="103"> As an important customer receives it special price offers (and other offers). </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile providers a similar ban resale. </seg>
<seg id="105"> "There should be cases you describe, then it can be a violation of the act contractual conditions, with which we are dealing, which could lead to a cessation of cooperation with the society," said Martina Kemrová on our question on this problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> But it is unlikely that such a thing with the leaders of the mobile phone operators is not around. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Particularly in the case of the three firms mentioned it can act of thousands of customers. </seg>
<seg id="108"> No operator resisted, however, that such an approach. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Flowing from the activity of these firms them not inconsiderable profits, they are at the same time - in contrast to the actual virtual suppliers - will not be affected by the real official marketing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> On makes possible problems Miroslav Čepický attention: " the law allows these types of speculation, in spite of everything, used the services of these firms have only a very small percentage of customers. </seg>
<seg id="111"> They also have to accept that the SIM-Karte in her phone is not on their behalf, so they can't fully about as ordinary customers mobile providers. " </seg>
<seg id="112"> Alone, but they ought to at least the ČTÚ strange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> Also opened up a further question for the ÚOHS. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Close the mobile providers before such an approach the eyes why they block a virtual providers? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It is to add to that the ÚOHS detecting such activities has very strong powers, and if it does not want to ban, it must not be the statement of the providers, they know nothing of them and their business conditions would be satisfied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> When the Czech Republic is no longer on the most expensive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> As the text has already been a number of occasions, the market virtual providers a sharp decline in price in the various services. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Have virtually in all countries, where virtual providers are the traditional providers to try to prevent the emergence of virtually more or less. </seg>
<seg id="119"> They used arguments were virtually identical - a too small, or too much gesättigter market, problems with the quality of services, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> In advanced countries but picked up the regulatory agencies in these moments, which is by no means the interests of the mobile phone operators, but tried to maintain their customers. </seg>
<seg id="121"> It was followed by formal or informal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operators, and this further. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately, the Czech throw the whole case, regulatory bodies like a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Based on our experience we cannot get rid of that lack of clarity in the competence in these cases, is more than good. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> But we do not throw in the towel. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If the Czech mobile market background information and soon a virtual providers, will soon, perhaps moving again. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If a supply the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, this will not stand idly by ÚOHS when it comes to discriminate against other interested parties to reject (). </seg>
<seg id="127"> And the Czechs are finally no more phones more expensive than the rest of Europe. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The lack of big words in the letter to the board of WestLB not to the staff of the House. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Through a combination of units of the Düsseldorfer money Institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank could emerge, " the central capital market House of " l financial group, " it says in the letter on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The WestLB would provide a "competence bloc" with sustainable profitability in such a deal. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And could be such a link the key impetus to further Bündelungen in the country's banking sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It reads like a Board at a difficult time wants to demonstrate ability to act. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Because the wounded WestLB remains under massive pressure. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for financial services regulation of North Rhine Westphalia country's government has only recently made clear to urge the time to find a sustainable solution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Of a sort of link between the Deka-Bank, " l know customers because of their investments fund and the WestLB is, however, for some time speech to Frankfurt. </seg>
<seg id="10"> He has Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas during the presentation of the six-month figures at the end of August to know in a merger of the House in the Mainzer country road with a country Bank, for example, the Helaba or, see no sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But the Board of the Deka, half of the country's banks and savings banks associations, instructed the board to lead with the WestLB talks on common business activities. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It could go to the capital markets business or parts of it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The talks have said in the financial, only just begun. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> By the Deka-Bank matters with their 3000 staff, the more important employers on financial centre Frankfurt, is not the first time, when it comes to consolidation in the " l sector. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2003 it looked for a moment as the Deka-Bank with the country's bank Rhénanie-Palatinat merge and Helaba. </seg>
<seg id="16"> From this tripartite Confederation, however, was nothing. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The plans were publicly the Hessische national government against a participation of Helaba in. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The two other houses next, not each other. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The country's bank Rhénanie-Palatinat was, instead, to the country Baden-Würtemberg Bank in Stuttgart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But it has repeatedly thought games on a link to the Deka-Bank with the country's banks. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Recently, however, had Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba against plan games on a with his house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Regardless of but seems to mature the realization that a focus of the various houses of the public sector. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Now, after the Land election in Bavaria is over, could begin a link the BayernLB with the Baden-Württemberg Bank closer. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For the Helaba is not necessarily good news. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Should increase the pressure on other mergers, go to her and the partners. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the south, it would be flowing junior partner, even though they were the financial crisis so far, far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A go with the West LB, in turn, has the cash savings and current Association Hesse Thuringia, with 85 percent involved in Helaba is the beginning of the year. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If the North LB. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Such geo-strategic considerations but are only one side. </seg>
<seg id="30"> On the other there is the question of how different business models of individual houses suited to each other. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In June, said Merl, the crucial question with which business model the future ability of the country's banks should be secured by the German savings banks - and current Association has not been answered. </seg>

<seg id="13"> I am not the type who likes to speak before people, a class of 40 pupils. </seg>

<seg id="15"> I lift, I have so the desk and try right: ' Sayonara where she Sylvana... ' - hot Sylvana, come from Germany, and in a week of birthday. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> A rat or a fleeing Schabe in danger this means that it also feels fear? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: much animals have feelings. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Just how to check whether they feel the same if it is similar to how we behave? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Internet magazine Edge " will be published for several years, contributions famous scientists. </seg>
<seg id="6"> SPIEGEL ONLINE presented in a series of selected answers to the question, "what do you think, without being able to demonstrate"? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> I believe that animals sentiments and others have awareness conditions without that I or anyone else could prove it so far, where we can't even prove that other human consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In this case, but we must hope, at least, because all human brains are the same basic configuration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But once we turn to other species, and questions of sense or, more generally, raise awareness, we are entering impassable terrain, because the hardware is not true. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> If a rat is at risk, it is doing the same thing as many other animals: she is dead, retreats or attacks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> People behave similarly, suggesting some scientists to conclude a comparable subjective experience. </seg>
<seg id="12"> I do not believe, however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Two aspects of the brain structure make it hard to give our subjective experience on the animals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For one thing, the almost always on human consciousness associated circuits the roadside prefrontal cortex (because of his participation in the short-term memory and the implementation / control functions). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This broad region is in humans evolved much higher than in the rest of the primates and seems entirely on other creatures. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At least for those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge to choose who we are, and the ability to plan and so there is reason to believe that the man even different from the other primates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Another dramatic nature may lie in the linguistic human nature: because so much of its Erlebens is associated with language, it is often the awareness links. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this case, it could exclude animals. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But even if consciousness not by language, then this would certainly influence so that animal awareness, as it may be, probably the most of our awareness of Being unterschiede conditions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> That is why it is difficult to determine how awareness may look for other animals. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If it is something Internes and Subjektives, either measure because of the specific hardware analyze from our own experience, his research presents us with major problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Most of my speeches are related to the content of the deliberate Erlebens, but there is also another aspect of the awareness, scientific and be more easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> You could examine the awareness processes of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what is happening in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the case of visualize. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick carrying more moved on the neural Korrelate of consciousness than the causal mechanism: both may be identical or not. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex to reach the visualize. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> What follows now for the sentiments? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I put them back on an emotive system as the fear in one of his own conscious brain activity is activated. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What we call a "fear", so is the mental state of affairs in which we find ourselves if the activity in the brain lokalisierten defence system (or whose consequences, such as physical reactions) working memory. </seg>
<seg id="29"> So the sentiments are intimately linked to the regions of the cortex, the primates, and especially the people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Coupled with the linguistic nature are fine graduations of it, because we can with the help of the words and grammar conditions and differentiate categorise them alongside ourselves also attributable to others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> By contrast, for example, says Antonio Damasio that sentiments from low-level activities in the Körpergefühlsregionen of the cortex and the brain tribal emerge similar Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain stem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> As this network in the course of human evolution have not changed much, it could well be involved in semi-generic overarching sentiments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Purely in theory, I could not disagree with me, but I think it is unbeweisbar. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Pankseep argues, which appear in rats and people like fear, probably in two cases: but, as you can check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave in the same way? </seg>
<seg id="35"> A fleeing Schabe in danger if they, too, feels fear? </seg>
<seg id="36"> In my view, can prove just behavior similarity not yet Erlebens equality. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The neurale helps comparison: rats and humans have similar brain tribes, Schaben, by contrast, is not even a brain. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But the brain stem is responsible for feelings? </seg>
<seg id="39"> And even if you could show for people: how to prove in rats? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), have feelings. </seg>
<seg id="41"> But I do not know how I should prove it. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And because their sentiments probably fundamentally from our different (since the human consciousness on specific levers circles, and is based on language), I would rather erforsche the emotional behavior than the emotional sentiments of rats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> In any case, this is progress on the neural level, to the extent that in rats and people of the same. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As I erforsche language and awareness in rats, not sentiments, but I do not know whether they exist. </seg>
<seg id="45"> You may think this is short-sighted to run, but I would rather than constantly against a wall. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Lance T. Izumi, senior scientific staff in Kalifonischen studies and a senior director in the specialist education Sciences of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book, "not as good as you think: why the middle class needs a school choice." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To address the Hispanic voters is a complex task. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Barrack Obama's proposals on the subject of education are a case in point. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Obama's campaign said a successful conclusion, "the likely afro-amerikanischen and Hispanic students, the school is lower than in white pupils" - what is true. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In order to close this performance, recommends that Obama's education plan specifically among other bilingual transition in training for those who learn English. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Still, there is the question to Obama, whether its use for the bilingual education places the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest to reduce the gap in the education services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Let us take the example of "Sixth Street Prep," a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The majority of the students are hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> More than a third of the students, many of which are only recently in the country to learn English. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Yet in 2008, stunning 100 per cent pupils the fourth class the state math exam in insisting on a good level. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Also surprising 93 per cent of children from the fourth school year in the English test as well. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This astonishing success has been achieved with other methods than those who favors Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Sixth Street school places its focus to review and exercise, on the slow, steady control knowledge and an attitude which tolerates no exceptions. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Furthermore, the school, the approach after training in an English-speaking environment. This is exactly the point that Obama is to be noted, the school head Linda Mikels. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This approach attaches to the almost ausschlies southern use of the English language in the specialist teaching. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mrs Mikels, rejects the idea of bilingual education, said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a student, was on the verge of from Mexico. 12 months later would enter the class space and it can no longer see again. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "It works," she said, "it works for us." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Obama would be a school as the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other students learning English? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The performance of the school that would easily make the answer to that question, but the educational positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support has long been the idea of bilingual education), and his own unstinting support for the bilingual education to make predictions about Obama's uncertain reply. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> While he agrees to the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently the subject of trivialised by noted that people should stop worry about on "only English" document legislation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Instead, he said: "they should make sure that your child Spanish". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> When Obama, in fact, the performance gap wants to close, they should carefully consider education models to trivialise the work, rather than to despise. </seg>

<seg id="35"> "I do not think that they understood their contribution in the world, or their legacy in the slightest," can fit in Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston which was published in 2003. </seg>

<seg id="36"> The turning point came in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the city to replace the Kennedy tabloid, the slow two-way main street of the community. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Orlandos suburbs have already had the motorway through 4 of the Western city sidelines. </seg>

<seg id="45"> In 1955, behind asked Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, the demand of the Supreme Court to force integration by its decision in the case of Brown against the Schulrat as "offensive respektierend instead of my race." </seg>
<seg id="46"> Residents now say that although the lifting of racial segregation was positively in some respects, they weakened the groups cohesion in Eaton Ville and be aware of its young people. </seg>

<seg id="47"> "Black children were used to being umarmt - and I remember this - we embraced his teachers in the morning, and one of his teachers embraced in the evening," N.Y.

<p>
<seg id="69"> Many in Eaton, as Mrs Jones, a bold, assertive teacher with a preference for Dunkelrot still fear that their secretive community misunderstood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> And yet, at the same time, the greater the Hurston-Festival was born, was also a greater degree of home proud. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Young people in particular tend to see Eaton Ville as Hurston saw their whole race: beautiful, with all its problems, either worse or better and equally proud, creative, and hardworking, ridiculous and mixed as any other race - and international group in America. </seg>

<seg id="10"> Ordinary people are on the portraits of artists, who are in the situation on the stage passion, sadness, happiness and to the audience. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The personality of the artists to keep, you must not make photographs at the scene. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Their personality and character is in their hearts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere, which would allow me to stick with the photo camera the characters, the largest Flamenco masters '. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Bauer, inspired by the festival, " Cante de Minas read ', in 1997, on a long journey to singer to photograph Gitaristen or dancer with a digital camera. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Thanks to the Bildsortierungsfunktion the camera and the existing material created pictures recall classic photograph. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The use of different stylistic destroyed means the traditional basis of the picture, the image of modernity and the idea of how the farmer Flamenco understands: " music with traditional roots, changed and surprised every day '. </seg>
<seg id="17"> These are not only the dance, song, or Instrumental game in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, the audience with his art. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The search for the essence, after a certain thing, which is presented in the form of the Hörens, of being visible is and was a firm target this work, which in the coming period in the gallery of the El Fotómata. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Well-known figures in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente crony and others belong to the close selection of almost 70 artists, were photographed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The project has been a Anthologie of Flamencos, and will soon as book, with all the portraits from the exhibition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Bauer's passion to the portraits led him to take this idea two years ago, again and as "portraits of veterans of the sport to achieve ' (" SportART Project '). </seg>
<seg id="22"> Although the concepts of the project "Flamenco people ' are different, the photograph to Count" it gives me great pleasure to photograph the people they know to learn and to enable state whose life, be it for a brief moment or a longer time. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I think that in the area of the photograph is the portrait, the most difficult breed. </seg>
<seg id="24"> You triffst or on individuals, individuals you sometimes not at all will be familiar with, or they leave you alone for a couple of minutes to make a photograph. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to achieve my ideas. </seg>

<seg id="3"> In this way, the Cineast has tried to portray " a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he had always been in the works of the famous novel writer admired, said today Carci in the presentation of the Filmes with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers. </seg>

<seg id="13"> For all he embodied a platonisches ideal of beauty and truth. </seg>

<seg id="7"> But, from the outset, we all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The nonsense begins with the ticket to get to you allowed to go, as the first. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It seems to me, too, should not be a bad thing, but if you do, then they give you everything (including chip, in order to avoid the congestion on the road). </seg>
<seg id="10"> Not yet. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They let you only get the ticket (the first nonsense, which is the only reason to go) and (after a never-ending waiting lists) because the surprise is, the T-Shirt, there were only in the size of the "s" (a second nonsense because I need the size XL) </seg>
<seg id="12"> Where we live? </seg>
<seg id="13"> Or is it the case that was decided after the crisis only small, much cheaper to buy shirts from less stuff? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Well, things like this are a small beer compared with the days on the street. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Apart from the fact that you have very early to go to the chip, there is already a waiting lists of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you must let schoolbag. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The wait has taken more than 35 minutes, which are expected in the case of a street, where 11 36000 people, is incomprehensible. </seg>
<seg id="17"> After all, as it was to be expected, began the streets and we have had our back bags not leave, even if it was once managed to recover, but they would be more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It also saw in those waiting 40 minutes by rain, so it was tempting to organize a popular uprising and attacked the excited. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I think this morning, to be sure, some 500 people have pneumonia and some as I can, because this chip, which I received, not even in time the classification, I think that the outcome was wrong. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Of course, if you ask me, after a perfect street would this road would never improve. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So I think we are still a long dream of a city, which is well prepared for the Olympic Games </seg>

<seg id="13"> Steve Ballmer noted that if the computer would be equipped with the Notwendigsten, rather than to fill it with the commercial waste, so they would work five times faster. Man, Steven will be just for the few. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Everything is just an observation, given that Microsoft Windows versions a function or other and causing " extras '. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The shift is worth </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Microsoft is right, the operating system is beginning to lose, just as the software. </seg>
<seg id="17"> As Google chromium in seemed to network, that was a part of the theory that it was the first step of Google in order to compete with Windows. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Sent many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be needed to ensure that hardware and software can work at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The operating system meets the role with the role his wife or his husband can be compared to tell when it comes to his mother-in-law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> That is true. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The system will never disappear, but we must of his "death", not as an absolute, but as a relative truth, thinking. </seg>
<seg id="23"> What Ballmer said this week, is the affirmation of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="24"> People pay less attention every time the operating system, the Web-Browser. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The computer will only launched the Firefox to execute the Explorer or chromium and every day, we spend more time on surfing in the vicinity of the ' window '. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What serves half of existing computer applications? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Less is more </seg>
<seg id="28"> And Windows 7 must be compact, much more compact than vista. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The interest from Microsoft's more is to integrate its online services, which are then, after all, the alternative to Google. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In reality they need without doubt. I am a small example of this. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The photograph of this place, I have made in Redmond, in one of the recreational spaces for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. </seg>
<seg id="33"> On the soft drinks machine is a sign that says: " your. Our future '. It will print a request to use their own tool for online search. </seg>
<seg id="34"> In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that the 66 % of employees at Microsoft, Google for the research used on the network. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Incidentally, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 of the delay. </seg>
<seg id="36"> It is not early, but the end of 2009, rather even 2010. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Microsoft is seeking the possibility of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time on the market. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Every day the phone turned into a computer. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The Android, and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Meeting - from blood that was surely </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hema Quebec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding and its President, Dr. Francine Décary had every reason to rejoice, because Hema Quebec has become one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And, above all, it has won the confidence of the public, which has been shaken by the scandal from the contaminated blood in the 1980's and 1990's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As you know, the national blood from the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross managed reserves during the 1980's with HIV and hepatitis C-Virus contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Given this tragedy, and the public discontent, the Canadian Government in February 1994 a public, the judge Horace Krever led investigation, which was intended to shed light on the circumstances, which had led to such a tragedy, and draw up guidelines to prevent another disaster of this nature. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While judges hesitate Krever, his report to make, then several provinces a Committee on its feet, whose goal it was to develop a new system for managing blood in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In Quebec met the committee Gélineau this mandate. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever were founded in Canada two blood banks: Hema Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, in order to provide the other provinces and the two territories. </seg>
<seg id="9"> " In 1998, when Hema Quebec is at work, little 38 % of the people had faith in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood and the work in this area over the following years, we have won the confidence of the public, she says, before they proudly emphasized that the beginning of 2008 now almost 94 % of the population of Quebec confidence in Hema Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Dr. Décary but retains knowing that " trust is something extremely fragile. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since its inception, is on 28 September 1998 Hema Quebec following the principle of caution. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At the time, we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new kind of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the woman told the since its inception in 1998, holding the leadership. </seg>
<seg id="15"> " And we had not the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So we invoked one of the main directives reports from Krever, and Gélineau that applies to the exclusion of action if you do not know, and if a disease only slowly continues, as it appears in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a degeneration of the brain, which will inevitably lead to death. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So, in April 1999, no blood of people who had since 1980 longer than a month in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Now, a few years ago, was shown without any doubt that the disease of the blood. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So has shown us this event that the principle of caution, which we would apply, has a sense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In 1999, appeared on the market, a much more precise technology to detect HIV: the Nukleinsäure-Tests (NST), which allow directly in the blood of the donor to prove that the presence of the virus itself, and not the antibodies against the virus, as it did in the past used tests the case. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The NST, enabled to shorten the incubation period, between the time the infected person and, if the first viruses through our techniques can be found in the blood, the specialist. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This time could be reduced to a period of less than a week. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It was the risk that some could be infected donors, without knowing it, and one that may not recognize much reduced. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These improvements have allowed it to cut the risk of AIDS on a blood transfusion to transfer to a large extent. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Today, is one of 12 million people in danger, blood contaminated with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="26"> " In other words, that means that 12 million would distribute blood, before someone infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Because Hema Quebec each year between 400,000 distributed and 500,000 blood, it would take more than 24 years before occurs in the case of HIV was transferred on a blood Konserve. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I believe that you can now feel comfortable if you get a blood transfusion or prescribed to restore health ', says the Direktions head of Hema Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="29"> " Our challenge for the next ten years, it is to preserve the safety of our products. </seg>
<seg id="30"> One never knows how germs can get into the system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Only last year has appeared on the island of Réunion the chikungunya virus, which is just as the Westnil-Virus by insects on the blood. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We must constantly monitor, Dr. Décary continues before they emphasized that Hema Quebec in addition to a safe supply must also a sufficient supply. </seg>
<seg id="33"> " The demand is rising, because the population is aging. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Because the treatments are aggressive cancer patients need often new red blood cells, or Blutplättchen. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The ageing population also has an impact on the network of blood donors, to an average of only 3 % of people eligible to donate blood include Quebec. ' </seg>
<seg id="36"> Can anyone healthy man, who is 18 years or older, and meet the eligibility criteria, all 56 days, so six times in the year to give blood. </seg>
<seg id="37"> On average, 14 % of the people who make their blood not adopted, because they are, for example, AIDS or malaria, and who is in a country where malaria is endemic, will be excluded for one year by the donations. </seg>
<seg id="38"> " With these 3 % we create an inventory to preserve that meets the needs of the hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The lack of supplies are rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But we must renew the members of this donor network when they are older, and no more to give blood. </seg>
<seg id="41"> It is hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them, and to bring them to be regular donors. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Life today is so hectic that one rarely finds the time to spend an hour in the blood donations, Francine Décary regrets. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With an annual budget of $ 297 million Hema Quebec provides not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone transplant, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin almost exclusively used heavy fire violations. </seg>
<seg id="44"> These tissues are investigated, and frozen before they are stored in Hema Quebec between, the only public cord blood bank managed Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In the umbilical cord, previously was regarded as a biomedical waste, is on stem cells rich blood, which can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia. </seg>
<seg id="46"> " A few weeks ago, we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood test, and we plan more than a thousand per year. </seg>
<seg id="47"> " We should start at the beginning of next year, to make it available for transplantation, explains Dr. Décary on this programme of abnahme umbilical cord blood - described as a very popular. </seg>
<seg id="48"> " Many mothers are convinced no access to have ', because Hema Quebec lack the resources to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals of Quebec. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Free - The orwellsche speech by Barrick gold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In its spending on 17 September Le Devoir, published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Barrick gold mine gold. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Confirms this, and a orwellsche logic, that the largest gold production society in the world a libel case about six million against three authors, and a small instrument By publishing house, with the aim of a " transparent public debate to open '. </seg>
<seg id="4"> If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge on the truth, especially in the case of smear complaints, but about the law. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As expected, this fundamental difference has been completely glossed over by Mr Garver. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, to ruin dares to represent one of the its opposite opinion. </seg>
<seg id="7"> No matter how the process, the authors and the editor of the book Noir between Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money in order to prepare their defense, and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight to be paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The tactic is unequal battles in the rest of the often to ruining the defenders in order to force an amicable settlement, which makes the other side and also that discourages anyone who dares to look again at the issue. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If Barrick gold really wanted to a public debate, she would present their point of view of things before the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By contrast, what works in many of the countries in which Barrick gold, is a matter of debate in Canada, usually through the exchange of ideas, and not by Knüppelhiebe. </seg>
<seg id="11"> So it would have been if the gold mine revealed their books and files have been opened, and a real debate, by the newspapers, the media, publishing and the financing of independent audit teams have light on that question. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But Barrick gold seems to have confidence in public opinion and shut the petitions and letters of support for the Noir between authors of Canada with one hand movement. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Maybe Mr Garver explain how he could ask at the same time, a "public" debate, but the views of these public? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apparently this word in the world of vice president, only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians ; a very nice beengte view of the term. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy, even the detractors the right to speak. </seg>
<seg id="16"> What does not understand Barrick gold - or don't want to understand - is that the general public, the authors and publishers supported by Noir between Canada, this is mostly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The public is willing to listen and Barrick, to judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in a framework, which many as little publicity perceive complaint (in the course of the " public debate ' Barrick gold has just a requirement for the authors by Noir between Canada, in which it is asking them not to use this term more...). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, is the complaint of Barrick Gold a direct attack on the freedom to academic research, and the truth are essential to any democratic society. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It denies the right to quote credible sources, and to discuss facts and interpretations, which are the basis of the intellectual work. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If it is impossible in a country such as Canada, to explore issues and to discuss the rich companies not of this world, who else can this do then? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If Barrick gold really wanted to be a public and transparent debate, it could lead by follows the scientific standards, which have been used by the authors of Noir between Canada. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It has a right to respond. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The university environment to which we belong to resolve has long known debates and disagreements to control and conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that they, in contrast to what they claim is in no mood for a transparent debate. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is a loss for the university world, as it was for the public debate, and it is time that the governments to take measures the complaints this kind of unjustified. </seg>

<seg id="25"> The level of VAT was generally from the hotel to four Révfülöp Kft. issued to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért bills wrong, since the operation rather than only 25 set off 15 % VAT also exclusively by the staff, mechanised issued bills were counterfeit documents, however, hand in writing. </seg>

<seg id="28"> As in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sport camps Kunfehértó, whose beteuerten business leaders who never issued bills. </seg>
<seg id="29"> A "mistake" is undermining the counterfeiters in the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this society was at the time (2001) just eaten in dissolution, when the group Fiatal Városért Egyesület there - the mass manager was therefore not even issued bills. </seg>

<seg id="43"> In reality, however, none of these firms was active, which, according to Angeklagtem was due to the lack of contracts. </seg>

<seg id="47"> Kubatov even the firm Szi-Beri Bt. abused for the exhibition of fictional accounts - in this case, the bills have been settled the application from Biztos Pont. </seg>

<seg id="4"> Hepatitis is the collective term for unleashed by various viruses, infectious liver disease. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The symptoms are often similar to liver inflammation and yellow are often, but the pathogens are different, and the disease from one another. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Depending on the virus's spread hepatitis viruses on two different species: hepatitis A and E by the Verdauungstrakt (for example, through contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D the viruses through blood and other body liquids (such as sperm, Scheidensekret or spittle). </seg>
<seg id="7"> In any case, passengers will be a vaccine against the virus A and B recommended against the C virus, there is no vaccine. </seg>

<seg id="10"> Worldwide every year, about 1 million people in the caused by hepatitis B, far more serious illnesses such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten of infected patients in medication. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Most of those infected do not even know about their illness, because the pathogen destroyed liver cells are both subtle - in many cases, the first symptoms after 20-30 years. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Believers have less pain? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> How new research has shown that the religious belief as a kind of "analgesics also acts" that have made it easier to the death of Catholic martyrs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Scientists at Oxford University have studied an interesting experiment carried out: it was the extent to which the belief in God, feel the pain of the people affected, the British newspaper reported "Telegraph". </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the wake of the more bizarre investigation received the 12 believers and atheists electric shocks while they studied a painting of the mother of God. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the results showed the believers were able to eliminate the bulk of the pain. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Using a brain scan showed technology could even be shown that Catholics were able to activate the part of her brain, which is responsible for the pain regulation. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The study was the first in a research project as well as scientists also philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University to take part. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In an attempt has been the subjects of a funkelndes equipment linked to the left hand, which electric shocks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: a picture of the mother of God, painted of Sassoferrato, in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vincis "lady with the Hermelin." </seg>
<seg id="10"> The researchers had hoped that the sight of young wife Maria among believers, a kind of religious Trance would provoke while they identified Vincis picture, because it is hardly different from the other paintings and has been treated as reassuring. </seg>
<seg id="11"> People spent a half an hour in a MRI scanners, and received in this period, a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should either the religious or the other paintings. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Catholics reported they had at the sight of the mother of God "in security" felt as if they would be "surrounded by," and they would have felt "peace and quiet." </seg>
<seg id="13"> During the Betrachtens of religious Gemäldes they have over 12 % reported less pain than if they Leonardos work had in mind. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The psychologist Miguel Farias, also attempt took part, said it could also similar effects with other strong acting images in the atheists, you would have to find just the photograph. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> At its tenth birthday celebrations, Google is fair to say: it is in the pockets of the people to find just as their minds in the sky: they know where people have spent their holidays to what doctors they go and what they moved. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And still not be enough, according to Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the direction of skeptics who plagued by Orwellian nightmare visions, he can do: they would miss the very essence of the web 2 point 0. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main objective of Google it is even more personal data about users to collect, and so the original purpose of the firm to get closer to that "all the information in the world". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Schmidt said Google was after ten years of work changing world still only at the beginning of the information collection. </seg>
<seg id="7"> He asked for the status quo in five years, said Schmidt: wanted, Google would be able to answer questions such as, "what am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "what job fits really to me?", but software programs are not yet in a position to do so, because they do not know enough about the user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Not all Internet users are aware that their Internet research the search terms would be recorded, and the IP addresses was sought, and the visited pages. </seg>
<seg id="9"> For example, two years ago introduced "Personalized Search" allowing the visitors to its own search to store and later resort, so that the net and later, generated much more precise and is based on the same logic the so-called "Recommendations," with whom the system tailor-made recommends products and services because of the previous preferences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Ask the users, however, what happens in the event of a data abuse - "if you check what I am" - some are worried the Google-Datenmonopols. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In most cases, but it is rather represented by the firm, potential power terrifying, and less the sense of guilt or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rebellion against the power, that is for many Internet users. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But it is a proven fact that the search terms not only stored, but also in the occasion case will be passed on to third parties, and in these cases, law, there is no protection for the individual rights of the Internet Users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A prime example of this was recently action against pedophilia in Brazil, the Brazilian government in which Google überreichte the information gathered by the Community site called "Orkut," and also an identification of the Pädophilien enabled. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Personal rights users concerned but still aufatmen in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF successfully against the FBI drew in court: thus Google can also be in the future, not the constitution forced the FBI information on secret question. </seg>
<seg id="15"> (. However, the federal government has successfully understood the publication of 50,000 Webadressen and 1,000 search with reference to the years ago passed Youth Protection Act, but it has been denied the list of individual users, or their Web - and search term list two months retroactively.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Google's image remains so controversial: those who scorn their personal data not be issued because it by the use of the Google services the loss of their private and make-up of fear, the company with the conservative performing firms due indignation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, the American is "Geek-Kultur", which is present in many countries, and enthusiastic computer fans, unites activists, and users, the next generation of "coolen entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, that is thanks to Windows market leader, even if the two are fighting for the same goal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> A possible reason for this is that Google is its users, in contrast to Microsoft no identification codes, and his services available free of charge, so that an open constantly updated source code and programming package far more attractive, young and cool appear to be the official practices of the software giant. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the other hand, through the Geeks look the problematic relationship of individual rights and crack down the Internet knife - a relationship that is particularly in the past few years, thanks to the concept of "web 2 point 0" in the center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The "web 2 point 0" it is, in fact, nothing more than collaboration, in other words, the users leave deliberately traces and use the available channels of communication, and even if the individual proportions are different, the main thing remains the same: to show in public. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The average young people can at the same time, several Community portals manage its profile - from Facebook on Xanga, can this through other services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm link, and all of this, after all, in a Nachverfolgungs system such as Friend Feed or Blip.fm. Moreover, it can lead blogs, which are the latest photo galleries automatically on geostet Flickr and Picasa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> And a series of other demonstrates exemplary cases: Betrachten the party photos last night the girlfriend soon, with whom rubbing their disloyal friend has fired, or the staff, because he makes in his blog all too honest his anger at the corporate governance air - one thing is certain: the word "privacy" has now been interpreted entirely new. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Who is an online life, which is what he is price - as in, for example, could be the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And anyone who tried to keep secret, or even to circumvent the Google monopoly, can do that - such as with Scroogle, a Tool, which is on the search engine Google to stick, but deliberately no traces. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Not a few people register deliberately not at Community sides, so that they are not found, but also the online applications from Google, such as text processing and graphically tools and RSS-Feeds, deal with alternative versions, which are bound by no huge server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile from users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Public opinion is waiting, however, contained, Google shows her true colors. </seg>
<seg id="27"> With its current value of $ 156 billion, the company is even before IBM (140 billion USD), Intel ($ 124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($ 110 billion), the advertising land of AdWords and AdSense threaten the revenue of the advertising agencies, and the ever faster introduced services not only Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Critical spectator but also the disturbing subject a Pole: the company has led a protest of the staff rejected entirely after the fees of their own firms have been doubled kindergarten, also said the management, frequent meals of the staff was too costly. All of this but seems downright mild against the fact that Google in 2006, even before the Chinese government to its knees, and was in agreement with an agreement that all dissident hits, or those who violate the good taste, filtered out. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The internal rules of the group is that in advance will be no new service advertised, but only if they could already is available, but the events in the coming months and years some strong intended to completely change: while some believe Google's book and magazine scan showed - or archiving project now take proportions that the company would soon with the Supreme Court to address, so others are much more because of the system "Health worried" that the establishment of full health profile on the basis of diseases, doctors and problems. </seg>
<seg id="30"> And the fact that Google is building a genetic database of the next generation the Sci-Fi authors is already the stuff, "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow described in great Orwellian fashion a future in which a man, thanks to Google personal data terrifying nahbar. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> What would be the best way to develop new technologies to accident prevention, if not the obstacle to imitate sensors from the nature? </seg>
<seg id="3"> For example, the bees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the CEATEC Japan was presented a striking project, in which the Nissan engineers from Hummeln in creating new accident were inspired vermeidender systems. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In cooperation with the Tokyo University of Nissan has managed biomimetische system of car robotic humans type BR23C built a mini car, equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the air, each bee is their own oval "private sector," said our own "shield" is very similar to Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for Technologie-PR research and development of the exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The composite eye of the bee that can see in every direction, and in a corner of more than 300 degrees, playing an important role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The function of the composite eye to imitate the researchers, the idea of the laser controlled distance diameter. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This identified obstacles before the BR23C in an angle field of 180 degrees within 2 metres, calculated their distances and sends signals to the board Mikroprozessor, immediately avoided a collision process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The barrier will be registered in a split second, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees by the tyre revolve around the corner. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In contrast to previous systems will take place this purely instinctively maneuvers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "If it were not so, the car robots could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the "mobility Laboratory (" and the Autoroboter-Projektes. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The system must respond instinctively and immediately, because this technology to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a shift in the accidents still considered inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if they avoid other bees. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And in a split second. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> But can the branching out, in contrast to the bees, not upwards, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction of the Wendbarkeit the tyre. </seg>
<seg id="17"> While the bees infinitely many options open in order to avoid other bees, researchers could only in car robot is the central movement, or of speeding up and Abbremsens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BR23C Lithium-Polymerbatterien are easier and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer life than traditional Lithium-Ionenbatterien. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Andoh said it is on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of data, and even less to the ability to store them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> This device must process per second only a few inputs and respond to them. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It does not have to store or on the basis of previous exercises produce an intuitive, logical response, so that it constantly just a handful of KB Memory. </seg>
<seg id="22"> There is no need for gigabits - and serious megabyte Memories. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is the first step in the development of the immediate Kollisionsvermeidungstechnologie, according to estimates by Nissan in the next ten years series will be in production. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The compromise reached on the bailout backed both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the outcome: the programme will be effective and efficient, but we must do even more rumzureißen. According to Pelosi if it were not for the rescue of Wall Street, but the helm of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, so Washington time Sunday evening 8.00 p.m. (Central European time Monday 2.00 a.m.), but has no high on the stock. </seg>

<seg id="11"> We are satisfied with the progress achieved during the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to protect our to stabilize markets and our economy, said Tony Fratto, a spokesman for the White House. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The program, however, deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush administration, according to which the $ 700 billion in bad for the purchase, with contaminated credit securities should be spent. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a first tranche is to be spent a maximum of half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages, with 250 billion are immediately available, after the Congress as expected on Monday, will vote on the issue. This sum for the purchase of contaminated credit worse securities are spent, and the other $ 100 billion, should decide the President. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The program will be reviewed by a own Commission, also a member of the President of the Federal Reserve. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of Congress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the spirit of the law the Treasury can also apply a combined tactics: it can at the same time, bad loans, mortgages, and with mortgages purchased securities, or other "toxic" loans. </seg>

<seg id="20"> We take the necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared to introduce the legislation as soon as it was signed, so Paulson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The bosses of troubled and now reliant on government aid banks can, however, expect that their self-handling mentioned in the Übersee-Slang unceremoniously "golden hand shaking," will be shortened by the government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> A reduction in the wages will only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury aushilft. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The reduction basically means that if the Department obtains in an auction, the "golden hand shaking taxed" will be deported, unless the outgoing banking chief in the pensions. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In the case of a direct buying the bad loans, the government will aggressively involved to ensure that managers salaries not be exaggerated. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The picture also heard that the existing treaties Golden hand shaking not be changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements so that the more people to participate in the programme. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This is the first case in American history that cuts in managers salaries will be regulated by law, the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee measure. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The elite is in danger </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The phenomenon had already revealed a few days ago, when the Chamber of Deputies against the 700 Milliarden-Dollar-Sparpaket of the White House agreed: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than to save the economy. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms the yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reported, as the crisis over the Republican party step divide, the increasingly divides in their old and moderate East Coast soul, always the state institutions, and the business community favoured and those neo-conservative "in Washington," and the world of finance is hostile, particularly in the south and centre of the states electorate wins. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This part of the party owes his rise, particularly the voice of the I mentioned above. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This is just mentioned example, however, only a small part of the big changes, which is the current economic earthquake announces or even already: not only in the United States, even across the West and perhaps even beyond that will be affected by these. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In both states, as well as in Europe seems to speed up the crisis the long feared events, which in these new conditions finally start to take shape and come to light. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first of these phenomena is the Neuentdeckung, the unseemly renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In fact, the crisis is a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to the abroad and manage an enormous amount of assets of individual households living in a single state. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This means an immediate political problem for the government: how to behave with the families involved, which is also a huge mass of voters. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The crisis seems so economically globally, politically it is almost purely at national level. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The political internationalism seems itself to be sidelined, and the right to have lost: the obvious evidence of this is given by the EU which, because of their bipolar in different national and international conflicts, a common way to know. </seg>
<seg id="12"> So now all with the intervention of their own state ; rescue plans, the new rules, and particularly distribution of aid fund: since the crisis has always been serious to save are only the United States in the economic situation without foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And in addition to the funds they have also to use the legitimacy of this: not, therefore, two überwertende conditions –, under certain circumstances, – what otherwise no international organization, and not a market in a similar way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The new emphasis on state national element is in line with the ever larger significance recently in the economy with a closely related sector associated: the territoriality. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Paradoxically, it is now, as we were so convinced long in a networked total happened to be in a range of always different technologies, Immateriellen, that we need to see how our future, but more and more will depend on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil. </seg>
<seg id="16"> These can be transported while to be sure, all from one place to the other in the world, but are yet to extreme with a closely associated umschriebenen piece of earth – a territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That is why the person who has such a territory, another, lives in a ernteertraglosen, wasserlosen or oil free area in the advantage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I now turn to the second novelty, but a brief digression. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Who territory, who government who says policy, saying leadership. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the one hand there is the recognition of the need for Distinguished Leader ships, so the need for someone who knows how things. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On the other hand, is now a wave of indignation about the existing leaders, particularly those of the economy, which have insufficient and full of shadow zones. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – cities are their historic cinemas </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The historic cinema close because of the beneficiary Multiplexkinos. </seg>
<seg id="3"> "A city with no cinemas is a blind city, as a face with no eyes." </seg>
<seg id="4"> This image of the film director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect as now in the large urban centres of Italy, and in the provinces, is happening. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The process of exclusion of cinema that began with the birth of the great Multisaalkomplexe in the periphery, in the long run, the death of the Einsaalkino in center. A process, not only seems inevitable and irreversibly, but also the traits of a cultural crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Affected mostly historical sites full of memories, "it is like to lose a friend with a piece of streets full of emotion has come," the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" him 20 years ago the Oskar and the big prize at Cannes, and it is the story of a suburban theatres and nostalgia, which it is to live in a well for ever lost cinema world. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The figures, which have Anec, the key industry association provides a clear language: in the last five years the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinema must close ; this bill paid for the most part, the cinema in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, in Turin, 6 and 5 in Palermo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The worst affected areas include the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This indicates that the main culprits are the Multiplexkinos, for it is precisely these three regions in which registered the largest number of these modern cinema: there with 195 in the last five years the Lombardy lists, 81, both in Tuscany in Emilia-Romagna. </seg>
<seg id="10"> " The business has evolved in an irrational manner, " Paolo Protti, the President of the Anec, " it is useful that new structures, but it is first and foremost the preservation of the already exist, because includes a room in the city are not all of his regular customers willing to pay, rather than the old one Multiplexkino in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And here is the lack of budget for the Fund's äußer industry associations: the recorded by the state debt burden is around 10 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a disgrace from an ethical and moral position that the government ignored the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In order to obtain the sector would be between 16 and 18 million euros in the year needed. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It is interesting to the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, because of fears that the old cinemas has decided to protect these through an agreement between the community and the Anec ; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support the traditional movie theatres, and both in the historic center and in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Among the imminence of the measures are also granting tax divisions for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the audience on the transportation: it will be allowed to drive in traffic from limited areas of the centre, and also to more favorable to park parking fees. </seg>
<seg id="16"> " It is a good initiative, " Giuseppe Tornatore, " I hope that other cities will follow our example and, moreover, still new design concepts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> To be sure, but we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to focus on the superpower of the Multiplexsäle, because, after all, the audience is more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The defense of the traditional cinema is for me has always been an important issue: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the tipping point me to create the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso," even if I have 10 years since had played with the idea. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For 25 years, I live in Rome ; if I am on the Rialto or at the Quirinale, in the Via Nazionale, where I have lived through many different emotions, I try to the side so as not to see the dust covered posters. </seg>
