Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee 
What would be the best method of the development of new technologies on the accident avoidance, if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from the nature? 
For example, those of the bees. 
With the CEATEC in Japan an astonishing project with which the Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees with the creation new accident of avoiding systems was introduced. 
In collaboration with the Tokioter university Nissan has built the biomimetische system steered by autorobots of the type BR23C, a mini-car, equipped with the qualities of the bees, with the purpose to support the development of a system which avoids any collisions. 
In the flight every bee forms her own, oval "private area" which is very similar to our own "shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, with the exhibit. 
Besides, the compound eye of the bee which can see in every direction and in a corner of more than 300 degrees plays an important role. 
To copy the function of the compound eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-steered distance knife. 
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates her distances and sends signals to the microprocessor in Board which initiates immediately the collision-avoiding process. 
The obstacle is registered in split seconds, and the autorobot changes immediately the course, like the movement of the bees, while he turns the tyres around the suitable corner. 
In contrast to present systems this manoeuvre takes place purely instinctively. 
" If it was not in such a way, the autorobot could not react fast enough to make way to the obstacles ", explained Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of "Mobility Laboratory" and the autorobot-project. 
The system must react instinctively and immediately, because this technology corresponds to the most internal and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents count nowadays still as inevitable. 
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees if they make way to other bees. 
And this must run off in the fraction of one second. 
Indeed, the elusiveness, in contrast to the bees, not can occur up, down, or even diagonally - it can be two-dimensional only, namely only in the direction of the Wendbarkeit of the tyres. 
While many possibilities are open to the bees here endlessly to make way to other bees, the researchers could help themselves with the autorobot only of the rotary movement, or the acceleration and Abbremsens. 
The BR23C contains lithium-polymer batteries which are light and more energy-efficient, and, hence, have a longer life span, than customary lithium-ion batteries. 
Andoh explained, it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of the data, and still less on the ability on storing this. 
This device must process per second merely some input and react accordingly to them. 
It must not store this, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction with the help of earlier manoeuvres, so that it takes up constantly only a handful of KB Memory. 
It requires no heavy to gigabyte and memo ream heavy to megabyte. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology which will be according to appraisal of Nissan within the next ten years serially in production. 
An other application could find the technology with the satellite navigation GPS, while it steers the driver consciously round obstacles and leads him thus in the purpose.
