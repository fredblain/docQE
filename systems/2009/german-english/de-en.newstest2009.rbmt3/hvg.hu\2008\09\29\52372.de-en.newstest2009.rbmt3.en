extraction failed 
On the 8th October the negotiations begin in the criminal trial against J�nos surcharge and his accomplices. 
In particular the participation in the organized crime, as well as roughly careless damage and commercial deception, and other punishable actions - is accused of the defendants, among the rest, document forgery. 
According to public prosecutor's office the means lukrierten from the advertisings were used for own purposes, while the produced achievements were often covered with phoney calculations. 
State money and subsidies of the self-government - all together HOOF 65 Mil. - should have flowed partly into the cashes of organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the private cashes single. 
As the inquiry authorities announced, fictive calculations were presented while covering the advertising money, and the associations should also not have followed to her duties. 
According to indictment a large part of the calculations should have been faked. 
The calculation blocks were bought in the market from J�zsefv�ros, one let the round seals make in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision on it on which companies the calculations should be issued was decided on that tour to the north of flat lake on which Istv�n Lados was sent by J�nos surcharge. 
In the course of this "investigation tour" Lados pensions and restaurants should find. 
He required calculations about the Konsumationen to be able to issue calculations for the youth ministry and sports ministry, the Ministry of social security and Department of Employment, as well as the self-government of Budapest later on these presentations based. 
These calculations should go by the majority from Istv�n Lados and his accomplice, Andr�s? have been manipulated ri and should have been responsible latter according to our information for the constitution of the suitable reports. 
One of the purposes of Lados' "investigation tour" was a beer bar. 
How two calculations issued by Zuschlag und Co in 2003 is to be taken, the catering trade company should have entertained the 90-headed group of the association Biztos Pont Egyes�let. 
Now, however, the boss of the company brags, a so big group would not have fitted all at once into the bar. 
Another calculation, issued in summer, 2002 on the endowment Working J�v? �rt, later famously than Egy�tt a Harmadik �vezred�rt, showed likewise serious form and contents mistakes. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj which orders merely more than three rooms and can accommodate no more as ten persons at the same time 130 guests should have stayed according to calculation. 
No borders were put apparently also to the imagination of the calculation forgers when it was about the Pigal Kft., a catering trade company, in accounting documents of customers Jobb J�v? �rt and Hopp� only do not appear according to accusation authority at all. 
How manager Gy? z? Farkas hvg.hu informed, was clear to him immediately that it concerned phoney documents when documents were presented to him of the public prosecutor's office during questioning. 
" Our company name and the tax number were right on the stamp wrong ". 
And further: Apart from form mistakes the fact was also wrong that the company should have accommodated 100 persons, after they have a total of eleven rooms which offer place impossibly so to many persons. 
Also catering has been stated on the calculation, besides, the restaurant is since longer time no more in company. 
The industrious calculation forgers have also neglected to check that from them in the visor taken Budapester travel agency offers exclusively traveling abroad, and thus they have given Hungary traveling on the cash payment calculation what likewise contradicted the calculation lapping practise of the company. 
How in the course of the inquiries became known, in addition, they have stated on the calculations also the value added tax, although the travel agency achievements which refer to a land beyond the EU are free of value added tax. 
The height of the value added tax was all together on four of hotel R�vf�l�p Kft to the endowment Working J�v? �rt to issued calculations wrong, because the company instead of 25 only 15 percent of VAT settles, in addition, are issued by the employees exclusively machine calculations, nevertheless, the phoney documents were handwritten. 
Another mistake which had occurred the "Rechnungslegern" was him that they had bragged in a case "goods transport" as a produced achievement, although this is not offered by the company specified on investment consultation, informed the public prosecutor's office. 
To other form mistakes - wrong calculation format, wrong stamp - was to be owed, that in Egy�tt a Harmadik �vezred�rt Alap�tv�ny, as well as in XXI. Sz�zadi Kultur�lis Egyes�let and Biztos Pont to issued calculations as forgeries could be exposed. 
Also to never have issued the calculations in case of the Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfeh�rt� whose managers protested. 
Another "mistake" has occurred the forgers with the HIB Kft. from Ny�regyh�za: This society was at the time (2001) since just in resolution when the group of the Fiatal V�ros�rt Egyes�let should have eaten there - consequently the mass governor indicated not to have issued the calculations independently. 
Consciously phoney 
The other group him Calculation-casually are persons, to those was absolutely aware that they would have to lay fictive calculations. 
On request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj� Szocialist�k has the endowment Es�ly Budapest�rt Alap�tv�ny calculations for the endowment Egy�tt a Harmadik �vezred�rt, at a height of possibly HOOF 4 Mil. issued. 
According to indictment the manager of the Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy�rfi, to the exhibit of the fictive calculations. 
The biogate at the moment likewise located in liquidation Kft. also should go with Zuschlag und Co. have cooperated: In 2003 the Ltd should the endowment Working J�v? �rt Alap�tv�ny, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyes�let and V�r�sfeny? Egyes�let with phoney calculations in the total value of HOOF 5 Mil. have supplied which referred to not produced achievements. 
However, there were just as few payments, because the calculations were cancelled immediately after her exhibit what the affected persons in her documents, nevertheless, have forgotten to note. 
The third group him encloses Calculation-casually persons who are associated immediately with the defendants. 
One of them is Iv�n Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian manager the delta Tri� Kft., one in Budapest to resident, there, nevertheless, not discoverable fuel and vehicle business enterprise. 
This company should have issued in the period December, 2005 several calculations about the sales of EDP components in the total value of HOOF to about 18 Mil. 
According to inquiry authority located Cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas should have acted since the 14th September, 2005 in liquidation as a buyer of these calculations. 
Manager of this company was a Rumanian to whom the company documents should be likewise blocked by Iv�n Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information Kubatov has stood during the inquiries, calculations in the name of the Ltd. to have taken the money to the associations Atlasz and Hopp�, as well as in Egy�tt a Harmadik �vezred�rt Alap�tv�ny issued and their equivalent independently. 
Companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft as well as the Jos investment Bt. should have been founded by Roumanian bricklayers on Iv�n Kubatovs explicit wish there. 
Nevertheless, in truth none of these companies was active what lay according to defendant with lacking orders. 
Still he could profit from the enterprises: On request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente who was instructed with the preparation of the company foundation documents he has exhibited in the name of the proficient calculations to the associations associated with surcharge, as for example in Atlasz and Y-Gener�ci�. 
All together Kubatov should have issued 15 calculations in the total value of HOOF 14.2 Mil. in the name of companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri�, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations. 
The public prosecutor's office assumes from the fact that Kubatov could have collected in each case 10% of the amount payable as well as the value added tax. 
Kubatov should have abused even company Szi-Beri Bt for the exhibit of fictive calculations - in this case the calculations were added to the applications by Biztos Pont. 
Company Y-Gener�ci� and Sz�vets�g a Modern Magyarorsz�g�rt have delivered in January, 2006 her applications at the charitable organization of the socialist party, T�ncsics Mih�ly Alap�tv�ny ("TMA"). 
Both received 500,000 Forint, have used these amounts, nevertheless, misappropriated. 
To cover up this, they have presented the TMA five fictive calculations of the Works to team Kft. 
These calculations were guaranteed, by the way, by the search of the office from � rp�d Kemecsei in the teaching ministry. 
Now at the negotiations it is calculated by some defendants with a confession about the approach of the calculation forgery, as they were already filed before the public prosecutor's office. 
A sensation could be, if main defendant J�nos surcharge decides on a comprehensive confession. 
His present information was specified since less, and although he had already accepted several times to report extensively about everything, his confession is still pending. 
The question stays open whether this lies in his interest whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the reparation of the large part of the resulted damage of HOOF 50 Mil., and whether surcharge is ready as a countermove to take over the responsibility. 
However, it is absolutely possible that surcharge plays now the "offended", after his requests had bumped into alleviation of the arrest and house arrest on deaf ears. 
While the other criminals who have far arranged bigger damage with economic offenses and have not compensated for this, at large or stand at least under house arrest, surcharge remains this possibility kept.
