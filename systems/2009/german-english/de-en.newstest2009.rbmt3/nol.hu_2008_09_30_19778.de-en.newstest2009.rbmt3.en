Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0 
By the choices on Sunday no representative of the opposition has created it in the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers mean, this lies with the prosperity and stability in the land controlled by Alexander Lukashenko, however, the OECD supposes unlawful acts with the counting up of the voices. 
The OECD which has sent 450 observers from 43 lands has not recognized the choices. 
Indeed, De legislation of the 10-millions-inhabitant's state gets by since decades without opposition. Gathered opposition has still seriously expected itself under the name " combined democratic forces " (ODS) before the yesterday's choices that Lukashenko who renewed in 2006 his presidency mandate by the squalid choices and thanks to a constitutional amendment already for the fourth time would "admit" this time some representatives of the opposition in the parliament. 
Therefore, the ODS has forborn even from the before planned boycotts. 
The Ukraine becomes economically more and more dependent thanks to the rising prices with the natural gas import of Russia. For the relief of the prize increases even loans were taken up, and the land has also agreed to the disposal of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the land, to the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition there stood hope, the Ukraine wants to improve her relation with the EU, after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have entry ban because of the anti-democratically classified political system in the EU. 
The evaluation report of the choices of the OECD in which the stress lay rather on the positive movements, instead of on the defects - as for example the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates of the choices - provided for a passing relaxation. 
Indeed, the quick report of the OECD already on Monday criticized the campaign - therefore, members of the opposition might not seem in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition might not be present with the counting up of the voices. 
In spite of all that the opposition is capable of an improvement in the political system recognize: Political prisoners were put possibly on free foot, and Minsk is ready even for smaller confrontations with Moscow, while it was refused furthermore the recognition of the independence of the unfaithful Georgian provinces S�d-Ossetien and Abchasien, although Russia with which the Ukraine on the paper forms a F�derativstaat looks at both areas since one month as independent. 
" We have done two steps forward and backward, but the most important is that the dialog has begun between Byelorussia and the EU ", said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our sheet. 
In the opinion of the opposition candidate of the presidency choices of 2006 a continuation is desirable, although " have got the mighty fear to let even a member of the opposition in the parliament ". 
The opposition plans no protest measures in view of the results, but tries to make clear rather the necessity of an economic reform to the voters. 
" We have to fight here with many problems - the oppositional newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities lay stones in the way to us with the distribution, but still I see that more and more people support the change, even older " - Milinkewitsch said in allusion on the fact that the most-supported layer of the pensioners not even agrees with the Lukashenko's regime whose only salary is the production of social security. 
" Thanks to the indebtedness of the land and the increase of the commercial deficit it is only a question of the time to which to the silence of a cemetery reminding " social security " starts to crumble ", according to Milinkewitsch. 
In contrast to opposition politician Russian observers have called the choices democratic. 
Sergei Lebedev, leader of the mission of the community of independent states explained to news agency Ria Novosti: " The people believe the actions, and not the words ". Hence, the absence of the opposition is a proof of the maturity of the Belorussian voters.
