HSV hits brook Glad 1:0 
With a gate and simple methods become the Hamburg league leaders SV. 
With the Borussia Luhukay does not succeed furthermore in finding a functioning Eleven. 
From Kristoffer Small increase crash landing for national player Marko Marin. 
The Gladbacher came into play only late and failed with a siphon because of the slat. 
His message was formulated exactly, persuasive she went for him over the lips. 
He knew absolutely that he was right. 
" We need the second gate ", Hermann Rieger hissed in the cabin way of the Hamburg arena. 
A lot was not loose in the catacombs, the half time break was finished and most sat again on her places. 
Rieger was nearly three decades a physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a higher respect than some ex-actor. 
And thus his request also found hearing at responsible place. 
Assistance coach Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted in the affirmative the thumb. 
Cornelius is the brother of coach of Hamburg Martin Jol. 
His order will have similarly been: Here with gate two! 
The conversion was missing. 
" Today there everything was not to be looked nicely ", admitted Marcell Jansen later. 
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have wished it " more relaxed ". 
The inhabitants of Hamburg have to owe 1:0 (1:0) to the header hit of Mladen Petric (11).; and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak inhabitants of Hamburg. 
" It was a dirty victory ", Martin Jol summarized. 
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old on this Monday. 
The spectators celebrated on Saturday afternoon already once themselves, the blue sky about the arena and the flash table on the videowall which expelled her association as a class top of the class. 
It will become a birthday without real party. 
" We know how to arrange this ", said Marcell Jansen. 
He anticipates that the tabular end of term report stands more for the unpredictability of the league, than for the dominance of his HSV. 
Indeed, the team with her late obliged accesses - to the Brazilians Neves and Silva, to the goal scorer Petric as well as the Jansen poached by Bavaria FC - is found slowly to shine, however, she is not capable yet. 
" We need more atmosphere and more Dribblings ", demanded Jol.
