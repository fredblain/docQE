Questions after the accident: Are stewards unlawful in the bus? 
The law does not know them, in a distant coach running around is not permitted 
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the society student Agency near the Italian Padua the question positions itself whether stewards and travelers may during the journey in the bus hin-and herlaufen. 
" If we wanted to keep strictly and formally to the law, the activity of a steward stands in the contradiction to the law about the traffic ", according to the speaker of the traffic ministry Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident in which the last week a 22-year-old stewardess died was probably caused by the driver of the LKWs who crossed the way to the bus. 
The young woman sat at this moment to all misfortune beside the driver, on on the least sure place in the car, although she had at disposal another two other places. 
However, a bus can also have at the moment an accident or brake sharply in which the steward delivers coffee or newspapers. 
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped after the vehicle letter also with standing places. 
If this is not planned in the bus, the travelers must sit. 
The distant coaches of student Agency have no standing places; what the manager of the company, Radim Jan? ura, compared with Aktu�ln? .cz confirmed. 
" We have discussed this with the ministry, and this has not agreed first to the movement of travelers. 
Later one has taken back this, and we have reached to a consensus after which the travelers may go during the journey on the toilet if they have her seat ", he informed of his point of view. 
The law knows no steward 
" There is no unequivocal juridical interpretation for the role of a steward - no statutory regulation describes this role. 
However, there is also no statutory regulation which forbids to the Bef�rderer to produce services. 
The law about the traffic knows only the concept Vehicle companion; it does not define his rights and duties, nevertheless, ", the speaker of ministry Hanzelka adds unambiguously. 
The manager of the department of street vehicles of the traffic ministry Josef Pokorn �, however, thinks that the law covers these problems afterwards. 
" It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product licensing. 
Then this is everything ", he stresses. 
Buses divide themselves into town buses where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, close traffic buses with standing places and a higher permissible speed and distant coaches without standing places at the highest allowed speed and seats which are equipped with seat belts. 
As in the airplane, says the expert 
The BESIP expert for road safety Jaroslav Ho? �n sees in the movement of stewards aboard a bus no basic problem. 
" With a liquid driving manner do not threaten many dangers, the situation is comparable with the service aboard an airplane. 
Also here is not sure, when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can knock herself the head. " 
" If a bus brakes, nevertheless, sharply, the laws of physics also count of course. 
Just like in the town bus or in a streetcar. 
The Bef�rderer must clear the security of the stewards by internal regulations ", he says and thinks also that these problems are solved from the point of the law not completely. 
Jan? ura it is ready to stroke the services 
Student Agency offers services of stewards as the only bus company. 
The company occupies about 200 persons in this function. 
The manager looks at her occupation also after the accident not as risk-laden. 
" As soon as I gets, however, the impression that the occupation of the steward is risk-laden, I will stroke him. 
Coffee and newspapers can receive the travelers while getting. 
This would also lower the costs ", he thinks. 
As an interest in the security the manager of Asiana Alexej Litvin founds the absence of stewards in his buses. However, his society pursues only one fraction of lines in comparison to student Agency. 
" We have no stewardesses, we defend ourselves against it right from the start. 
Sooner or later this ends with any deadly accident ", he had expressed before not completely one year for T � den.cz. 
This was an unbelievable tragedy 
In the accident of a line bus to Naples a young stewardess from the region Pilsen which had worked two years for the society had had an accident. 
The Slovenian TRUCK was probably without flashing from the state stripe bent and had obstructed to the bus the journey. 
The driver of the bus tried to make way by a sharp manoeuvre, nevertheless, collided with the right front part with the TRUCK. 
The fact that two places have been sold for the stewards, does Jan deny? ura. 
" These places cannot be reserved with distant connections, they are blocked. " 
Company wants to sue truck driver. 
With a compensation of the family of the young woman the agency will not wait for the court judgment, she expects a financial damage substitute, however, also from sides of the culprit. 
A law change? 
Not by view 
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards aboard a bus could bring a legal regulation on which a 30-headed expert's team of the traffic ministry already works about a year. 
" However, this has still reached to no concrete end. 
Buses also stand not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones in the journey ", according to expert Ho? �n. 
" The traffic ministry looks at the activity of the stewards not as something which could substantially endanger the security of the travelers ", according to Hanzelka and the control of the security of the buses lies in the competence of the police and the industrial safety authorities.
