Sleepless nights for believer of the Hypo Real Estate 
The German bank system is relatively stable, stressed federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbr�ck only in pastly week. 
How well that the politician used the word "relatively" and also still twined that the German bank sector is not spared by the crisis-like developments. 
Since now it has entered on the week-end. 
The Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo taken down in the Dax Real Estate (HRE) receives from a syndicate of German banks a billion loan to shelter from the turbulence in the markets. 
A person close with the situation said Reuters on Monday, the loan support amounted on up to 35 billion euros. 
The Hypo Real Estate must pay interest only on the part which it also takes up. 
The money comes from private as well as public law banks. 
A background are losses with the daughter Depfa. 
The Staatsfinanzierer had itself according to a newspaper report for long term projects for which he has lent money, extremely at short notice refinanziert - what is no more possible because of the mistrust in the markets, in the meantime. 
In the first half-year in 2008 the cash reserve of the bank had shrunk about 95 percent on 2.37 million euros, also the company capital rate had easily given from 1.6 to 1.45 percent. 
The running yields and the Nettoertr�ge from finance shops had liked compared with the year before period on zero, had sunk the yields from writings up to demands and certain securities as well as from the resolution of transfers to reserve in the loan business by more than 70 percent on 5 million euros. 
Only thanks to higher yields from allowances of poststored settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as from the allowance of interest after the tax code and from the commercial provision for group enterprise, the profit deficit with about 16 percent still allowed to be moderate. 
The formerly Staatsfinanzierer had itself after his privatisation in 1990 at first with commercial real estate loans verspekuliert which had been separated then in the Aareal bank. 
Because one earned in the classical state financing not enough, then the Depfa had been involved increasingly in infrastructure projects and the financing of communal projects of private investors and the state (Partner-hip, PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. 
Now on the value of the daughter the Hypo Real Estate must carry out the write-offs which will have an " essential material effect " on the profit and loss calculation of the group hotly rather vaguely. 
Fact is that the dividend was stroked. 
Already for 2007 it had been shortened by two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate is a significant state and Infrastrukturfinanzierer since the Depfa takeover. 
She is stronger than other institutes of the Refinanzierung in the interbank market dependent, because she has no customer inserts. 
With the breakdown of American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the grant of credit has dried up under the banks again to a great extent, because the banks hoard her liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs yearly for a part - about 50 billion euros - the loan port folio of the Depfa short-term means to the Refinanzierung. 
After communication of the Hypo Real Estate, the financing need of the group is covered with the loan for foreseeable time and the enterprise is guarded " by the influence of the international monetary markets widely functional-incapable nowadays ". 
From other springs is to be heard that thanks to the money the Refinanzierung would be protected till the end of 2009. 
The HRE chairman of the board Georg Funke explained, against it that the Hypo Real Estate Group the monetary markets for foreseeable time will have to take up no more. 
Central Bank and the federal institution for finance service supervision (BaFin) assume from the fact that now the market ability of the Hypo Real Estate group would be protected. 
This is for stockholders and believers of the bank to hope. 
But in view of the dynamism and imponderabilities of the crisis there is probably no certainty. 
It is not even inconceivable that the financing must not be taken up in full circumference. 
But also the opposite is not auszuschlei�en. 
After on late Sunday evening after report the bank stood still before the insolvency, the at least temporary rescue is also not able to calm the minds. 
The stock course breaks about 75 percent on 3.30 euros. 
Right the loan courses well keep against it. 
If the priority debts last to themselves barely moved point, give way the courses of the postrank-loans more clearly. 
Above all the loans of the earlier daughter's company Wurttemberg Hypo and understandable-wise the terms going out 2009 are concerned. 
To lights Hypo-Real-Estate-Anleihen formerly a speculative investment alternative, their Werthaltigkeit must be looked after the clear increase of the bank crisis and the institute which had got the crisis only in the house, as from the stability of the international financial system with the takeover of the Depfa dependent. 
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less groggy commercial banks are still ready for the support of the system, as long as can be gone out from a fristgem��en erasure of the pensions. 
Or, however, it stamps in this what dares to hope nowadays hardly somebody - that the financial crisis is overcome during the coming 15 months. 
However, in view of the announcements overturning with the partial nationalization only one entitled hope has become from the likelyhood bordering in security nowadays. 
This might prepare above all for Langzeitgl�ubigern some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate from her engagements. 
Short-term investors can use a final line, at least, in addition to form a loss carried forward for the future payment tax payments on course profits of later years.
