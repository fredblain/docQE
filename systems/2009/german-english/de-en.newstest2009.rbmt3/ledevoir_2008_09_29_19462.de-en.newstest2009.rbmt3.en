Free opinion - the orwellsche speech of Barrick gold 
In her issue from the 17th September Le Devoir published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice general manager of the Canadian golden mine Barrick gold. 
This confirms, and, besides, pursues an orwellsche logic that the biggest golden production society of the world aimed at an action for slander more than six millions against three authors and a small impecunious publishing house, with the purpose to open a ` public transparent debate '. 
If it is right that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge about the truth, above all not in the case of actions for slander, but about the law. 
As expected, this basic difference was completely hid by Mr. Garver. 
Since for Barrick gold the best kind a public debate is to be led to do everybody in the ruin which dares to represent one of the opinion opposite to her. 
No matter how the process goes out which authors and the publishers of the book Noir Canada substantial sums will have to be economical to prepare her defense and to fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid from the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the golden mine. 
The tactics in these unequal fights is often, for the rest to ruin the defenders to force a concerted regulation which silences the opposition and deters, in addition, everybody which dares to deal once more with the question. 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public debate, it would have had to present her view of the things before the public opinion. 
By contrast what is quite usual in many of the lands in which Barrick gold works, debates are delivered in Canada ordinarily by the exchange of ideas and not by bat slashes. 
It would have been enough if the golden mine had disclosed her books and acts and had opened a real debate, by the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams which could have brought light in this question. 
But Barrick gold seems to have no trust in the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to the support of the authors of Noir Canada with a movement of the hand aside. 
Mr. Garver maybe explain ��߬����� can he ask at the same time for a 'public' debate and, besides, nevertheless, the opinions just of this general public ignore? 
Apparently this word in the world of the vice-president encloses only the generously paid-up lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a quite a lot cramped perception of the concept. 
In a democracy even slanderers the right have to speak. 
What does not understand Barrick gold - or does not want to understand - is that the general public which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this above all, because she rejects the crude posture of the golden mine. 
This general public is ready to listen Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a frame which many perceive as a toggle complaint (in the course of the ` public debate ' Barrick gold has directed just a demand to the authors of Noir Canada in whom she requires of them to use this concept no more ...). 
Apart from the surreal speech of Mr. Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct attack on the freedom to the academic research and the Wahrheitsfindung which are basically for every democratic society. 
She completely denies the right to quote plausible springs and to discuss facts and interpretations which form the base of the intellectual work. 
If it is impossible in a land like Canada to investigate subjects and to discuss which the rich enterprises of this world do not like who can do, otherwise, this then? 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public and clear debate, it could lead this, while she follows the scientific norms which were used by the authors of Noir Canada. 
She has to answer a right. 
The universit�re sphere to which we belong knows how to gain control for a long time to solve debates and discrepancies and conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold shows clearly that it, in contrast to that what she gives has no desire for a clear debate. 
This is a loss for the university world, just like for the public debate, and it time that the governments seize measures will limit the of such type unwarranted complaints.
