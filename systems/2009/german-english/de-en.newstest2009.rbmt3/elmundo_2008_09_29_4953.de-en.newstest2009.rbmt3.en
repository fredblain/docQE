In the sleep talk 
At night some children speak 
I mine not those which wake and tell to us, besides, something what has happened during the day before it, but the children, which speak during the sleep. 
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will have got a fright, but in the reality that has no meaning. 
This is a positive sleeping disturbance which is called the speech in the sleep. 
It is quite spread, above all with the children and youngsters. 
Absolutely, it was told more than to one of you that at night you have spoken. 
This phenomenon can appear as occasional (once in the life, for example, how during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once per week, once in the month �), the next day the child can remember nothing. 
There is no reason which causes this appearance. 
Connections with other phenomena are often searched in the sleep, like nightmares, panic fear at night, Enuresis noctura (bed-wetting at night), speech in the sleep in request, but it gives no reason for it. 
As we have mentioned it already earlier, it can lie with very much high fiber, stress situations or excessive demand. 
Anyway, is the a little investigated phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it appears is very variable. 
It can be that one speaks quietly in single words, whispers or it an opposite can completely be (shouts, to wines, long discussions �). 
In the cases if the statement is very intensive it is recommended to observe the child and to let discuss with a specialist to check whether a problem is which causes fear and comes about in this manner. 
We have said that it is a positive disturbance, thus it is not treated, it is, it is connected with another sleeping disturbance which can be treated (for example, with the Schlaf-Apnoe or with the stress). 
What one is able to do is, a series of easy preventive measures carry out: 
Do not try to excite the child before sleeping. 
Thus, quiet play for the child select and avoid stressful television programs which are awful and too wild a little bit. 
With the nervous children to whom Entspannungen are recommended relaxation methods can be applied to help them, to get a certain internal rest. 
This helps the child to sleep quietly. 
If the speech seems in the sleep once, the rest tries to preserve. 
Remembers that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will be able to remember nothing what has happened. 
useful advice 
Do not wake it. 
This is useless, because the child is unaware, you will tear it from the sleep. 
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, thus it rests. 
Remembers if it is scrared after a pair of phenomena, is recommended to let discuss or to find out which reason the child has for the fear. 
If they understand what says it (what is not so usual), the child does not put under pressure to carry out an examination and to get out more information. 
Thus you will be able to reach with it nothing because if the child sleeps, it is unaware and cannot think about it. 
In addition, you will hear what says it, but you will not know what dreams it and why it says this, so, they are carefully with the interpretation of the information and the ends which you pull from it. 
Maybe, one does not say to the child that at night you hear this and know his secrets. 
Not even as a joke. 
This causes a lot of fear. 
Thus, does to you no worries, it is nothing bad, this is a moment which lasts only few minutes.
