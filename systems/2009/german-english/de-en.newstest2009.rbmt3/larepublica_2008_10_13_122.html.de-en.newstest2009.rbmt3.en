Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso? the towns close her historical film halls 
The historical cinemas close on account of the preferred multiplex cinemas. 
" A town without film halls is a blind town, how a face without eyes. " 
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes what at the moment in the big urbane centers of Italy with effect, and also happens in the provinces. 
The process of the exclusion of the cinemas which began with the birth of the big multi hall complexes in the periphery signifies in the long term the death for the Einsaalkino in the center. A process which seems inevitable not only and irrevocable but also the trains of a cultural crime carries. 
Mostly historical places of full recollections are concerned, " it is like a friend to lose with whom one has put back a piece of street of full emotions ", according to the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso who introduced the Oskar and the big price of Cannes in him 20 years ago. It concerns the history of a suburban cinema and his nostalgia which insists on living in a probably film world lost for good. 
The figures which speak the Anec which delivers central trade federation, a clearly language: during the last five years had to close the immense amount from 316 traditional cinemas; the cinemas paid for the most part this bill in the big towns: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
The Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed from Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41 belong to the strongest affected regions. 
This testifies of the fact that the major offenders are the multiplex cinemas, because these are just these three regions in which the biggest number of these modern cinemas was registered: with 195 during the last 5 years Lombardy states the lists, 81 are it in Tuscany as well as in the Emilia-Romagna. 
" The business has developed in an irrational way ", indeed, thus Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, " it helps that also new structures arise, however, firstly, there stands the preservation of the quite existing, then a hall closes in the town, all his regular customers are ready not to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one. 
And here the missing budget still remains for the ground of the trade federation �u�er Eight: the debts registered by the state amount to approx. 10 million euros. 
It is a disgrace of the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not follow the existing laws. 
To receive the sector, would be between 16 and 18 million euros in the year of miseries ". 
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian town which has decided on account of the fears around the old film halls to protect this by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it concerns the first agreement of this kind in Italy which is designed to protect the traditional cinemas and to support, and this in the historical center, as well as in the periphery. 
Under the foreseen measures tax Bevorteilungen are also for the film operators as well as advantages for the audience with regard to the close traffic: it will be allowed to go in the traffic-limited areas of the center and to park, in addition, to more favorable park fees. 
" It is a gratifying initiative ", according to Giuseppe Tornatore, " I hope that other towns to our example will join and sketch, in addition, still new drafts. 
Indeed, however, we also need a better audioequipment and videoequipment to be able to straighten something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because today, in the end, the audience from is more demanding. 
The defense of the traditional cinema has been for me always an important subject: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point which brought me, to found "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even if I had already played for 10 years with the thought. 
For 25 years I live in Rome; if I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside not to have to see the dust-overcast posters.
