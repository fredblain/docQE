` Sangre de mayo ': Heroic book of Garci 
Inspires from ` Episodios Nacionales' of Benito P�rez Gald�s, Jos� Luis Carci shows the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in ` Sangre de mayo '. This is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with approximately 15 million euros of investment for the shooting. 
In this manner the cineaste has tried to explain ` today an amount from personalities and social analysis ' what he has admired always in the works of the famous novelist explained Carci by the presentation of the film with Quim Guti�rrez and Paula Echevarr�a at the beginning of a long list of the actors. 
` Sangre de mayo ' with a film length of more than 2,5 hours, is presented this Friday in cinemas and is shown later on transmitter Telemadrid than one 4-hour miniseries. 
Jos� Luis Garci, big fan of the literature of Gald�s, assures that thanks to this rotary work his 'childhood dream' went to fulfilment. He has to owe this to Esperanza Aguirre which asked him three years ago of the autonomous community Madrid to turn a commemorative film to the second century celebration on the 2nd November in Madrid. Above all because the history is based on the basis of ` Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order. 
The whole contribution of 15 millions which was put by the autonomous community Madrid for shooting offers Garci as he added, the ` unique possibility ' with the help of decorations and suitable clothings the picture of ` confused Spain which selected the wrong leader for the fight because the people by the fight for the independence and under the rule of the Ferdinands of VII in remains brought had become to explain '. 
However, the cineaste regrets that one could not count on the financing like with 'Alatriste' or ` lot fantasmas de of Goya' (two times high as with ` Sangre de mayo '), so, some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valc�rcel with whom Garci almost his whole career cooperated could not. 
That's why, Garci who was also a film manager in ` Volver a empezar ' has helped by his usual approach: he positioned himself on the stage to the actors with whom one must rehearse first before one starts to turn and for those which had done no casting, he seemed 'mortifying' and respect getting, ` a part of the occupation of the film manager consists in performing help in the theater and in the cinema to know what happens in the film industry in which one works. ' 
Many actors into whom he bumps in ` Sangre de mayo ' must repeat before his camera, like in the case of Miguel Rell�n, Carlos Larra�aga or Fernando Guill�n Cuervo. 
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (from which he has won one) is of the opinion and assured that none of three candidates who represent Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year shows a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Neither ` Sangre de mayo ', nor ` Siete mesas de billar franc�s' and, in the end, also not the well-chosen film ` lot girasoles ciegos'. 
For this film Garci expects no honorings. 
` At the beginning you believe that you work for the progeny, later you notice that it is only for prospering, and now you are contented if one has produced one more film ', explains Garci after more than 30 years of occupation.
