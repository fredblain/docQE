The connections between policy and ' Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
" The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli. 
The accusations of the bar of the anti-mafia-authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of municipality Gioia Tauro which were arrested this morning because of involvement in mafia shops are serious. 
In handcuffs was also taken Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public management, as well as his nephew: the lawyer who carries the same name like the boss of the clan had been already condemned because of involvement in criminal unions of the mafia, at that time to an amount of damages of 10 million euros. 
" Every kind of moral and juridical norm ignoring ", so write the lawyers, " had decided both local management, which to pay lawyer Piromalli money for consultation operations. " 
" Therefore it had been made the mafia group possible? so the judges? to penetrate on official way into the city halls and to have an influence on the policy of the public management. " 
The president of the regional committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not say no that it is in his region " anything but an exception to bump into connections of local management and the organized crime. " " There are places in which the concentration of the mafia is bigger than in others in which such connections are inevitable practically. 
But there is also local politician who resist the pressure of the ' Ndrangheta: The heroes who keep a white vest. " 
The arrests from this morning follow those from the last July with which according to the police the clan Piromalli was beheaded. 
Since end of the last April the district council had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro, however, already in 1991? and also at that time on account of supposed connections between organized crime and the local management? if the local politicians of her local authorities had been relieved. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, at that time mayor of the Udc, has been chosen after the ballot from May, 2006 the head of the center right coalition. 
He shouted the resolution to scandal as the prefecture of the district council arranged. 
He prosecuted on it in vice Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti to whom he accused to have invented everything for political-strategical reasons. However, the judges explain in connection with the arrest warrant from this morning that the Piromalli clan had even dared to apply for a change of the A3 project. 
From a listening action in connection with the investigations to the case Dal Torrione, the readiness has appeared to meet the wishes of an enterpriser who is as is known a representative of the big group around the Piromalli by which the measures of the public management became identically with the interests of this clan.
