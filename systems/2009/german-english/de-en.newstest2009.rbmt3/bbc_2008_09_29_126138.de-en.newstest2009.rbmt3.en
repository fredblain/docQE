The government made available 14 billion pounds to protect the inserts of Bradford and Bingleys 2.6 million customers. 
The interest for this advance is paid by all enterprises which get money of investors, including 59 building companies 
The general manager of the union of the house building societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said, it is "intolerable" that the societies and her members would have to pay. 
At last the 14 billion advances will be paid back if Bradford and Bingleys loans are erased. 
But the interest accumulated in the interim is credited every year to those 700 finance enterprises which accept payments. 
The program to the compensation of finance services confirmed compared with the BBC that 59 house building societies are included in this number.

The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest is amounted themselves for the loan to 450 million pounds in 2009. 
That is the fact that the societies must procure 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year.
