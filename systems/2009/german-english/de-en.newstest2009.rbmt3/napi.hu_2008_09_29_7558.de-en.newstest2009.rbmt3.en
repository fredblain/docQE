A name for the sin-expensive child 
Now the written version of the 700Mrd dollar of heavy rescue parcel-law is which shall be applied in several stages and is aimed at the buying of the bad loans of the banks. 
In the first passageway half of the money should be given. 
By a meeting which came to an end on Saturday after midnight local time east coast the congressional representatives have brought after debates of several days to an arrangement on the 700-billion dollar of heavy rescue parcel, announced Reuters. 
" We have achieved essential progress ", said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the American chamber of deputies, and meant, one must only write down the arrangement. 
Both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain supported the achieved compromise about the rescue parcel. 
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson meant about the result: The program will show effect and it becomes efficient, however, one must act even more. Here according to Pelosi it would be not about the rescue the embankment Street, but therefore, the oar of the economy rumzureiï¿½en. 
The written version of the parcel was still published before the opening of the Asian markets, thus, Washington time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), however, has released no high-altitude flight on the stock exchanges. 
On Monday the chamber of deputies about the law draft votes first to the stabilization of the economy of 2008, then the senate is in the row. 
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday evening with Pelosi, and also the White House greeted the news about the arrangement. 
We are contented with the at night achieved progress and estimate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House. 
However, the program deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush's administration after which the 700 Bn. dollars should be spent all at once on the buying more decayed, with loans of loaded securities. 
In the first Tranche half of the 700-billion amount should be given at most and 250 Bn. are available immediately, after the congress will vote as expected on Monday about the Causa. This sum should be used for the buying of loan-loaded, bad securities, and the president should decide on the other 100 Bn. USD. 
The program is checked by own committee to which also the president of the Federal reserve belongs. 
Other half of the 700 Bn. depends on an other decision of the congress. 
For the purposes of the law the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactics: It can do at the same time bad loans, mortgages, and with mortgages loaded securities buy, or also other "toxic" loans. 
As responsible persons of the ministry reported, the buying can occur in an auction, as well as directly. 
The law enables to the affected companies to take part in an insurance program with which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the alarming means, and which pay enterprise to the damages to be expected suitable fees. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means in such a way that can be made available up to 700 Bn. dollars as an emergency relief for the American financial system, it is for the largely invested buying of bad means, her assurance, or the avoidance of a system risk which is released by the collapse of a bigger financial institution. 
We put the necessary steps, so that we are ready for the introduction of the law, as soon as it was signed, according to Paulson. 
However, the bosses in difficulties advisable and now on state help to instructed banks can calculate on the fact that her dispatches which are called in the oversea slang casually " Golden Handshake " are shortened by the government. 
There will be a shortening of the salaries only in certain cases, and these shortenings will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps out in each case. 
The shortening means in the essentials that if the ministry buys within the scope of an auction, thus the " Golden Handshake " is taxed, is pushed away unless, the retired bank boss in the pension. 
In case of a direct buying of the decayed loans the government will intervene aggressively to make sure that the manager's salaries are not exaggerated. 
To the picture also belongs that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions refer only to new arrangements, so that the more people take part in the program. 
This is the first case in the American history that shortenings are regulated on manager's salaries by law, commented democrat Barney Frank, chairperson of the finance committee, the measure. 
The state wins participation rights in the participant banks, so that the risk sinks for the taxpayers, because they can also take part, as soon as to the economy and with it also the saved bank is better again. 
The law draft intends that the president must present to the congress during the next five years a suggestion as the taxpayers should get back her lost money from the finance sector again. 
However, there was on both sides sceptic which have expressed her doubts in relation on the plan. 
This is not that what the American citizens expect from us, the plan on no account protects the money of the taxpayers, according to the California Republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur meant: The measures were sped up by the same persons who are also responsible for the collapse the embankment Street.
