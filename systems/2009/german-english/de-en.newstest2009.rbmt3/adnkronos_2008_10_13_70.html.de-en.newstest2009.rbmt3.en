Brunetta: " From now it is had breakfast before the work " 
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are swivelling doors for the entrances and exits of the officials. 
From today the measure will come into force against them those smart alecks who only stamp and go then during the working hours coffee drinking. 
The new one? Today anti-slacker's law " was introduced by Renato Brunetta, the minister for public management and by Mauro Masi, secretary general of the presidium of the council of ministers. 
" 
" Now a new era of the responsibility and transparence begins. 
This is Reformismus ", underlines Brunetta once again. 
The installation ends with the Palazzo Chigi in all constructions of the presidium of the council of ministers. 
Masi means moreover: " the choice of the swivelling doors is also from big symbolically value ". 
From sides of the officials there was no opposition, assured the secretary general: " This process was supported by all, the collaboration came from all sides ". 
Now, all in all, there is no breakfast during the working hours more; end with Kaffe or croissant. 
Brunettas advises with respect to that with a smile: " A good cappuccino works at 7 o'clock miracle ". 
During a conference of the upper committee of the public management (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione) 
from Rome the minister announces that " within three months the absences of the officials have decreased to 50%, that is 60,000 persons per year are present more at the work ". 
He adds, it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public management of Italy 
" their Lohn-Dynamiken - according to the minister - were big during the last 8-10 years twice as as the private area and well over the inflation rate ". 
In the meantime, thousands of officials have got together to work against the Brunetta decree within the scope of the appeal supported by Codacons. 
" While the minister for the civil service distinguishes himself with figures about lower Absenzen at the work - the consumer's headquarters write - the people of the ' active slackers ' grow incessantly. 
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the civil service have got together to explain the war to the illegal norms of the decree. " 
In particular it is fought before the regional administrative court (TAR) for additional financial balances for working-conditioned illness; thus also become the planned extension of the obliging house arrest of the ill working-class taker during which controlling visits can be made and other aspects of the innovations of the minister contested.
