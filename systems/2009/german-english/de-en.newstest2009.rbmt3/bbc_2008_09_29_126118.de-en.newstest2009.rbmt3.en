Fears around the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan 
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan nearly 200,000 children have not been inoculated on account of the power which is associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations. 
The United Nations have carried out the last week in six provinces a vaccination program. 
However, they could not reach children in parts from Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons. 
According to a speaker of UN this was the case in spite of the promise of the Taliban not to attack the thousands the vaccinations carrying out employee or to hinder.
