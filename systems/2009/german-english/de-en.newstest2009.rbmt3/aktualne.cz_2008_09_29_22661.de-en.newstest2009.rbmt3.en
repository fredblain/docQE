If you do not think - then pays! 
An emotion-loaded campaign is directed at driver 
The most expensive action to the security on the streets in the Czech history. 
Also so the emotion-loaded media campaign which wants to begin the traffic ministry on Wednesday can be characterized. 
The authority of minister Ale?? eb�? ek makes a slip to dissuade driver from dangerous behavior behind the steering wheel. 
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on the radio, in the cinema, on the Internet, but also on Flyern. 
She should dissuade the drivers from too quick driving manner and alcohol at the wheel. 
And they also remember it, before journey beginning anzugurten. 
The campaign wants to talk above all to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least also occupational motorists in the conscience. 
And what is shown in the advertisements? 
Above all the stories of people which appeal to emotions. 
Of it the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also testifies: 
If you do not think - then pays! 
The words " do not think " stand in capital letters on a sign sign. 
And then in a blood puddle there stands the word "pays". 
This should mean that one can pay inattentiveness with own life a moment. 
The advertisements will "shock" the spectators till 2010. 
The ministry can be inspired by similar campaigns in the anglo-saxon lands where one can see quite normally pictures with drastic admissions of accident victims. 
It makes a slip of the fact that thus the accident figures and the number of the road casualty on the Czech streets sink. 
The advertisements were put together by the agency Euro of RSCG. 
Sugar bread and whip for the drivers 
" The motto sugar bread and whip counts to the drivers. 
Sugar bread means that they if they go, for instance, with Red save time. 
Then the whip is the threat of a punishment or an accident. 
The driver must be reminded of the risk ", according to the traffic psychologist of the hospital Well Homolce Martin Ko? �n. 
And, therefore, campaigns of information are necessary in the press and above all negative advertisement, thinks the psychologist. 
Already less actually are of his opinion after boards which draw the attention of the drivers to a danger. 
" Does one put up a static board which warns about a danger, will this soon probably pass with the surroundings, and the drivers will perceive them no more ", thinks Ko? �n.
