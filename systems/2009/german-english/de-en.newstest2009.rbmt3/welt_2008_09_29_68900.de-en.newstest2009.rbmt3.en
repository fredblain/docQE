Dark matter influences flight from space probes 
For many years a mysterious phenomenon provides with brisk for desperation: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing by manoeuvres. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einsteins could not be quite right. 
Nearly 18 years the space probe "Ulysses" flew by the space. 
Now because of soon freezing fuel pipelines the cold's death threatens her. 
Among scientists a mysterious phenomenon provides for many years for confusion - the swing by anomaly. 
The Swing-by is received a flight manoeuvre from space probes, with the swing additional them in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, possibly of the earth. 
The probes can thereby save a lot of fuel. 
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick just as the solar probe Ulysses. 
What surprises the researchers, besides, however, already for many years: The missiles do not behave 100-percent in such a way as one would expect it after the venerable law of gravitation. 
Rather it comes to irregularities in the speed. 
The probes become unexpectedly quick or slower. 
Up to now the physicists could not explain this effect. 
They christened him swing by anomaly. 
Some experts fear that possibly even the general theory of relativity Albert Einsteins which describes the attraction of matter by a bend of the space could not be quite right. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still believes firmly in the fact that Einstein did not wander, and tries to explain the swing by anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter, the astronomers in the universe have put out. 
" Responsibly for the anomaly dark matter could be which could also be completely near the earth ", he writes. 
The space researchers know about the existence of the dark matter only for about ten years. 
An attraction whose effect on other heavenly bodies can be observed goes out from her obviously. 
However, she herself is absolutely invisible, that is she sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, in particular just also no visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists the dark matter well puts out one fifth of the whole mass of the universe, at least.
