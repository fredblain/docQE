Milk becomes five pence per liter more expensive 
The people on Jersey feel confronted to have to pay more for her milk. 
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the majority market price of his milk to other five pence per liter from Monday. 
It is the second rise in prices this year, after two pence rise in February, and comes, after investigations of a consulting firm were carried out. 
The retail dealers should decide themselves whether they liked to transmit the price increase to her customers. 
Last before the price increase in February the majority market price of Jersey milk changed in 2002.
