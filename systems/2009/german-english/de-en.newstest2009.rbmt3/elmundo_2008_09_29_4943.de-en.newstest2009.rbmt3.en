Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
On ` Emerging Technology Conference ', organizes from WITH, has introduced to Microsoft the progress of the new picture recognition system and the human interaction, a being of the artificial intelligence without a lot of intelligence which is able, nevertheless to do some primitive tasks as for example a taxi order (or in the case of Microsoft that is a route planner to move on the campus of the enterprise). The system follows what hears it during the entertainment. 
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this 'Rezeptionistin' can recognize how many persons are in the space who they are and remember even how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of her entertainment. 
It can also arrange the persons present according to the conversations in the groups. 
In the presentation video ` the Rezeptionistin' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not accompanying to the group which leads with her conversation, and that also no company employee is. 
She asks whether the person wants to visit here somebody and answers that she soon listens. 
Everything without blue Screenshot 
Impressively 
This is absolutely the future. 
Now the enterprise has the better things upon which it can concentrate, for example, on the next version of her operating system Windows. 
This week one spoke very superficially about the strategy change of Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be quicker and not have many integrated programs so. 
Steve Ballmer found out that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would function 5 times faster. Person, Steven, this will be only for to few. 
Everything is only one statement if one thinks that Microsoft in Windows added to versions an one or other function and ` Extras'. 
The change of course is worthwhile 
Microsoft is right, the operating system loses bit by bit to meaning, exactly like the software. 
When Google chrome appeared in the net, was a part of the theory that it is the first step of Google to compete with Windows. 
Cleverly many pointed out to the fact that the browser is no operating system. 
The operating system, as an inalienable part, will be always necessary, so that hardware and software can function at the same time. 
The operating system fulfils the function which can be compared to the function of his wife or his husband if it is a matter of informing of something his mother-in-law. 
That's right. 
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth. 
What said Ballmer this week, is the confirmation of this idea. 
The people give every time less attention to the operating system, for it more to the web browser. 
The computer is only begun to explain the Firefox, the Explorer or chrome and we spend every day more time in surfing, than in the surroundings of the 'windows'. 
For which does half serve in the computer of available applications? 
Less is more 
And Windows 7 must go more compactly, much is more compact than Vista. 
Lighter, did not exaggerate in such a way, less complex. 
The interest of Microsoft consists more in integrating his on-line services which can become then, in the end, the alternative to Google. 
In the reality they need this, without doubt. I bring a small example of it. 
I have the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreational rooms for Microsoft employee at the beginning of the month done. 
On the soft drink machine a sign is fastened: ` Your search. Our future '. It prints out a request to use own tools for on-line search. 
In 2006 an independent study came in the end that used 66% of the employees in Microsoft, Google for the searches in the net. 
By the way, the last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows mobile 7 has got in the delay. 
She will appear not beginning, but in the end of 2009, rather even in 2010. 
Microsoft searches the possibility to bring mobile 7 at the same time on the mark to Windows 7 and Windows. 
Every day the phone changes into a computer. 
The Android and iPhon are already at the market, but the other delay will cost money.
