Carmen T�rtola Valencia: her father was a Catalan (Floren� T�rtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), it is born in the quarter Triana and when she was three years old, her family has moved to London. 
She was a dancer and expert for oriental dances. 
She had a being tight life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and sat down for the abolition of the corset which limited the free female movement. 
The life of this woman, they her tracks with the dance and aesthetics revolution in Europe in the time between the wars leave has, fascinated Isabel Bay�n. 
` I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she has suggested this role to me what seemed to me impossible. ' 
` We do not try to tell about her life to preserve sonder her esprit, ' said the flamenco dancer. 
Their dance bases have helped me in flamenco a lot. 
` The dance of the Schmetterlings' seemed to me, for instance, like Guajira, or ` the dance of the queue ' how tango. 
Their dancing was sensuous and to me has been said that my dancing also lies in this aesthetic area ', she states. 
The staging counts on two unusual cooperating: with Miguel Poveda who will sing once more for Isabel by one of her images, as he has done it also in ` La puerta abierta '; and with flamenco master craftswoman Matilde Coral who wanted to work exceptionally together with one of her ex-pupils. 
` Matilde plays T�rtola, a very ripe personality. 
I am happy because she agreed to help in my work, and I feel very much honored. ' 
The staging also counts on musical composition and the Gitaristen Jes�s Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor�n; with the Percussion of El P�jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el viola and the collaboration with actor Juanfra J�arez, he ` takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were divas with whom he falls in love over and over again. ' 
In this work one also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman who became known in places situated so far like India, to the United States or Russia and, in addition, in whole Europe, although she has ordinarily lived in London. 
` I wanted to recall them to recollection, because I think, she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain epoch and whose works today nobody more knows how to estimate and they, so, still less ', states Bay�n. 
Today the image takes place around 20:30 in the theater Lope de Vega.
