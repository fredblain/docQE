The Sudeten demanded of the USA a popular vote 
The Sudeten-German had requested in 1945 of the affiliation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States. 
This arises from a letter which stores scientific library in the collections of the S�db�hmischen. 
If we cannot be a component of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the patronage of the United States on America. 
With such a wish some groups of Sudeten-German should have turned in 1945 to the US-president. 
Among the rest, this arises from a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and which is kept today in the collections of the S�db�hmischen scientific library. 
The Germans of Krumau ask the American president in the letter, he should permit the return of the "Sudeten region" - on the base of the Munich agreement was taken by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia not. 
" We have properly understood the situation and really want to be sure of the words that the American unities enter German territory not as an Unterdr�cker and enemies, but as a liberator ", one says in a letter which lies with the words " people which the destiny of the Sudeten in hug " is signed. 
Because the connection with Czechoslovakia allows to suppose the Sudeten-German - in knowledge of the Czech national character - that they expected brutality, recklessness, lack of understanding, suppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate over the Bohemian Forest for today and for ever. 
" We cannot believe that you award without taking into consideration the view of a quarter million inhabitants this area a state foreign for us which has suppressed minorities and tries to remove and has contributed purely nothing at all to the victory of the allies ", is to be read in the letter. 
The reason for it, which is why the authors cannot sign, is supposedly the fear of Rachegel�sten of the " Czech Unterdr�cker ". 
If US-president Zweifel looks after in the disposition of the Bohemian Forest-German, it is enough if he initiated a popular vote about in the Bohemian Forest region whether the inhabitants become a part of the USA or wanted to live under the protectorate of the United States. 
Although the text of the letter may sound a little bit naive in today's knowledge of the post-war history, nevertheless, he draws according to opinion of some contemporary witnesses a good picture concerning the expectations at that time of the Sudeten-German. 
Even if the b�hmischen Germans at least had to anticipate that one would negotiate about her deportation from the republic, confessed to himself only few of them such a possibility generally one. 
Some waited that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten. 
Again others believed, they could simply remain in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa who comes from Budweis also confirms them. 
He was used in the war as Budweiser German with the navy on the Baltic Sea. 
When he came at the end of the war to British captivity and one brought him in a prisoner's of war camp to Holstein, dozens other b�hmische Germans came to him, he should teach them Czech. 
" You believed if they came home, the Czech would come to them to fits ", according to Chalupa. 
Nobody to the German prisoner of war who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia calculated to his opinion after on the fact, that one him on the basis of the Bene? decrees from the republic would expel.
