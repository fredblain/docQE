In Mexico and without ` peep-toes' 
With British punctuality, at 17:40 o'clock, in the time which was planned by the program beside the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Ju�rez de M�xico DF landed the airplane of the Spanish air force by which princess and prince of Asturias traveled. 
The sun went under it, but her rays have still made use the hand as a sunshade to see the royal pair which got out of the airplane. 
Directly in the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities 
Before it I had asked a pair of hours a taxi driver on the street whether he knew that of the princess and prince of Asturias visited the town to formalize the official trip. 
- Ah, very well, thus, there one can do at the airport in this time no people mitnehmen�Sie is from hier�oder thus � 
No, she is the Spaniard, but she has lived a pair of years here. 
-Ach in such a way, very well � 
But the Mexican press knows certainly who to the princess and prince of Asturias are and know the importance of the trip. 
These are many which wait in the hangar of the airport and in the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the navy who deliver salute. 
The prince seems smiling, dresses in navy blue, and it, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without usual ` peep-toes', was maybe informed of her that it is expected a thunderstorm in DF. 
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official suite waits. 
In the door of the hotel at which they are accommodated, one four biggest in the town, a reporter of the Mexican television who does with pleasure jokes waits for them.
