Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in the exchange for peace 
The chairperson of temporary Israeli government Ehud Olmert has expressed himself for the return practically of all areas which were taken in 1967, thus also the Jordan land, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights if one can close for it peace with Palestine and Syria in the exchange. 
He stressed this in an interview which was printed on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot. 
" We must reach to an arrangement with the Palestinians what means that it becomes necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas if not even everything ", said Olmert compared with the newspaper. 
" We keep a certain percentage of these areas, however, we will have to resign a similarly high percentage (Israeli area) to the Palestinians because there will be no peace without this ", he added. 
He put away that a possible return will also enclose East Jerusalem. 
" That, the security in Jerusalem wants and does not want above all that tractors or bulldozers roll over his legs as it has happened to one of my best friends, will have to renounce a part of Jerusalem ", noted Olmert in allusion on two attacks in the town in July in which several people were killed and dozens persons were injured. 
According to words of the premier it will be necessary to find a " special solution for the Tempelbern and holy and historical places " which lie on the territory of the Old Town. 
" That which wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty about the whole town will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs. 
This will not function ", he further confirmed. 
Deduction of the Golan heights 
Olmert expressed itself for a deduction of Israel of the Golan heights what is to his view after an inalienable condition on the end of a peace treaty with Syria. 
However, this would also require certain strains on the part of from Damascus. 
" My suggestion is not to make peace with Syria solely on the base of a deduction of the Golan heights ", confirmed Olmert. 
" The Syrians know only much too well what they must renounce, to get back the Golan heights. 
They will have to renounce her present respect with Iran; they will have to renounce her respect with the (Shiite) Hizbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support, they grant to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terror network Al-Khaida and the jihad (Holy War) in Iraq ", concretized the prime minister.
