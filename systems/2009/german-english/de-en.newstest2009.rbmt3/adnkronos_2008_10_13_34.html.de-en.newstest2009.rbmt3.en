Napolitano: " Prevention against working accidents is vital " 
Every day 2500 working accidents happen in Italy, three persons die and 27 invalids remain in perpetuity. 
For 2007 the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm since that the deadly working accidents lay with approximately 1200. 
These figures cover seriousness of a phenomenon which causes almost twice as many deaths as by murders originate. 
Today the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will commit 58. national days for the victims of working accidents to steer thus the attention of the social institutions and media on this dramatic situation. 
" The alarming data widespread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm as determining the question of the prevention in the workplace is. ", the president of the republic Giorgio Napolitano confirms Pietro Mercandelli in his communication of the president of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro). 
The head of state expresses his " big esteem for the steady engagement to the prevention in the workplaces, for the protection of the injured workers, to the social security for the families of the victims and to the sensitization of the public opinion ". 
" An indignant "Basta" has rose here; understandably with the tragedies which, measured in her scale, some whirl in the media and condolence of the general public release. However, the everyday reality confronts us often with dramatic events which can even recur in her own dynamism ". 
Napolitano does not hide that " there is anyway also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information. " 
The numerous initiatives accept a special meaning for a straighter realization in school frame on the part of the youngsters who feed themselves to the professional life. 
It is our duty to direct the attention upon this phenomenon and not to change the subject from his social seriousness. One must bring into force a legislative norm and improve. 
On his part the president of the chamber Gianfranco Fini emphatically " how the phenomenon of the working-conditioned deaths has an urgent social emergency forms which offends the conscience of us to all and makes all institutions work towards determined rules which have the purpose to put an end " to the problem. 
" The data of the working accidents seem to signal a light improvement, however, this does not exclude that the number of the working-conditioned deaths is too high ", stresses president of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli. 
" We might not that this " positive trend " signifies less attention. Exactly this causes the tragedy at the end. " 
" As believe that one undertakes in reason not enough to walk towards the phenomenon of the accidents. One can fight by different actions against it. 
Stronger controls and inspections are necessary according to our opinion? so Mercandelli; but also the stronger measures to the clarification of the workers which begin already at school ". 
" An other strain is necessary - he subjoins - what concerns the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion. 
But above all a bigger sense of responsibility is asked by sides of the employers compared with a phenomenon which shows a social emergency ". 
Mercandelli also depended on it on the " progressive deterioration of the protection for the working accident victims " on speaking and prangerte the " abolition of the social system against which we fight during the last years ". 
" Consequently the purpose is to return a guarantee on assurance to the working-class taker, so that the destiny of the victim of a working accident does not become dependent on the voluntary or accidental donations which are decided by time at the moment from a legislator ".
