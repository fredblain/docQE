Abuse of the stepfather " led to the suicide " 
The many years' abuse by her stepfather has led to the fact that a woman has killed herself, it was reported to a court. 
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received an imprisonment from six years, after he had stood eight cases of sexual abuse. 
The penal court of law in Truro found out that he his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle tied up regularly as them between five and seven years as was. 
Trerise wrote in a confession: " I feel responsibly for her death. " 
The court found out that Mrs. Randle killed herself in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on the 1st April, 2007 at the age of 34. 
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had tied up them and had connected her eyes before he sexual actions carried out, while her mother was away around by a restaurant to work. 
Trerise and his woman separated in the 1980th and he moved back to Cornwall. 
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth. 
Nevertheless, the court found out that Mrs. Randle who worked a big part of her time in an honorary capacity for the Nationwide trust was pursued by the abuse which had been added her two times per week. 
Public prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said, that Mrs. Randle who had been a keen surfer and cyclist, has been since 2006 " emotionally deadly " and would have " her life given up " 
In April, 2007 her right father Terrance Randle found them deadly in her apartment in Plymouth. 
One supposes that she has killed herself while itself herself by means of a plastic bag has suffocated. 
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter who wrote a confession letter which ended so: " I was in habit to tie up them and to connect her eyes. " 
" I have not urged them sexually. 
I feel responsible for her death. " 
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: " You are an extremely strange Fetischist and for her victim it must have been horrific, in particular because she was only seven. 
This joyless history ends with the suicide of the victim. 
Still the fact is more badly that it is very unlikely that the affair would be ended in court if she had not done this. " 
He added: " I take which consequences to the knowledge, according to description of Stephanies father and mother, her action about the years on her daughter had. 
She would have been otherwise unambiguously a promising, successful and happy young woman. "
