Letters - a dishonored land 
It was Mr. Vic Toews, Ex-'Justiz of ' ministers (what an irony) in the cabinet Harper which allowed itself the last summer to say about Louise Arbour, it is a 'disgrace' for Canada. 
This woman whom do not end wishing fight for the justice has led and earns all our admiration to cover thus with disgrace, states just as much about the persons round the prime minister, how about Stephen Parker himself. 
We have to do it here with a government which has got theirs in the concentration camp Guantanamo caught compatriot not as only from all affected lands home. 
A government which not even takes into consideration that Omar Khadr was one more youngster when the things happened which are accused of him. 
The only government which breaks in spite of the fact that Canada has signed the Genevan convention, her word and allows to vegetate away a child soldier under inhuman conditions. 
The only one which lets itself down to a justice parody to estimate the guilt of the defendant. 
If we call ourselves in recollection that above all UNICEF, amnesty plead Internationally and the union of the Canadian lawyers to get home Omar Khadr, so that he gets a fair process in Canada. 
Exactly this government also closes the eyes before the torture: It interests them a little that a young adult will have broken after so many years of the torture absolutely for good emotionally. 
We are not aware of that yet, but we experience here just a perfidious curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word which carries Harper constantly like a flag before itself, and mouth from his sounds so inexpressive. 
There has come the time in which there is no more morality: One may ill-treat a Canadian citizen arbitrarily, torment and lock up, completely to Gutdï¿½nken of a head of the government who is supported till this day only by the minority (he may belong after the 14th October completely to the minority ...). 
Many voters believe to find her welfare at a party which preaches virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has renounced from him what put out the call and the dignity of our land. 
The disgrace, Mr. Toews, lies in this Lossagung, and nowhere differently.
