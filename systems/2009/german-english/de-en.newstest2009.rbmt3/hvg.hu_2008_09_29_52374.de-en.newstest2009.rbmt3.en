The psychology of the ï¿½berbietens - or why we are ready to pay more 
With auctions the buyers incline to be economical more and to overrate the offered for sale therefore. 
Now neurologist and economic researchers of the university of New York has succeeded it in discovering the neuro-logically-economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior. 
According to one in the "Science" magazine Published study the people want to be not hit in a competition, as for example of an auction on eBay, and are ready, therefore to pay even banked prices. 
The researchers have tried to explore the neuro-logical pattern of this "play" with experimental auctions. 
A group of the volunteers should play lotto, while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the test persons were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). 
With both plays the participants could win money, indeed, a raised activity of the Striatum, a complex was measured below the cerebral cortex, with losers of the auction at which outbidding the opponent plays an essential role. 
Beside many other functions this brain region is responsible for the "selfreward" of the nervous system. 
Hence, the researchers meant, the price increase can be explained by the avoidance of an over-reaction of the Striatums. 
To underpin her thesis, the small farmers have done investigations to the postpursuit of the money in the research group, in addition. 
In this case three groups should cooffer against a partner under different conditions. 
The true value of the product was informed of the control group, then they have done her applications. 
In addition, 15 dollars of reward were promised to another group, for the case that they arise as a winner from the play. 
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction which were likewise lost in case of a lost play. 
The difference between both groups merely consisted in the fact, that the stress with one on the profit, while lay with the others on the losing. 
However, as a proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists the members were ready " against the losing " playing group for higher applications, than that in Controlling one or the "Gewinn" group. 
" These results can be derived from no earlier economic theory. 
These have since the behaviour patterns observed at auctions up to now only with the joy at the profits, or the risk avoidance reasonably. 
The contradiction between these both theories was dissolved thanks to the picture-giving neuro-logical procedures, so that we have now the third explanation ready " - Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic faculty of the university of New York meant.
