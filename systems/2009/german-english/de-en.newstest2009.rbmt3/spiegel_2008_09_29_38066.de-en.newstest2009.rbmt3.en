Uefa president Platini: Reprieve for Poland and the Ukraine 
Acting prime minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations were soon put under the direct responsibility by president and prime minister. 
" The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as a trust proof in the Ukraine and her ability to organize the EM together with Poland ", said Wasjunik. 
" However, this is no Amnestie for our land. 
The work has begun scarcely and there is in both lands still a lot to act. " 
In the schedule for the construction or rebuilding of the stages, streets, hotel and airports both hosts limp behind. 
Even the number of the EM stages from eight to six is possibly reduced. 
" We can waste no more time. 
Now we must work with maximum speed ", said Ukrainian federation president Grigorij Surkis. 
" UEFA will keep an eye on us consistently. " 
An even more radical step was decided in Poland. 
The guidance of Polish federation PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals from the national Olympic committee and has been substituted with the independent governor Robert Zawlocki. 
The committee had gathered on inquiry of sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
There is " the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act under the rules ", said Drzewiecki of Polish news agency PAP. 
" We have assured of Uefa president Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation does not suffer for the EM 2012 from it. " 
Several Erstligisten had been condemned only in the past season because of manipulation to the compulsive descent, at short notice, in the end, even the league start had to be shifted.
