The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, in a town of the quite special kind 
Hidden between the outgrowths of the leisure parks in the vicinity of Orlando, few miles away from the glittering, loud and huge activity, there lies a quiet town in which the pride and the complications of the Afro American culture appear. 
Eatonville, the first totally black town in the land and the hometown Zora Neale Hurstons, is as easy no more to describe as Hurston it in 1935 did: " the town with 5 lakes, three Krocketpl�tzen, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison. " 
Nowadays it is a pilgrim's site. 
Alice Walker, tones Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! To think festival in Eatonville come around the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And still is and does remain the town which she describes? and she did a tourist destination, while it took up them in Florida guide who was produced at the times of the depression by the federal author project? in many respects a place of the quite special kind. 
Eatonville is so independent, good-quality and private like in the 1930th when Hurston wrote that rural black municipalities in Florida often refused to divide her true thoughts with the white man who knows " so little about us that he does not know what to him escapes. " 
Even nowadays, in one year in him a black Pr�sidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, for an open conversation about race relations appeals, these are many here furthermore suffer from being observed by outsiders. 
" We are anxious very much of it like our history is told ", according to Hortense Jones, 59, from birth an inhabitant of the town and parishioner of the oldest church of the town. 
It must be right. " 
Eatonville was defined for a long time as a paradox of the triumph and the fight. 
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a municipality of nearly 2,400 inhabitants in whom the poverty rate is high twice as like the land average. 
It is on the one hand a stronghold of the literature and, on the other hand, an example him - sometimes convicted, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south which has her roots in the American slavery. 
It is not astonishing that inhabitants are here proudly as well as on the hat. 
And so properly the doubts began around Eatonville's image, actually, with Zora as here all Hurston call. 
She introduced to the world her hometown in books which came sincerely and were written in dialect, as well as " Mules and Men " (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) 
Five sales in the Florida guide changed the town which lies quite near of the route 77, a street through the often-forgotten center of Florida leads, to the scenes of black history and human drama. 
Cheeky like Oskar in the real life as well as in the literature, Hurston reader led to the store of Eatonvilles to the first mayor, then Joe Clarke, and turned to more private affairs. 
" Off the street to the lefts ", she wrote, " is the brown white lacquered modern school, with her cultivated gardens and playgrounds after which always Howard Miller looks, although he can barely read and write. " 
She also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn " drinks of every kind sold and was auch immer to hourly rooms fits. " 
In only few hundred words Hurston associated Eatonville with selfgovernment, but also with illiteracy, the second marriage and sex. 
This was definitely no guide. 
Indeed, this was not a portrait which was estimated by all. 
" Zora described the things in such a way as they were ", according to the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls the Hurston perpetuated, while she quoted the men who sang songs about them her beauty which were more fully of sexual allusions. 
She added: " Some people did not like this. " 
One remembers here still Hurtson as a lively eccentric who returned regularly, after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that if Hurston came to the town showered, she did this mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and with trousers dresses, in a town even today itself something imagines on her venerable clothes style. 
According to Mr. Franklin most inhabitants were fascinated, while many they despised. 
" The people were to be seen always gladly Zora ", said Mr Franklin. 
But " she never remained too long ", he added there during him in his chair swung, on a terrace situated to the back which looks at the Sabelia lake in which Hurston was christened most probably. 
As a Hurston in 1960 died it was poor and her books were made a mistake. 
Together with the large part of the world Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them. 
Although she was once a famous author, a Zeitgen�ssin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman in the Barnard college in the 1920th, became they in fort Pierce, Florida where she lived, buried in an anonymous grave. 
In Eatonville there was no big commemorative celebration, no public readings in the big style. 
" I do not think that they have understood her contribution in the world or her inheritance in the least ", according to Valerie Boyd, author of " Wrapped in Rainbows ", a biography about Hurston it was published in 2003. 
The turn came in the 80s. 
Orange county authorities wanted to lay a f�nfspurige highway through the town to substitute for the Kennedy boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the municipality. 
Orlandos suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 by the western outskirts. 
The suggestion was presented when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history. 
Compulsive integration, among the rest, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the municipality. 
In the 50s the fight against mixing of different races brought hatred in the community. 
" In this time often came a heap of white boys and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting apart ", said Mr. Franklin. 
" There was even once a woman besides was killed. 
They threw a water melon from the car. " 
In 1955 Hurston questioned in a writing to the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the uppermost court of law to force integration, while she called his decision in the case Brown against the school council as " insulting instead of my race respecting ". 
Nowadays inhabitants say that although the abolition of the racial segregation was positive in some regard, she weakened them the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of his youngsters. 
" Black children were accustomed it to be embraced - I remember this - one embraced his teacher in the morning and one embraced his teacher in the evening ", according to N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing manager of the charitable group for the protection of the Eatonville community. 
This could be maintained so long, she added, to teachers and pupils came no more from the same place. 
" One did not embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there a cultural gap exists ", said Mrs. Nathiri. 
However, the civil rights have contributed to the fact that place was created for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who ignored prejudices, as well as she did it, with positive self-confidence and statements such as " How somebody can refuse to go along the joy of my society! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975 the author Alice Walker on the way did anonymous grave to herself Hurstons and started to fight for the revival of her fame. 
Five years later a much promised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was to be found in the book shelves, and did them once more a part of the American literature canon. 
The major road project came exactly at a time, in the Eatonvilles the most famous daughter once again in the light of the general public stood. 
And Hurstons old neighbors them saw this time as a rescuer. 
The municipality began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festivals to point what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration. 
Some years later the district of his road construction plans turned away. 
" The plans of a f�nfspurigen major road animated the town, accelerated the whole at top speed, woke up real civil pride ", said Mrs. Nathiri. 
Mrs. Boyd a little more simply expressed it: " Zora saved Eatonville. " 
The victory against the major road project has contributed to a change of the self-image of the town. 
There came more and more incomer, as well as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who goes since 1993 here to the church, and locals started to estimate the past anew. 
Eatonville was taken up in 1998 in the national historical register. 
A new one-story library (of course to Hurston named) opened in 2006 on the new-paved and improved in appearance Kennedy boulevard. 
Nowadays Eatonville is still a specific feature in Florida: only 6 miles of the city center Orlandos she can sometimes feel like a lane Hinter in the summer rain, as small as at that time as them was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880th. 
(Nowadays she is black to 90%.) 
Outsiders in search of the history Eatonvilles and his meaning are often still treated with care. 
An approval is necessary for most interviews in the approach and certain things - as well as the wall painting of Eatonvilles of the oldest church which was painted by a white and shows black men at the field work - may not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a predilection for Dark red, still fear that her guarded community is misunderstood. 
And still, at the same time to the Hurston festival bigger became, a raised degree was also born in home pride. 
Above all young people incline as to see Eatonville as Hurston her whole race saw: wonderfully, mixes with all his problems, neither worse even better and as proudly, creatively and diligently, stupidly and like any other race group and people's group in America. 
It is the frank love to this town one in the voice of Mr. Franklin nephews can hear, to 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, that plans after the college to return to Eatonville to work in the city administration or at the police which could use some help according to him. 
And even the younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from winter park, have learned to describe Eatonville properly. 
" Most people who drive through only here will think: " Oh this town is nothing in comparison to all the others ", said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after the church. 
" But if one really stops and looks a moment long at his history, it is a very nice town. "
