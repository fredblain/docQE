Economic Nobel prize goes to Paul Krugman 
The economic Nobel prize is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of commercial patterns and the settlement of economic activities. 
The 55 years old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer which teaches at the university of Princeton and famously for his regular articles for New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the economic policy and foreign affairs of the Bush's administration. 
Few months after the posters from the 11th September, 2001, during the days of the Enron breakdown, Krugman had stated in an editorial New York Times, this second event has been more vital for the history of the USA than the attempts. 
A prediction which received a lot of polemic as an answer and was reproached with the small farmer still years later today, however, absolutely right turns out. 
" I am surprised and also shocks at how fast the recollection of the scandals have disappeared within the scope of the breakdowns of Enron or Worldcom from the public field of vision ", explained Krugman in the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the executive committee of the European central bank Krugman is a " small farmer of big value ", however, also a Banalisierer with a " very aggressive style which is directed especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush's government. "
