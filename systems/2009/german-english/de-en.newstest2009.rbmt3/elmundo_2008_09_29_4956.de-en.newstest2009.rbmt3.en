Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you are a very many-sided woman, right? 
I believe, but, in the end, everything meets in one and these areas many common characteristics have. 
Since I was small, I was inspired by the clothes; I wanted to go always to my grandmother to rummage in the clothes cupboards of my aunt and to see her clothes. 
This was great to go nearly better than to a leisure park. 
Quite late, as a dancer, I tried to pay attention always to the clothing. 
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in lessons and with the tests to look in the mirror and to feel good, besides.

Before a pair of days you have appeared on the Laufstieg with Naomi Campbell, is this right? 
It is good, do not say something like that. 
It is not in such a way that I went on the Laufstieg to mould. 
Naomi Campbell whom I know since some time has simply called me and has invited to London, around in a parade for the charity arrangement of her organization ` women for a better world ' and the clothes which we show to take part. I know that two garments from our collection were auctioned for mango to collect the money for Naomis NGO. 
The people do not know Naomis good heart. 
Many things about them are told. I when that which she knows, would say to you that they are not right. 
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved. 
She asked me in the parade for this majority-sweet thing to take part, but if it comes and asks me to do a hand state, I will also do this. 
To support the women in the Third World what is also necessary.
