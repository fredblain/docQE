CSU: Mercy on time 
At the end of October it is decided on the destiny of the liked duet Huber-baker's stone 
In spite of the electoral debacle still no heads roll meanwhile, at the head of the Bavarian CSU the personnel debates were adjourned. 
Party chief Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein still remain in her offices, the question is only, how long this mercy lasts. 
On the destiny of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent vocal loss it is decided on the last October week-end with the extraordinary Party Congress. 
However, the a lot of scolded duet look though already let that it would not like to stick on her armchairs. 
With it they want to calm the angry faction and the party base which one day after the " Bavarian Tsunami " in view of the loss of the absolute majority personal consequences demanded. 
Five years ago - added, under the guidance of Edmund Stoiber standing in his career climax - the Christian-social union still reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, a year after the putsch against Stoiber they could protect only 43.4 percent of the voices. 
The CSU was during 46 years "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria which gains 18 percent of the German BIP. 
Indeed, the conservatives remain the decisive strength in the southern federal state also important for the Hungarian economy, however, will have to rule from now on in a coalition. 
As the first sign of the party-internal restructuring potential successor Hubers, vice-president and federal agrarian minister Horst Seehofer is also integrated into the investigation team which leads with the liberal FDP, or the legal-directed " free voters " exploratory discussions about a possible Munich coalition. 
It amounts to an irony of the destiny that with the list " free voters " that Gabriele Pauli come in the legislation whose anti-Stoiber appearance has used the Huber-baker's stone duet first to clear then the single-minded politician pitilessly. 
Now the CSU guidance concentrates all her forces upon the stabilization of baker's stone. 
In this transitional process will come up Stoiber who pulled up to now the threads from the background an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU-presiding called 28th September the " most bitter day of his political career ". 
On Monday Huber did a few toxic remarks in the direction of CDP - according to his view the CSU far have earned more support of the sister party. 
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat than one signal to the CDP and with it also to Angela Merkel. 
Should the CSU which has contributed in 2005 also at national level a lot to the success with a common strength act again on the legs not be put, Merkel after the elections to the Bundestag in September, 2009 cannot become again a chancellor. 
Merkel which has done no secret from her disappointment about the fiasco believes that the terrain loss of the CSU does not affect negatively the big coalition in Berlin. 
What is relative, however: The wounded CSU becomes not lighter be to be ruled, and the crisis of the social democrats goes on meanwhile. 
With 18.6 percent SPD reached her result best up to now in Bavaria since 1946.
