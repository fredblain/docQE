Also rats have feelings 
A rat or a cockroach flees with danger this is called that it also feels fear? 
Neuro scientist Joseph LeDoux is persuaded: Also a lot of animals have feelings. 
Only how could one check whether do they feel the same if they behave as we? 
In the Internet magazine "Edge" contributions of famous scientists are published since several years. 
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents well-chosen answers to the question in a series " What do you hold for true without being able to prove it? " 
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without I or somebody could prove, otherwise, this up to now where we not even can prove that other people have consciousness. 
But in this case we may hope at least, because all human brains show the same basic configuration. 
As soon as we turn, nevertheless, other species and cut questions of the feeling or quite in general the consciousness, we enter impassable area because the hardware does not agree. 
If a rat gets in danger, it does the same to how many other animals: She pretends to be dead, flees or attacks. 
People behave similarly from which some scientists on a comparable subjective experience close. 
However, I do not believe in it. 
Two aspects of the cerebral structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience on that of animals. 
On the one hand, the switching circuits almost always related with the human consciousness enclose the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of his participation in the short-term memory and to the execution-/control functions). 
This wide region is developed with the person much higher than with the remaining primates and seems to be absent with other creatures totally. 
At least with those aspects of our consciousness which depend on the prefrontal cortex, under it the knowledge who we are and to plan the ability and to decide reason for the acceptance insists that the person differs even from the other primates. 
An other dramatic characteristic might lie in the linguistic nature of the person: Because such a big part of his experience is connected with language, one often says, the consciousness depends on it. 
In this case one could exclude animals. 
However, even if consciousness would not depend on language, this would influence it indeed, so that procure animal consciousness, how it may also be, would probably make a distinction very much from most of our consciousness states. 
Therefore, it is heavy to determine how consciousness may look to other animals. 
If it can be measured, as something boarder and subjective, neither, nor, analyzed because of the special hardware, with the help of our own experience, his investigation puts us before big problems. 
Most of my executions refer to the contents of the deliberate experience, however, there is besides still an other aspect of the consciousness which might be academically easy accessible. 
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without taking into consideration her contents, and exactly this happens with studies about the short-term memory of primates, in particular at the example of the visualization. 
However, with this beginning which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed one moves himself rather to the neuralen correlatives of the consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical or also not. 
Interestingly this beginning also stresses the meaning of the prefrontal cortex for the realization of the visualization. 
What arises now for the sensations? 
I lead back them on the fact that an emotional system is activated like that to the fear in one of his own activity deliberate brain. 
What we call "fear", is the mental state in which we are, if the activity of the defensive system localized in the brain (or their results, as physical reactions) working memory covers. 
Thus seen sensations are narrowly bound to the regions of the cortex which distinguish to primates and in particular the people. 
To groups with the linguistic nature fine gradations of the feeling arise because we can differentiate states with the help of the words and the grammar and categorize to ascribe them beside ourselves also to others. 
On the other hand, for instance, Antonio Damasio thinks that sensations from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the cortex and the brain trunk arise like Jaak Pankseep which concentrates, nevertheless, more upon the brain trunk. 
Because this network has not changed in the course of the human evolution very much, it can be absolutely involved in type-covering sensations. 
Pure theoretically I cannot contradict him, nevertheless, it holds for unprovable. 
Pankseep argues what appears with rats and people like fear, probably feels also in both cases thus: How, however, can one check whether do rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly? 
A cockroach flees with danger whether also them fear feels? 
In my eyes bare behavioral resemblance can still prove no experience equality. 
Indeed, the neurale comparison helps: Rats and people not even have similar brain trunks, cockroaches against it a brain. 
However, is the brain trunk responsible for sensations? 
And even if one could prove for the person: How wanted one to prove it with rats? 
I believe, that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), sensations have. 
But I would not know how I should prove this. 
And because her sensations presumably differ basically from ours (there the human consciousness on special switching circuits and on language was based), I investigate rather the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats. 
In any case, waves here progress at the neuralen level, provided that one misses the same with rats and people. 
How I do not investigate language and consciousness with rats, nevertheless, thus also sensations, I do not know not whether they exist. 
One may hold that for shortsighted, but I make headway rather, than to run constantly against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist.
