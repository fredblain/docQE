Duel on knife edge: MP3 player against mobile phones. 
We discuss you by your choice 
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still call up. 
Hence, it looks of course in such a way that it is better to buy itself one phone only. 
In spite of all there are enough reasons for it, why one should get an independent player. 
The choice completely depends on the kind of the use and the claims of the future owner. 
Certainly one with difficulty buys himself for a great expensive record player at home to sound the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc on it. 
Once do not appear such musical novelties on LPs, and from qualitative view there is also no objective reason for it. 
If you have, nevertheless, LPs with kind of rock, jazz or blues in the shelve, probably dream at least of such. 
Thus that is also with the music on traveling, thus with compressed music, simplifies expressed - music in the MP3 format. 
Also here there are price ranges and high-class categories. 
For one it is not maybe satisfactory to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, also a Pink Floyd fan will take earphone for twenty crowns of the market, however, probably with difficulty. 
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everybody. 
The choice is broadly diversified. 
Also the life span of the batteries is vital. 
Some good Music player can play even more than only music, but they not even create that what mobile phones can do by way of a hint. 
No modern device is to be used as universally as the phone. 
Beside the primary functions, the phoning and the ledge, it can return music and videos, both take up, it has sometimes a better, sometimes a worse camera and can also navigate maybe. 
And if one still includes the smart phons and Kommunikatoren, one has almost one small computer in the pocket. 
It is a small miracle, because no fridge can have a barbecue and no television take photos. 
However, the universality of the mobile phones also brings disadvantages with itself. 
The more functions you are of use on your mobile phone, nevertheless, the more often you will have to reload it. 
And playing of music is one of the biggest energy eaters. 
Only few mobile phones can play music longer than ten twelve hours, mostly it is much less. 
In this regard Music player (especially easiest) are much more efficient. 
Therefore, you should calculate with the cheap mobile phones on the fact that they can pass the ball no longer as a few hours of music. 
If you still call up then from time to time, buy yourselves to the security rather one more battery charger for office - this also counts to more expensive devices. 
With MP3-Playern you will not have this problem, also the less good ones stand at least 9 hours uninterrupted company all of a sudden loading. 
Another problem exists when one wants to cover up the music on the mobile phone. 
Unfortunately, only a low part of the devices disposes of an USB end, in addition, every mobile phone cannot be connected without special software directly a PC. 
Of course one can cover up the music directly on a memory medium, however, only few map readers finishes without reduction with the tiny memory maps which are used on mobile phones. 
With Playern you need up to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
They need to feed the device only about USB port on music from your PC. 
Most mobile phones and player put on themselves a music library, regular after the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for instance, the assessment by users. 
Some devices illustrate only the tree structure of the address list, like of Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system). 
Player are lighter to serve, mobile phones can more 
With the choice of a concrete device you should inquire in particular after the life span of the accumulator, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and of course also to the ease of use. 
If music is for you above all a scenery and hear them every day only briefly, for instance, in the streetcar, then reaches any mobile phone which plays MP3 files. 
What can do really already almost every mobile phone. 
They must also not control particularly which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process. 
MP3 create everything, and most music which you get will be just in this format. 
The format belongs to the mostly widespread, and, in addition, most devices can also play music in the WMA format. 
Less usually is AAC (a format, the Apple and his iPods use). 
Better mobile phones likewise allow the purchase of music on-line. 
One needs to call only on mobile Internet the suitable sides of a provider (or another supplier), and already one can acquire a song or album. 
This service can be already actually an apt argument for it, why one should get a music mobile phone. 
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and limits itself mostly only to quick radiohits. 
The prices are not also the lowest ones. 
In general, however, one assumes from the fact that just of such type of the sales of music (it is about GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in future the music industry will control. 
The mobile phone carry most on himself. 
If you have desire to sound something, reach for the mobile phone in the jacket pocket, while the player forget at home lies. 
Nevertheless, it depends on whether you also carry always earphone or at least one wireless handsfree equipment on yourselves. 
If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker over which almost every mobile phone disposes, but only the least MP3 player. 
The probably biggest advantage of the music mobile phones will lie for many in the price. 
The cheapest ones ordinarily cost less than 3,000 crowns. 
For 3000 and 4000 crowns you already get a quite decent Walkman. 
The biggest handicap will be for most that no normal earphones are present. 
The best and technically most mature phones with a 3.5-mm opening for normal earphones cost up to 15,000 crowns. 
The advantage the player lies again in the light service. 
Really everybody can serve the easiest - and not necessarily cheapest (see choice) - player. 
A minimum of functions, the resemblance with the service with the earlier normal cassette recorder or, for instance, the record player is evident. 
No collision threatens in form of incorrectly hired mobile Internet and an afterwards shocking calculation for data transfers. 
For which device one should reach now 
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g., Vodafone 527) dispose as a rule of a slot for interchangeable memory media (type Mï¿½, microSD among other things). 
Even if you a corresponding one plays cards postshop, are sufficient 2,000 crowns. 
However, esteem. 
With the base models only maps with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported as a rule. 
Only the most expensive ones can also read 8-GB-memory maps. 
If you already want to own a mobile phone and buy to yourselves still an inexpensive MP3 player, then you reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
Then according to capacity (max. 2 GB) you must lay no more as 1,100 crowns on the table. 
Belong to the more demanding listeners, take rather specified mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent operating buttons for MP3, and the ease of use approaches thus that of a single MP3 player. 
Here farthest Sony is Ericsson whose mobile phones from the series Walkman have the same user's interface like the individually sold MP3 player. 
The same services in the same price range from up to 4,000 crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long accumulator life span (ordinarily 15 hours, at most up to 35 hours) perform MP3 player of the abovementioned manufacturers to you.
