The USA. The financial breakdown leaves his tracks also with journalists: In the newspapers one can already feel the shortenings. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press. 
500 American journalists were questioned by the centre PEW Research about her situation and her mental control the future concerning. 
Today almost all journalists are pessimistically what her future it begins. 
Still they did not explain towards to him the information concerning responsible really anxiously because of the general credibility. 
They feel not so alone as earlier. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model which was destroyed. 
There the big problems come by the shortenings hitting the Newsroom, thus of the space in which the editors work to put together the newspaper. 
It concerns a problem which must be solved? so the interviewed journalists? if one wants to prevent that the traditional journalism, as the big audience understands him, shrinks not substantially. 
Today a clear, but complex pessimism fulfils the American journalist. 
Six of ten journalists and Executive of boss of the printing press are of the opinion that the journalism on national level on the wrong way is. 
In the local area these are with the Executives even to 65%. 
Printed versus Broadcast. 
It is not difficultly for the journalists to fancy itself to which direction the web goes. 
The most important publishing company groups make a way the way on the Internet which is looked by many as the "killer" of the printing press. 
The " economic pressure " which the journalists feel has risen around up to 79%. 
500 interviewed journalists have admitted wanting to join to the new technology, in hope " she brings something good for the journalism ". 
The biggest tear exists in the American journalism today between the editors in chief newsroom and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of the editors in chief on national level are sure, her reporters divide her values with them, while there are only 23% at local level. 
Some think, it has to act with the " security in the work ". 
The managers who have fear to lose her work within three years amount to 47% at national level. 
With the journalists there are 30%.

In a gigantic nation, as it the USA are, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio stations and TV transmitters and Internet operators, the employers offer like they like and thus it becomes a question from take it or leave it. 
The editors in chief very often get very much high wages, the editor against it can get now and again only 10,000 euros per month, in addition pension money and insurance money. 
What concerns the vacation, the thing is complicated: a certain amount during days in the first year, thus and so many after the third to reach 15 holidays, in the end, after a certain number of years. 
But the American journalists become as they themselves admit, in the course of the year often "ill". 
It is a question of the climate.
