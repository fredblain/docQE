For the Olympic games the streets fall short in Madrid. 
Yes which is a dream many of us to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, nevertheless, after the failure for 2012, it can be maybe in 2016. 
But I ask myself: ` Are we prepared for it? ' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not right! 
It was called perfect street, and according to my judgement, it was the worst street with all around and in it which there was. 
Of course this is an amount of nonsense if one followed the assessment and I could check it, would not have come through something so unambiguously. 
But, we go through from the outset everything. 
The nonsense starts the Ticketholen which allows to you to go as more first. 
It also does not seem to me to be bad, but if they allow to already go forward you, they should also give to you everything (including chip to avoid the traffic jam on the street). 
Thus, nevertheless, not. 
Here they let you only get the ticket (the first nonsense which consists in passing only, so,) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! There was the T-shirt only in the size ` hall' (the second nonsense because I need the size XL) 
Where do we live then, actually? 
Or is it in such a way that was decided after the crisis only small to buy much cheaper shirts from less material? 
Thus well, things like this are a little thing in comparison to the days on the street. 
Apart from the fact that one must go very early to get the chip, is there already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, one must leave the backpack. 
The waiting has lasted more than 35 minutes what is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected. 
In the end how it was also to be expected, the street started and we did not have our back bags before it leave, even if one had succeeded once, but to fetch back them would be quite difficult. 
In addition, it looked, in these 40-minute waiting period after rain, so that it came to the temptation to organize a national uprising and to attack the small house. 
I believe, mornings will have absolutely some 500 people pneumonia and some like I will appear because of this chip which I have got not even on time with the classification, I can already imagine that the exit was wrong stamped. 
Naturally if one asked me for a perfect street, this street would never occur to me. 
Thus I believe, we will still dream long of a town which is well prepared for the Olympic games
