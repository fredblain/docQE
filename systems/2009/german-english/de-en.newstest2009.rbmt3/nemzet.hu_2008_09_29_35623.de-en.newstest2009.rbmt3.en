Press review of the German-speaking space 
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more self-confident within the camp - "Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria. 
In Austria Haider und Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition. 
Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the on-line issue of the German news magazine settled on the left Franz Walter analyzes the reasons of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article " revolution of Bavaria exterminates her fathers ". 
In the opinion of the famous political scientist the erosion of the CSU for a long time before began the sad baker's stone Huber duet his offices took over. 
The Christian-social have renewed Bavaria for decades - now just the modern citizens of them turn away. 
The epoch break is at the same time a problem of the Christian's democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel. 
Quite unexpectedly there did not come the disaster of the CSU, but on Sunday has come to an end a little bit what stood out, however, already quite precisely ten years ago: the indubitable hegemony of a state party 
Since already ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU lands at 47.7 percent and fell with it for the first time since the fifties under the 50-percent brand 
This recurred three years ago with the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, thus still in the much quoted Stoiber's era. 
From the CSU in the federal state strictly pursued modernization has exterminated finally her own mothers and fathers. 
Sociologists had forecast already 40 years ago, besides, had misjudged, however, in the tempo considerably. However, without consequences the S�kularisierung, the educational success, the inflow of East Germans and North German in the prospering regions of Bavaria on the loyalty could not remain the CSU voter. 
Modernization always goes along with option increase. And this has political results. 
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and more unconventional. 
It is remarkable that during the last weeks almost the classical civil groups expressed the biggest distance to the CSU: the independent professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voter with school-leaving exam like Master's certificate. 
Here the support of the CSU on dropped even less than 40 percent.
