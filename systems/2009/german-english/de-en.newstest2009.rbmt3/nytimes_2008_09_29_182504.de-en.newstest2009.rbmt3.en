The last month Gebrselassie has let out the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because of fear which was maybe exaggerated in the Nachhinein that the air pollution could aggravate his asthma problems. 
Instead, he has announced himself for the competition in Berlin. 
In almost ideal conditions - with the sun and 9 degrees in the start and 13 degrees in the purpose - Gebrselassie at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile has won.

After his victory on Sunday Gebrselassie of the press has informed, he would have had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and, therefore, could not train one week. 
Obviously he is refreshed after break and not rusty come back. 
" I am so happy ", he said to reporters. 
" Everything has run perfectly. 
I have taken up the training one week ago again and had even today some doubts, however, at the end what everything really. " 
He was criticized for it - in particular in Kenya, rivals of Ethiopia from East Africa - that he orchestrates his racing runs excessively many world-best marathon stars avoids in general, counts too much on the racing leaders, as if that was a road running, and it puts world records about the competition. 
However, this criticism barely damages to the size Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner. 
Accompanied by four Kenioians on Sunday Gebrselassie had reached the center of the distance in 1:02:04. 
Two ï¿½lite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have Gebrselassie furthermore challenges, after the tempo doers had decreased. 
A little bit more than three miles before the finish Gebrselassie has done his last beginning to separate from Kwambai which has come as second in 2:05:36 and has improved with it his best time about nearly 5 minutes. 
Kamathi became a third in 2:07:48.

She has missed the plays in Beijing, because of problems which became as a back injury to described ones. However, she has recovered to win in Berlin and to improve her best time in her third marathon about five minutes. 
She has planned her run cleverly, while it allowed to only tear out a quartet from Ethiopian and Kenyan runners, but overtaken after 30 kilometers.
