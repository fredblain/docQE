Dusseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt 
There are enough big words in the letter of the WestLB board of directors to the employees of the house. 
" The central capital market house of the savings banks-finance group " can originate from bringing together of unities of the Dusseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt ten gramms bank, one says in the writing known on Monday. 
The WestLB would introduce a "competence block" with lasting profit strength in such business. 
And generally such a connection can be the determining impulse to other groupings in the land banks sector. 
Thus it reads if a board of directors wants to demonstrate legal capacity in difficult time. 
Since the groggy WestLB stands still under immense pressure. 
Not only to find a future solution on the part of the EU committee, but also by the federal institution for the finance service supervision which has made clear to the nordrhein Westphalian government only a short time ago which urges time. 
From an as usual disposed connection between the ten gramms bank, the savings bank customers because of her investment funds know, and, however, the WestLB is already since some time the speech - also on Frankfurt side. 
Indeed, ten gramms bank boss Franz Waas let with the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August know, in a coalescence of the house in the Mainz country road with a land bank, possibly the Helaba or the WestLB, sees he no sense. 
However, the administrative council the ten gramms which are ever carried half of it by the land banks and the savings bank federations has asked the board of directors to lead conversations about common commercial activities with the WestLB. 
Besides, it could walk away around the capital market business or parts. 
The conversations have, admittedly, one says on the finance place, begun scarcely. 
From the ten gramms bank which counts Frankfurt with her 3000 employees to the more important employers on the finance place is not for the first time the speech if it is about consolidation in the savings bank sector. 
In 2003 it looked a moment long in such a way as if the ten gramms bank with the land bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba can merge. 
Nevertheless, from this three alliance nothing became. 
The plans had barely become public, the Hessian government expressed itself against a participation of the Helaba in it. 
Also both other houses did not find then to each other. 
The land bank of Rhineland-Palatinate went instead of this to the land bank of Baden-Wurttemberg in Stuttgart. 
However, there have been over and over again plays of thought about a connection of the ten gramms bank with land banks. 
Last, however, had expressed itself Gï¿½nther Merl, chairman of the board of the Helaba, against plan plays about uniting with his house. 
However, no matter the knowledge seems to mature that moving together the different houses of the public law sector does need. 
After now the election to Landtag is over in Bavaria, a connection of the BayernLB with the land bank of Baden-Wurttemberg could get closer as the first. 
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news. 
Should the pressure rise to other coalescences, the partners go out to her bit by bit for it. 
In the south she would be only a junior partner, although they the financial crisis got through up to now by far better has than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
To one uniting with the west LB again the savings bank federation and giro federation of Hessen Thuringia which is involved with 85 percent in the Helaba at the beginning of the year has pushed forward a bolt. 
If at most the north LB remained. 
However, such geostrategical considerations are only one side. 
On the others it is about the question as the different commercial models of the single houses fit to each other. 
In June Merl, the determining question expressed with which commercial model the future ability of the land banks should be guaranteed, has not been answered by the German savings bank federation and giro federation up to now. 
At the end a decomposition the west LB which is not wished, however, there naturally could also stand. 
Thus is then also in the letter of the board of directors there of it the speech, a "whole solution" is aimed anyway for the house. 
How the unities single with uniting with the ten gramms bank allow to bring under a hat, will still appear.
