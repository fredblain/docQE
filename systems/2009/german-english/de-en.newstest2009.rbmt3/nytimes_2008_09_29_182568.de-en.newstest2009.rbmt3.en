Obscure street in town forget often and, perhaps, soon to sell 
New York city has thousands of main thoroughfares, avenues, side routes and other by-pass roads from what some are famous and only comfortable other. 
Still it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing local to say where extra Place is, simply because most have never belonged of it. 
This tiny street is in the East Village and runs from the ridge Street in the direction of north between Bowery and Second avenue without reaching the Second Street. 
She is wide 30 feet and 120 feet long and looks rather after a dusty lane than after actively used Durchfahrtstrasse. 
There are also no street signs. 
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard-street plan. 
This street still has her admirers. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a building contractor which has recently established luxurious buildings on the ridge Street. 
It wants to pave extra Place anew, around a clean way through to the stores and boutiques which are expected in the new buildings to create. 
To the other admirers belongs the long-standing neighborhood which says, she is entrancedly from the short lane, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the block of houses. 
However, the city administration department which is responsible for protection and establishment of the residential buildings and for which street is responsible has no interest to receive them. 
During a meeting of the committee for land use of the district council this month representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have sketched a suggestion for the purchase of the street for the building contractor. 
Still prefers the committee that the street remains in the hands of the town, and has asked for a new plan which should be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district person responsible in the district council 3. 
" Only very little space has remained in the possession of the town and we might that extra Place has belonged furthermore to the town ", she said. 
" There could be offers how one repairs the street and pursues what could be done by Avalon, however, we also want that the public access remains guaranteed. " 
Avalon Bay has announced some months ago which pave small street anew and furnish seats which are intended, among the rest, for a caf� in which the enterprise would like to rent space. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month. 
Michele de Milly, a speaker of the Avalon Bay, said that, indeed, the enterprise wanted to use the street, it wants not necessarily to own them, however. 
" The preoccupation of the Avalon Bay is to be renovated it this dilapidated lane and to do a public meeting place ", she said and added that the town itself had suggested the sales. 
Seth Donlin, speaker of the department for building protection meant, it has really been the wish of the town to sell the street and stressed, the task of the department is to be developed it rather the real estates than to administer. 
Compared to his colored neighborhood The Bowery, extra Place has maintained somewhat of his historical impression. 
Some believe that the street has got her name in 1802, as a big farm which belonged Philip Minthorne was split between his numerous children and a narrow stripe land was claimed by nobody. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument which was closed in 2006 opened to the extra Place and the street is known certainly mostly as a scenery for the photo on the cover of the album " Rock to Russia " by Ramones. 
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who had done the photo in November, 1976. 
The street was full of scrap metal, rags and parts of barrels, posters, sheets and ropes. 
Some inhabitants, including the Blogger who write about the Gentrifizierung of the East Village have rejected the idea of the sales of extra Place, with the argument that this public property as give as it is, should remain furthermore public. 
Other have praised extra Place than one rarity? a practically unchanged splinter of the town which should be left alone. 
Jeremiah Moss who pursues the Blog called " Jeremiahs evanescent New York " (subtitled with the " book of the complaints: A bitter nostalgic look at the becoming extinct town "), has published a part of the conversation of the town history about extra Place which had appeared in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952. 
At that time the author, Brendan Gill, has written: " Specially Place is a small narrow dead end which remains dark even during the day and is marked by rusted Metallt�re of the warehouses, close windows and along rain channels flying weekly-old newspapers ". 
With few exceptions the street has looked just recently in an evening. 
A rat ran by the rear part of the street, not far from the door which led earlier to the CBGB where today a more expensive clothes business is. 
Graffiti were to be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay not far on the ground from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers. 
Some passers-by said, they would seldom have thought about extra Place, however, suggested that the street could be polished up a little bit. 
Fields, added that according to his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the street in her topical state. 
The prime of life of my life, he said, were dark in the places humid which and were revolting.
