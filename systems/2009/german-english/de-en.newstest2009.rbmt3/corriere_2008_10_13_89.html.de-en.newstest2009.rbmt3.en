The �lite is in danger 
The phenomenon had itself already some days ago reveals when the representative's chamber was right against the 700-billions dollar-savings parcel of the White House: Of a big part the American was and is interested more to punish the embankment Street than to save the economy. 
This confirms the yesterday's issue New York Times which reports about how the crisis divides the republican party in the run which to itself more and more splits in her old and moderate East Coast soul which always favored the state institutions and business community and that neoconservative one which faces " to those in Washington " and the financial world hostilely and wins v. a. in the south and the center of the states voter. 
This part of the party owes his rise v. a. of the voice of that which I mentioned on top. 
This just mentioned example is meanwhile only a small part of the big changes which the momentary economic earthquake announces or even already explains: not only in the USA, also in the whole west and maybe also after this will be concerned by these. 
In the states as well as in Europe the crisis seems to accelerate the long expected events which accept, finally, figure under these new conditions and come to light. 
First of these phenomena the new discovery, the incredible Renaissance of the state is in connection with a kind of Renationalisierung of the economy. 
Indeed, the crisis signifies a decline of the bank ions and financial institution ions which narrow connections with the foreign country own and administer at the same time an immense amount of the property from private house holds which live in one single state. 
This signifies an immediate political problem for the governments: namely as it is a matter to behave in accordance with the affected families which show also a huge electoral mass. 
The crisis seems global economically, political against it she is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems to have got thus to itself in the offside and his speech right to have lost: The clear proof for this has been given by the EU which knows how to find no common way on account of her division in two parts in different national and international conflicts. 
Now, hence, everything count on the intervention of own state; rescue plans, new rules, and v. a. Distribution of auxiliary fund: Since the crisis became more and more serious, merely the USA are to be escaped in the economic position without foreign help. 
And, in addition, beside the means they also own the legitimization this to use: therefore two not too �berwertende conditions? under certain circumstances? on which usually probably no international organization and no market will be able to fall back in similar way. 
That new stress which is laid on the state-national element is, for the rest, in perfect harmony with the bigger and bigger meaning which is associated recently in the economy with one on the narrowest related sector: the Territorialit�t. 
Just now of paradoxical way it is when we however, thus is convincing were to have entered for a long time into a linked up whole empire, in an empire of the always differentiated technologies, the immaterial that we must find out all at once how our future depends, nevertheless, more and more on the essentially material things: Water, harvest and oil. 
Indeed, these can be transported indeed everything by a place in the other of the world, are connected, however, still on extreme with a narrowly umschriebenen piece of earth? to a territory. 
Hence, that is which disposes of such a territory, another towards which lives free area, in the advantage in without crop, without water or from oil occurence. 
Now I come to the second novelty which assumes, nevertheless, a short Einschub. 
Who says territory, who government who says policy with it also Leader-hip. 
In this sense the financial crisis seems to generate two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand is there the knowledge about the necessity respectable Leaderships, thus the need for somebody who knows how one regulates the things. 
Now on the other side exists a wave of the indignation about the existing guidances, v. a. that of the economy which have turned out insufficient and full shadow zones. 
There there comes, in the end, a deep passing and in certain sense even more disconcerting aspect: A trust loss, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of the distance which is all directed on a whole class of managers of the western lands. 
It seems to make a way thus the conviction under big parts of the population the way that these are not only the actions of the social �lite, but already her world of ideas, her Way of Life, her culture in the farthest sense of the word, whose salary explains to the majority as more and more foreign and overcome. 
The inquiry after Leader-hip feeds underground a branched however mighty movement of the loss of power of the leading class and the customary political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the abrupt change of the collective state of mind of the last time: here beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the breakdown of the Labour party in Great Britain, there to the rebellion of the American representatives against Bush (and maybe the victory of the rights in Italy also plays a role). 
One wins the impression as if the old �lite has, her parties, her programs, but also her rites, magazines, to intellectual believers, some one would say her format, more and more understanding problems and, hence, less representative value with regard to that what proceeds nowadays in the lower social layers of the west and is still strengthened by the financial crisis and is done up to �berdimensionalit�t. 
In view of all his one it would be simply exaggerated to speak of a " rebellion of the masses ". 
However, the eyes is not to be kept open far meanwhile certainly.
