Charest places on the north 
The prime minister does not exclude to initiate choices still before the end of the year. 
As soon as the general assembly of the liberal party was to an end, yesterday Jean Charest proceeded to Jean talon in Quebec where new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be chosen in the today's partial choice. 
` Shift the course of our last big border in the north ': This is the long-term purpose which Jean Charest introduced yesterday with visual means with the general assembly of the liberal party of Quebec in Levis and he completely followed the guidelines. 
During his talk a kind of picture mill was projected behind him. 
On three gigantic screens spectacular pictures of hydroelectric power plants, mines, looked turned from Quebec in ` Google Maps', maps, etc. 
Big means like during the electoral period. 
Compared with the press the prime minister refused, by the way to exclude that he will hold the choices this autumn, even if he allowed to be reported that his appointment calendar is very full. 
The ` plan of the north ' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the prime minister has supposedly for Quebec, namely those of a ` new Wirtschaftsraumes' which intends an arrangement with France with regard to manpower, an arrangement between Canada and Europe and arrangements with Ontario. 
Although it was mentioned in the last time often in the speeches of the prime minister, had been the opening of the north - the northern area on the 49sten degree of latitude - never subject of a presentation. 
Nevertheless, the prime minister limited himself to it to explain, why the north is ` a jewel with huge potential ', however, called no date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects. 
At most some views of that in which could be worked more: Above all in the water energy, in the wood, but especially in the mining sector, favors above others by the growth of the threshold lands and the renewal of the public infrastructures. 
Of the enumeration Mr. Charests according to the north owns ` nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamond '. 
This ` area two times largely as France ' ` is in our nearness, is in Quebec. 
It is not only in our nearness, it is in 'us, he stressed to show how around clear that he tries to realize a national founder's dream. 
Quebec has grown very much by his connection with the north, he stressed: the street to the gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James bay. 
` It hears us, it is our future ', he added, after he had inserted a theatrical break to look at the gigantic map behind himself. 
The north, 70% of the area of Quebec, encloses a part of Labrador with which Quebec always called, explained the prime minister compared with the press. 
` This is a traditional posture which all governments pursued. 
There is a borderline in which there is no arrangement since very much long time if the opportunity comes up I will take this posture in the name of the government again ', he explained. 
In addition, ` with the climate change we must think over our vision of the north anew ', he explained and spoke about the northwest passage which will be practicable on account of the ice glazes the whole year. 
Before this new geopolitical background the prime minister thinks that it is almost a duty to take this area. 
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec handled very warily with them, and that they would profit from this project, above all the boys. 
Two former ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel L�tourneau (of former pekistischer representatives of Ungava) have already initiated consultations with about thirty communities. 
One minister's committee escorted by Beno�t Pelletier in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) takes an important place has taken up the works. 
The prime minister does not exclude a big meeting, ` not necessarily a summit ', but an opportunity with which ` one will create a common vision '. 
The development of the north will go, for the rest, according to the principles of the lasting development vonstatten. 
the plan the north is discussed `, is regulated and environmental-carefully ' be, he promised. 
Jean Charest described this 'vision', as if it is a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were before him in the office. 
` Like the liberals who were before us in the office we have rethought to transform the challenges into new growth and Entwicklungschanchen. 
This was, by the way, one of the subjects pouting over and over again of the week-end which was opened on Friday with a big cocktail party to the celebration of the 50-th jubilee of the takeover of the party guidance by Jean Lesage. 
One of the accepted decisions plans to rename the power station of Beauharnois as Ad�lard Godbout dam. 
` From Godbout, Hydro Quebec has created, about Lesage which has reached the quiet revolution and the nationalization of the water electricity, to Bourassa which has done the James bay our party knew how always to determine the future ', explained Jean Charest. 
Compared with the press he referred to another, this time conservative plan, namely on the program ` Roads to the North ' from John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
In relation on the project Water power dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, stresses Mr. Charest which would be planned his introduction for 2012. 
` This remains among us, but I plan to be present ', he entrusted his party members what caused in those thunderous applauses. 
The prime minister who has said in April that there was in 2008, and absolutely also in 2009, no choices, indeed, has the possibility to hold a choice this autumn what is possible to him in accordance with the law, not yet impossible. 
He stresses that his appointment calendar is full, nevertheless, above all because of a mission of the communal council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. 
The general assembly of the week-end got the liberal party chief a platform from nationalistic plans, above all from the ` constitution to concerning sighting ' which was accepted just like that: The PLQ particularly demands the recognition of the ` specific feature Quebecs' in the constitution. 
She would also like to own that Quebec appoints members of the council of the Canadian broadcasting company and telecommunications and that this a veto with regard to the decisions felled in Quebec. 
The guidelines of the plan the north were taken up by sides of the opposition with scepticism. 
The boss of the Parti Qu�b�cois, Pauline Marois, has brought out the policy for the development of north du Quebec again which has introduced government Landry in 2001. 
According to her the liberal government when it came in 2003 to the power has refused to apply this. 
If she had done it, ` today we would be already much other ', judged Mrs. Marois at the side of her nominee in Jean talon (where the choice today takes place) Fran�oise Mercure. 
The ADQ has expressed itself to support the acceptance of a plan the north by the government. 
` But what we want, is that this becomes not only a big image ', explained the party leader S�bastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont who comes back today from the vacation.
