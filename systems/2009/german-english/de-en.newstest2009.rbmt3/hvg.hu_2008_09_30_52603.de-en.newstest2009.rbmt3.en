You are of what you inform about yourself 
On the occasion of her tenth birthday Google with jointing and right can state: it is to be found in the pockets of the people just, how over her heads in the sky: She knows where the people have spent her vacation to which specialists they go, and what she moves. 
And with it not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the managers of Google. 
In the direction of the sceptics who are tormented by Orwellschen horror visions he allows to aim: These would overlook precisely the essentials of the web 2.0. 
In an interview with the Financial Times Schmidt meant recently, the principal purpose of Google is to collect even more personal data about the users and to get closer thus to the original objective of the company after which they " all information of this world order " wants. 
Schmidt explained, Google is after ten years of world-changing work still only at the beginning of the information-collecting. 
Asked after the status Quo in five years Schmidt meant: he wished, Google would be able, should do questions like " What I tomorrow? " or " Which job really fits to me? " to answer, indeed, software programs are not yet in the position in addition, because they would not know enough about the users. 
Not all Internet users are about that in the clear that in the course of her Internet searches the search words would be registered, as well as also the IP addresses from which was searched, and the visited sides. 
For example, "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows to the visitor to store his own searching course and to fall back later on it, so that the hits can be generated later much more exactly, and on the same logic the so-called "Recommendations" with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services on account of the earlier preferences are also based. 
However, the users ask themselves what happens in case of a data abuse - " If one looks what I do " - some are concerned whether of the Google-data mono pole. 
Nevertheless, in most cases it is rather the potential power represented by the company which looks horrific, and less the feeling of guilt or the fear of punishment, the striving for freedom or the clamour against the power which bumps with many Internet users into refusal. 
However, it is a proved fact that the search words not only are stored, but are transmitted in the occasion case also into three parts, and in these law cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user. 
A prime example for this was recently the action against P�dophilie in Brazil in the course of whose Google of the Brazilian government handed information which was collected by the communal site called "Orkut" and also allowed an identification of the P�dophilien. 
However, around personal rights concerned users could draw a deep breath still in May when Google moved together with civil right organization EFF successfully against the FBI in court: therefore, Google can be also made in future with no point of the constitution publish information to the FBI on confidential inquiry. 
(Indeed, the Federal Government has obtained successfully the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search words with reference to the protection of children and young people law adopted years ago, indeed, became to her the list of the single users, or keep their web and search word list for two months retrospectively.) 
Googles image remains controversial: Those which publish her personal data reluctantly because they fear the loss of her private sphere and intimate sphere by the use of the Google services castigate the enterprise with the outrage being due presenting to the conservatively companies. 
Meanwhile sees the American "Geek culture" which is present in many lands and eager computer fans, activist and user unites, which the next generation of the " cool enterprisers " in them, in contrast to Microsoft which is a market leader thanks to Windows, even if both fight for the same purpose. 
A possible reason for this is that Google demands of his users in contrast to Microsoft no identification codes, and makes available his services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be cooler far attractive, more in a juvenile manner and, than the official methods of the software giant. 
On the other hand, the Geeks the problematic relation of the personal rights and the Internet look though shrewdly - a relation which has moved in particular during the past years thanks to the concept " web 2.0 " in the center. 
With the " web 2.0 " it is since about nothing else than speak around collaboration, the users leave intentionally tracks and use the available communication canals, and also if the magnitudes are different individually, the central issue remains the same to be public since. 
An average youngster can administer at the same time on several communal main entrances his profile - from Facebook via Xanga, this can by means of other services, as for example Twitter, or music services like last.fm with each other connect, and can integrate all this, in the end, into a postpursuit system as for example FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead Blogs which show the newest photo galleries automatically which are geocontinual on Flickr or Picasa. 
And a row of other exemplary cases proves: While looking the party photos of the last night the friend soon finds out with whom her disloyal friend has enjoyed himself, or the employee will dismiss because he gives vent in his Blog only much too honestly to his annoyance about the enterprise guidance - one is sure: The concept "Private sphere" was interpreted meanwhile totally anew. 
Who leads an on-line life, is that what he reveals of himself - thus in possibly one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of the today's youth. 
And who tries to keep secret something, or to handle even the Google monopoly, this can act with pleasure - as for example with Scroogle, a tool which accesses, indeed, the searching machine of Google leaves, indeed, intentionally no tracks. 
Not few people do not register intentionally on communal sides, so that they are not discoverable, but also the on-line applications of Google, as for example word processing and graphic tools and RSS-Feeds, can handle with alternative versions which are bound to no gigantic server parks and do not generate, hence, also the best possible profile of the user. 
The public opinion waits meanwhile fascinatedly for it, to Google her true face points. 
With her present value of 156 USD of Bn. the enterprise lies even before IBM (140 USD of Bn.), the income of the advertising agencies threatens Intel (124 USD of Bn.) or Coca Cola (110 USD of Bn.), the advertising surfaces of AdWords/AdSense, and the faster and faster introduced services prepare not only Microsoft, but also to other software developers brainwork. 
However, critical viewers also find the disconcerting counterpoles: Thus possibly the group management has totally rejected a protest of the employees, after the fees of kindergarten belonging to companies were doubled, in addition, the management thought, the repeated catering of the employees is too costly. However, all that seems virtually mildly against the fact that Google went in 2006 before the Chinese government even to the knees and agreed with an arrangement, after which all regime-critical hits, or those which would be filtered out against the good taste expelled. 
The internal regulation of the group is that in Ahead no new service is promoted, but only if this is also quite available. The events of the coming months and years could still turn up something again hard: During some mean, Googles book mass and project Magazinscan or archiving project supposes meanwhile magnitudes that the enterprise soon had to argue with the uppermost court of law, are disturbed other rather because of the system "Health" which allows the production of a complete health profile on the basis of findings, doctors and problems. 
And the Sci Financial Accounting authors already the material - possibly "Scroogled" delivers the fact that Google builds up a genetic data bank to the next generation, famous Roman von Cory Doctorow describes in the best orwellschen manner a future in which a person becomes alarmingly close-cash thanks to data referring by Google.
