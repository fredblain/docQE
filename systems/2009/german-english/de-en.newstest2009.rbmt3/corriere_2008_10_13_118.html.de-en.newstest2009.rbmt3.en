The superglue which allows to rise by walls 
To defeat the forces of the gravitation thanks to a paste and to can do walls hochklettern like superman. 
This is the object of four American research centers from which now apparently almost in the purpose has arrived. 
With one on a surface of only 2.5 sq. cms of angry glue the researchers have succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall. 
The STUDIO? an American magazine has, has published the results of the researchers of the university of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia institutes of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material fictitious by the research team is an advancement of the already used pastes which use a special carbon structure, called Kohlenstoff-Nanor�hrchen. 
" The principle of the glue one can fancy like a row to a pile of spaghetti of arranged tubes ", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia institutes of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists could be inspired by the feet of the geckos which are covered of microscopic tiny hairs which give a perfect hold to the animal. 
With different materials like glass Teflon and sandpaper to carried out tests have shown that the new glue is 10 times stronger than the hold ability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time allows to remove " easily from the wall ", according to Liming Dai, researcher of the faculty for engineer's sciences of the university of Dayton. 
By WALLS ENTLANGWANDERN? " This material could be used as a transient paste ", Liming Dai subjoins. 
Possibly around like Spiderman on walls emporzugehen? Maybe already, however, the researchers think rather of a less fascinating use, as for example the connection of electric devices, because the Nanor�hrchen are also a leader of warmth and electricity. 
Other areas of application could fall in the area of the astronautics. 
For the time being the superheroes must still wait. 
THE OTHER KIND OF THE RESEARCH? also the university of Berkeley, California, devotes itself to a new glue kind. 
In an article of the American Chemical Society the California scientists present a paste from microfibers itself the like hair by movement on a surface even from the dust clean and thereby always a perfect liability preserve.
