If the energy arises from the waves, the tallness suddenly accumulates 
It is a not drying up monetary spring which covers more than 70% of the surface of the planet and only now the big energy companies of the world seem to understand this. 
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources on now everything look, and also try to occupy, possibly giants like chevron. 
The possibility to win energy from the movements of the sea is already considered for 70 years and is examined; not by chance these studies intensified since the first oil crisis substantially. 
As the price of the oil about 1980 broke gasify one the idea of the sea energy, now, however, the environmental organizations and the risen oil price press for new impulses in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the worldwide power demand could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves. 
This would amount to the double of the energy at the moment produced by nuclear power stations. 
In addition, there still the currents and tides would come. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first company which places now on the sea energy is Enersis which has signed in 2005 a contract to the establishment of a power station in the north of Portugal. 
When this news was published it seemed to concern a revolutionary step. 
Now two years later these are more and more companies from the traditional energy branch which place on the marine power production. 
" Chevron examines these technologies "? so the speaker of an enterprise known to the US-American giant in the Wall Street Journal? and if the possibility weighs to cooperate from with us. " 
It is, on this occasion, about the procurement of a licensing of the American energy committee which is necessary to begin a project before the coast of Alaska. 
This is a sign not to be underestimated, v. a. if one thinks that just in Alaska furthermore oil is promoted through the USA and president Bush recently got going only the plans for new drillings. 
Beside chevron are also the proficient Verdant Power Inc from New York and Ocean power from New Jersey which invest in the new branch; if the details are also not known, nevertheless, observers speak of a rising interest. 
Still improvement-worthy technologies. 
Experts speak not least of a technology still being in the departure, this, because yet the last doubts are not cleared by sides of the environmentalists. 
Up to now projects are like that in Portugal and also Scotland of rather small dimension and seem to cause no ecological problems to be taken seriously. 
To produce, nevertheless, energy on a large scale, it requires technologies with far bigger influence on the environment. 
There are different possibilities: Ocean power possibly uses a system of buoys linked with each other. 
The push of the waves which move the buoys on and down is converted within the swimmers about piston and cylinder into hydraulic pressure. 
This drives a turbine which pursues a generator again. 
The stream is sent on it about unterwater pipes to the coast. 
Till present there are four planned arrangements of the this kind which wait only for the state approval. A part of the won energy could also serve for military equipment. 
Verdant power produces meanwhile already energy for a goods department store and a park bib with the help of unterseeischer turbines in the East River of New York. 
The water movements during the tides drives the turbines which feed the generator by the originating rotary movement. 
According to Verdant a long queue of possible clients already waits for the necessary Autorisierungen around these energy sources to be of use. 
Only the waves, then the tides. 
A special interest earns according to the institute of stream production research presently the potential which is in the tides. 
Although it also concerns an irregular phenomenon, nevertheless, the tides are better predictable as wind currents, of the solar irradiation and also the waves, and, hence, a trustworthier stream spring. 
It is just the tidal energy which federal states made like New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states invest already 7.5 million dollars in 2008? for 2009 are already planned up to 35 millions.
