The first virtual supplier already comes this year to Czechia. 
Maybe 
The mobile radio market in Czechia has surely matured, the Czech suppliers offer practically all services how they are also offered by her partners in Western Europe. 
Here, nevertheless, something is absent - a virtual supplier who demands classical for lower prices. 
Maybe this will keep waiting no more long. 
The fact that the Czech mobile radio suppliers work to most expensive in Europe generally, about that we have often enough reported on Mobil.cz. 
This confirmed, by the way, also the telecommunication authority? T � which drew the attention to the fact that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union. 
After the last steps of the European committee in the area of Regulation of the Roaminggeb�hren it comes so probably to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile radio suppliers will be cheaper SMS from abroad than at home. 
How does it come that the prices are so high in Czechia in comparison to Europe? 
The answer is easy, there is no competition which really does a fight announcement. 
Maybe one sounds paradoxical, nevertheless, in Czechia there are three mobile radio nets and a penetration of far more than 100%. 
The mobile radio suppliers get angry against it with pleasure about the fact that there is extremely a lot of competition at the Czech market. 
Pflichtet often also the chairperson of the council of the Czech telecommunication authority (? T �) Pavel Dvo? �k, with which had often expressed in the past that there is no place for an other supplier in Czechia. 
It is probably right that a classical supplier with own net has no more particularly many chances (by the way, he would probably find also hardly frequency). 
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual supplier. 
Just the entry of virtual suppliers on the mobile radio market brought a clear prize lowering with itself to which then also the classical mobile radio suppliers had to react. 
Besides, there were still before the entry of such companies like Tesco mobile or Virgin mobile on the market in Great Britain similar voices like in Czechia. 
However, it has appeared that there is place for such suppliers and that these can be really successful. 
By the way, one does not need to look long for examples. 
In February of this we have reported about the start of virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland. 
In only one half a year this supplier succeeded in winning 100 000 customers more than and in climbing up thus to the 5-greatest supplier of the land. 
Besides, behind Mobilking stands the finance group Penta which owns, among the rest, U:fon in Czechia. 
The advantage of virtual suppliers consists in the fact with the fact that one can concentrate upon a lot of more concrete target group. 
To be able to function actually, virtual suppliers need since much less customers than one classical supplier. 
They need since no relatively high costs for the construction, the company and the entertainment of a mobile net. 
In the world the virtual suppliers distinguish themselves thus ordinarily as a Low Cost companies out - they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS what is accompanied, however, often by a less extensive service offer. 
Thus, for instance, Tesco mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least around half more cheap in than his competitors. 
As, nevertheless, the example of Mobilking points in Poland, it can also be a rather good manoeuvre to place on a not stereotyped target group. 
This supplier is directed since specifically at men. 
" Real guys choose Mobilking - the supplier whom they like and them can trust ", according to David Seibert, the CEO of the mobile entertainment Company, the operator's company of this virtual supplier. 
To say hard whether a similar draft could gain a foothold like in Poland also in Czechia. 
The press agent of Vodafone Miroslav also doubts this? epick �: " The Czech market is for a market segment on which most virtual suppliers are based, relatively small. 
In addition, he is relatively fed from the point of the service offer. " 
In Czechia have no chance, mean the mobile radio suppliers 
However, it is sure almost that if a virtual mobile radio supplier conquers Czechia this will not be Mobilking. 
" Indeed, we talk from an expansion of this successful project, however, in Czechia the negotiations look not particularly hopeful. 
It will come rather for a market entry of Mobilking in other lands of our region ", says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studni? kov�, press agent of the finance group Penta. 
Indirectly she confirmed in such a way that the present mobile radio suppliers are leaned towards in Czechia to this thought not particularly. 
On the contrary, they try to do everything for the fact that no potential competitor originates. 
Their interest in a start of a virtual mobile radio supplier already shows since longer time the group GTS Novera which would like to undertake an other step to become a real competitor of Telef�nica O2 in the area of Corporate client. 
" We have a big interest to offer not only festival net radio, but also mobile radio-telecommunication services to our customers. 
And the earlier, the better. 
We have negotiated about this possibility repeatedly with all Czech mobile radio suppliers. 
With some of them we could already reach negotiations progress ", according to the press agent of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Now maybe there come better times. 
From not official information it arises that the first virtual supplier is maybe to be expected till the end of the year. 
Up to now, however, this is surrounded by an invincible wall of the silence. 
" At this moment we do not assume from the fact that in Czechia place exists for a full virtual supplier. 
The Czech market shows big Spezifika compared with other markets. 
Up to now no subject with a complicated and serious project has appealed to us still in this area ", means in his explanation of Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr? e? from the press department of Telef�nica O2. 
Other suppliers also point to the Spezifik of the Czech market. 
The press agent of T-Mobils Martina Kemrov� adds in rare correspondence with the explanation of O2: " Up to now we have still found no and on both sides advantageous project capable of life on which one could further build. " 
And she adds: " In the net of T-Mobils no virtual supplier will appear till the end of the year. 
At this moment we would already have to be a concrete offer have to be able to think so at short notice. " 
Vodafone directs his attention rather upon the fulfilment of the requirements of own 3G license. 
Miroslav? epick � means about it: " For negotiations with potential virtual suppliers we are open, in particular in the area of Division of costs and infrastructure. 
We look just at this from the point of the customers as the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to the construction of a divided net for quick mobile Internet. " 
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand 
The action of the mobile radio suppliers is light to understand, another supplier would call more competition, this would lead for sinking prices and thereby also to a decline of the profits. 
Why one should make easier to such a competitor the market entry? 
The fact that the suppliers can move in a rope if it is about something, also covers long There and Here around the origin of U:fon. 
The probably strongest pressure in the direction of? T � went out at the moment when U:fon on the market came, from society T-Mobils. 
The publicly accessible information of him also covers this? T � web pages. 
Now, however, just U:fon is suited as an argument, why one should not admit a virtual supplier. 
Martina Kemrov� noted in addition: " The competition sphere of the mobile radio market was recently strengthened, in addition, still by the market entry of the fourth mobile radio supplier. 
Taking into account the character of the mobile radio market in Czech Republic is evident that a new actor would put above all his services high requirements to the market and. " 
However, in view of this approach of the mobile radio suppliers the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulation authorities surprises. 
Besides, it concerns not only the posture of her? T � which does not have the competence in Czech, unfortunately - as opposed to Great Britain and other sophisticated states - to intervene in the economic competition. 
This owns exclusively the office for the protection of the economic competition (� OHS). 
However, this covered his quite typical posture to these whole problems. 
" Then the market entry of a virtual mobile radio supplier would be possible, after it has come for a completion of the contract between a mobile radio supplier and a virtual supplier about the Anmietung of the necessary infrastructure. 
Up to now no such contract was concluded, because the offer of potential prospective customers was likely for the classical suppliers not interesting enough ", thus in his answer to our inquiry Kristi�n Chalupa of the department of outside relations � OHS. 
From representatives of the suppliers such a formulation would not surprise. 
From an authority which the consumer's interests represent and, among the rest, on the fact should pay attention that nobody abuses his position at the market this is more than questionably. 
In particular if Kristi�n Chalupa adds: " Abroad where virtual suppliers work quite normally, is to be observed that her market entry has contributed to a prize lowering with mobile phone services. " 
Probably, however, do not belong the pressure on correct functioning of the market and a prize lowering to the interests � OHS. 
The almost quite moving harmony of three mobile radio suppliers who arises from her reactions is really shocking in this case. 
The question whether it concerns really only a chance is obvious. 
Just as the absolutely same cost of petrol is only a chance and the result of a hard competition with the gas stations certainly. 
" The authority has discovered in this thing no sign which point to an action directed against the competition, and therefore she also has no reason to intervene somehow in the affair. 
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, therefore he also does not have the suitable raised responsibility for his action at the market. 
The regulation authority for telecommunications " also lacks the necessary instruments for an opening of the mobile radio market for virtual suppliers probably, Chalupa stated in his explanation. 
The interpretation of the dominating position at the market is one of many debatable points. 
Of course there is an analysis of the relevant markets, worked out by that? T �, after the telecommunications from the point of the economic competition one single market is. 
Then at such a market none of the Czech mobile radio suppliers holds of course a dominating position. 
However, some legal experts offer another perception - the approval of the net operator is necessary always for the market entry of a virtual supplier. 
And the mobile radio supplier has - logically - for his net the monopoly. 
It means that he takes necessarily a dominating position in a certain segment. 
Even if one does not go along, however, with this argumentation, it should be for � OHS at least a warning that three mobile radio suppliers go forward strikingly similarly. 
Besides, discomfort of a row of prospective customers (including mentioned society GTS Novera) proves that they bump at negotiations with all suppliers into very similar obstacles. 
The shifting of the responsibility on them? Then T � is in the telecommunication services a rather usual trick with which dissociates itself � OHS from the whole affair. 
This was already to be observed in some similar cases. 
Unfortunately, has it not succeeded, in the recently adopted novella of the telecommunication law the extension of the competence? To put through T � on the area of the economic competition in the telecommunications, although a row of experts of it had promised to itself an improvement of the situation. 
The representatives � OHS must know this only much too well, however, probably they have other interests. 
It already goes if nobody looks 
Unnoticed functioning some pseudovirtueller supplier from which there are immediately several in the Czech mobile radio nets remains first of all. 
These are companies which spend own price-lists on mobile telecommunication services which are public, nevertheless, only partly. 
Ordinarily it concerns since the companies which operate in the area of Multilevel-marketing. 
Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others. 
The price-lists of these companies ordinarily reach only to chosen. 
The joke of the thing consists in the fact that the company appears towards the operator as a classical corporate client which orders a large amount in SIM maps. 
Then as an important customer he receives special offers (and other offers). 
The problem consists in the fact that the terms of business of all Czech mobile radio suppliers forbid a similarly disposed resale. 
" Should there be cases which you describe, then it can concern an injury of the contractual conditions with which we will deal then what can lead to an ending of the collaboration with the suitable society ", answered Martina Kemrov� to our question to this problem. 
However, it is rather unlikely that such a thing does not get about with the persons responsible of the mobile radio suppliers. 
In particular in the case of three mentioned companies it can concern thousands of customers. 
Nevertheless, no operator opposes such an action. 
From the activity of these companies profits to be neglected do not run towards them since, at the same time they are not impaired - as opposed to the actual virtual suppliers - by the real official marketing. 
On possible problems does Miroslav? epick � carefully: " The law allows such kinds of speculations, in spite of all the services of these companies are used only by a very low percentage of the customers. 
In addition, these must accept that the SIM map does not run in her phone on her name, they cannot dispose adequately of it like the normal customers of the mobile radio suppliers. " 
Quite only this, however, must go to her? T � seem at least strangely. 
In addition, an other question presents itself for � OHS. 
Do the mobile radio suppliers close the eyes before such an action, why do they balk at a virtual supplier? 
It is to be added that � OHS to the disclosure of such activities has rather strong competence, and if it does not want, it must not itself with the explanation of the suppliers, they would know nothing about it and her terms of business would forbid this, be content. 
When Czechia is the most expensive no more 
As in the text already several times was stressed, the market entry of virtual suppliers brought a clear prize decline with the different services with itself. 
Besides, the classical suppliers have tried practically in all lands where virtual suppliers have originated to prevent origin practically more or less. 
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a too smaller, or too much saturated market, problems with the quality of the services etc. 
In the sophisticated lands, however, intervened just at these moments the regulation organs which tried to protect by no means the interests of the mobile radio suppliers, but of her customers. 
If it is by formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator originated, and other ones followed this. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulation organs throw to themselves the whole case like a hot potato. 
Outgoing from our experiences we cannot rid ourselves of the impression that lack of clarity is favorable in the competence in these cases more than. 
However, we do not throw the gun in the grain. 
If the background information is right and soon a virtual supplier appears, the Czech mobile radio market will start moving maybe soon again. 
If a supplier admits the origin of a virtual mobile radio supplier, will not remain � OHS inactive if it is a matter of (to discriminating to reject other prospective customers. 
And, finally, then the Czechs will call up no more expensive as the rest of Europe.
