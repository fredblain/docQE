Believers have less pains? 
How the newest research results prove that the religious faith works like a kind of "painkiller" which should already have made easier the death of Catholic martyrs. 
Scientists Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It was examined, to what extent the faith in God influences the pain feeling of the person, the British sheet of "telegraph" announced. 
In the course of the rather weird investigation received 12 believers and atheists electroshock therapies, while they studied a painting of the mother of God. 
As the results pointed, the believers could switch off the large part of pains. 
By means of a Brain-scan technology could be even proved that the Catholics could activate the part of her brain which is responsible for the pain regulation. 
The investigation was first in a research project in which beside scientists also philosophers and theologians of different departments of the university take part. 
With the attempt a sparkling device was bound the test persons to the left hand which delivered the electroshock therapies. 
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly upon two paintings: On the one hand, a picture of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17-th century, and to the other Leonardo there Vincis " lady with the ermine ". 
The researchers hoped that the sight of virgin Maria would cause a kind of religious trance among the believers, while they selected there Vincis picture because it barely differed from the other painting and than was felt reassuringly. 
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in a scanner MRI, and received a total of 20 electroshock therapies in four stages in this time, while they should look either at the religious, or at the other painting. 
The Catholics reported, they would have felt at the sight of the mother of God " in security ", as if they were "looked", and they would have felt " rest and peace ". 
During the Betrachtens of the religious painting they have reported more than 12% less pains, as if they had Leonardos work with eyes. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias who likewise took part in the attempt meant, one could cause similar effects also with other, very active pictures also in the atheists, one would have to find only the suitable photo. 
" We would have to find a picture which releases very positive sensations, as for example a mother or a father ", according to the psychologist. 
Anglican bishop Tom Wright greeted the results of the research. 
" Carrying out the belief should change our personality, and does it also in many cases ", according to Wright. 
After these excellent results only the question remains which effect a Madonna's picture Leonardos or another comparable painter on the pain regulation of the believers would have. 
Would qualitatively high-quality virgin Maria still become better results achieve?
