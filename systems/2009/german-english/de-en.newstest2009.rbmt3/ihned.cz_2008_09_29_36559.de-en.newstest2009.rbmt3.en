Congress does concession: US government may pump 700 billion dollars into the banks 
The uppermost representatives of the American congress and the government of president George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on a financial assistance for the American financial system. 
About that it should be tuned in the beginning of the next week. 
The American legislators reached in conversations about the discharge of a rescue plan in form of a financial assistance for the American financial system in a circumference from 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillions crowns) a breakthrough. 
Indeed, this still signifies no victory. 
The congressional representatives must negotiate since still some details of the arrangement, before they may publish the final version of the law and vote about that. 
The plan to the support of the financial system is negotiated on Monday in the American congress. 
On Sunday the chairperson of the committee said this for bank services and finance services Barney Frank of the agency Reuters. 
In the senate could be tuned according to different information probably at the earliest on Wednesday about the plan. 
According to small farmer a communication about the fact that the plan is dismissed should be the first significant psychological factor for a stimulation of the finance markets. 
Nevertheless, then it comes to a "disillusionment" on account of the complex mechanisms as one could help the markets also in practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
" We have achieved a significant progress. 
We have cleared our different views to how a parcel should look to the stabilization of the market ", said compared with the agency Bloomberg the democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
According to your words it could still come on Sunday for a final vote. 
Representatives of the legislators met on the night of Sunday the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson to lend his final form to the government fund. 
This intends a purchase of mortgage assets unfor sale of the finance societies which overthrow the finance companies in heavy losses and endanger the stability of the whole system. 
" We stand on the edge of a definitive arrangement on a plan which will function and must be also effective at the market. 
One must continue the recovery plan even further, however, I think, we are in the purpose ", according to Paulson. 
A signal for Asia shops 
The global financial crisis is also reflected clearly in the stock markets which strongly sink. 
To the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, according to the legislators try hard to reach still before Sunday in the congress to a final arrangement. 
With it one wants to calm since the investors before shops at the Asian finance markets which lie in the first time zone where a decision of the congress could influence the shops on Monday. 
Up to now, however, is not quite clear yet, when both chambers of the American congress about the law will vote, also lack of clarity rules over whether the negotiations could not fail at the last minute, nevertheless, still because of a problem. 
The legislators hope that it is dismissed during the next days. 
However, the law will still find out some changes. 
For the help to the system certain total should be divided into two parts. 
The initial 350 billion dollars should be provided as fast as possible as president George Bush demanded. 
However, the congress can block the payment of the remaining money if he has the impression that the program does not fulfil his function, namely with other 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars. 
Bush evaluates progress in negotiations positively 
Indeed, the president has a veto power by this decision, indeed, the congress can outvote his veto. 
Nevertheless, in spite of these changes the basic idea of the program has continued which been based on it, finances for the purchase of the bad mortgage securities whose value has liked to attain because hundred thousands of Americans are able no more to pay back her mortgages. 
" We have worked out everything. 
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday about the law, the senate then on Monday ", according to republican senator Judd Gregg. 
With the progress American president Bush also appeared contently. 
His speaker Tony Fratto explained, Bush is contented with the progress of Saturday and " estimates the on both sides endeavours to stabilize our finance markets and to protect our economy ". 
Restriction of golden parachutes 
The chairperson of the bank committee of the senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, allowed to announce, the legislators would have agreed on a responsibility for the monetary program, the protection of the taxpayers before losses, the end of Vergï¿½nstigungen and a schedule for the financing of the plan. 
The new law should also limit the so-called golden parachutes for managers of the societies who are involved in the program and uses a committee upon which the supervision about the fund should be incumbent. 
The Ministry of Finance should lead this. 
" We have worked very hard on it and have reached a big progress in the direction of an arrangement which is functioned and is important for the market and for all Americans ", according to Paulson. 
The plan also counts on a help to house owner which problems have with the repayment of her mortgage. 
The government should negotiate new rates with mortgages which it buys up and the purpose consists in it to lower the monthly costs for the debtors and to allow it to them, to keep her houses. 
Marek: Psychological help 
The suggested plan is after the main small farmer of Patria Finance David Marek a good idea, however, the conversion becomes very difficult. 
" Namely, because one does not know by which mechanism and around which price the problematic assets are bought up. 
This will be decisively for how the finance sector and the government split the losses together ", said Marek this week to the server iHNed.cz. 
Whether the plan is dismissed now or in the beginning of the next week, view is not decisive to Mareks. 
" It is much more importantly, that to itself the congressional representatives on it to some to support the plan and that they dismiss him as fast as possible. 
The psychological meaning of the arrangement about the fact that it comes for a discharge is the most important " at this moment, stressed Marek.
