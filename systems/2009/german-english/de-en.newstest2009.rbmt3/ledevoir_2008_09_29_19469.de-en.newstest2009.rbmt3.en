Discussion - From the blood that again became sure 
Yesterday Hema Quebec celebrated the 10-th anniversary of her foundation, and her president, Dr. Francine D�cary, had all reason to be glad, because Hema Quebec has become one of the most sure and most efficient blood banks of the world. 
And above all she has the trust of the general public wiedergewonnen which had hard been shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s. 
How one knows, were contaminated by the blood donations service of the Canadian red cross to administered national blood reserves during the 1980s with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus. 
In view of this drama and the discontent of the general public the government of Canada in February, 1994 initiated a public investigation escorted by the judge Horace Krever which had to the purpose to bring light in the circumstances which had led to a such tragedy and to work out guidelines to prevent a renewed disaster of this kind. 
While judge Krever still hesitated to deliver his report, at that time several provinces put a committee on the legs whose purpose was to develop a new system for the management of units of stored blood in Canada. 
In Quebec the committee G�lineau fulfilled this order. 
After the reports of G�lineau and Krever two blood banks were founded in Canada: To supply Hema Quebec which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, in order the other provinces and both territories. 
` In 1998, as Hema Quebec her work has taken up, 38% of the people barely had trust in the unit of stored blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. D�cary. 
The situation was disheartening. 
To improve by the huge strains to the security of the units of stored blood and by the work in this area during the following years, we have the trust of the general public won back, she says, before she stresses proudly that in the beginning of 2008 meanwhile nearly 94% of the population of Quebec trust had in Hema Quebec. 
Nevertheless, Dr. D�cary keeps in the consciousness that ` trust is something extremely breakable '. 
Since her foundation on the 28th September, 1998 Hema Quebec acts after the principle of the care. 
At this time we seen the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of the cattle insanity in Europe, a new kind Creutzfeldt Jakob-Krankheit, tells this woman who holds in 1998 the management since the foundation. 
` And we did not have the slightest notion whether this illness about the blood could be transferred. 
Thus we appealed at one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and G�lineau which applies exclusion measures according to one if one does not know this and if an illness progresses only slowly as it is obviously with Creutzfeldt Jakob-Krankheit the case which comments by a degeneration of the brain what leads without fail to the death. 
Thus one accepted in April, 1999 no blood of the persons who had stayed since 1980 longer than one month in the United Kingdom. 
Now, some years ago was proved without any doubt that this illness about the blood transfers. 
Thus this event has shown us that the principle of the care which we applied absolutely has a sense. 
In 1999 a lot of more precise technology appeared at the market to the recognition of HIV: The nucleic acid tests (NST) which enable to prove the occurence of the virus independently directly in the blood of the donator and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as it was the case with the tests used up to now. 
The NST enabled to shorten the incubation time which takes place between the time at which the person was infected and if the first viruses can be proved by our technologies in the blood, explains the specialist. 
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week. 
Thus became the risk that certain donators could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, reduces substantially. 
This improvement enabled, the risk to transfer AIDS about a blood transfusion to lower in substantial litre of beer. 
Nowadays one of 12 million persons runs the risk to receive infected blood with HIV. 
` In other words this is called that one would have to distribute 12 million units of stored blood, before somebody would be stuck on with HIV. 
Because Hema Quebec every year distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 units of stored blood, it would last more than 24 years, before a case appears, with the HIV about an unit of stored blood was transferred. 
I believe that, besides, one can feel fine nowadays if one gets a blood transfusion or prescribes to restore the health ', thinks the managerial boss of Hema Quebec. 
` Our challenge for the next ten years is to receive the security of our products. 
One never knows which illness cause can reach in the system. 
Only last year there has appeared on the island Reunion the Chikungunya virus which, just like the Westnil virus, by insects about the blood will transfer. 
We must supervise incessantly ', continues Dr. D�cary, before she stresses that, in addition, Hema Quebec must make available a sufficient care beside a sure care. 
` The need rises because the population grows old. 
Because the treatments are more aggressive to the cancer fight, the patients often need new red blood cells or platelets. 
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor's net to which on average only 3% of the inhabitants suitable to the blood donation of Quebec belong. ' 
Besides, can every healthy person who 18 years or is older and which fulfils suitability criteria, all 56 days, thus six times in the year, blood make a donation. 
On average 14% of the persons who make available her blood are not accepted because they have fallen ill, for instance, with AIDS or malaria, and who has traveled in a land in which malaria is spread, it is excluded for a year from the blood donation. 
` With these 3% we get to receive an inventory which corresponds to the needs of the hospitals. 
Lacking stocks are very rare. 
But one must renew the members of this donator's net if they can become older and donate no more blood. 
It is difficult to persuade the people, to donate blood, above all, however, to hold them and to bring them, to become regular donators. 
Nowadays the life is so hectic that one seldom finds the time to spend one hour with the blood donation ', regrets Francine D�cary. 
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars Hema Quebec delivers not only to units of stored blood, but also human fabrics, under it osseous grafts, heart flaps, eyeballs and skin which is used almost exclusively by heavy fire injuries. 
These fabrics are examined, worked on and frozen, before they are interstored with Hema Quebec which also administers the only public umbilical cord blood bank of Quebec. 
In the umbilical cord which was looked earlier than biomedical rubbish is in family cells rich blood which can serve to treat heavy illnesses, as for example leukaemia. 
` Some weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood test, and we plan to take thousand yearly more than. 
` We should probably begin in the beginning of the next year to make available it for transplants ', explains Dr. D�cary further who describes this program of the umbilical cord blood decrease as very much popularly. 
` Many mothers are persuaded to have no access to it ', because Hema Quebec lacks the means to offer this complicated and costly program in all hospitals of Quebec.
