Debate around bilingual education: Education in English-speaking surroundings 
In this issue of "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates to the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific employee in Kalifonischen studies and leading manager in the department of Educational sciences in the Pacific Research institute for Public Policy, is not a co-author of the book " virtually one thinks: Why the middle class needs a school choice ". 
To appeal to the B sharp-panic voters is a complex task. 
Barrack Obamas suggestions on the subject Education are a typical example of it. 
Obamas electoral campaign mentions to conclude successfully the likelyhood with afro American and B sharp-panic pupils the school ", is lower, than with white pupils " - what is right. 
To close this achievement distance, Obamas educational plan especially under the others recommends a bilingual transitional phase in the education for those which only learn English. 
The question to Obama still consists in the fact whether his application contradicts for the bilingual education which lays the main focus on lessons into other languages than English his interest to reduce the distance in the school achievements. 
If we take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles. 
The majority of the pupils are B sharp-panic and come from families with low income. 
More than a third of the pupils from which many are only recently in the land learn English. 
Astonishing 100 percent of pupils of the fourth class have still passed in 2008 the state check in math at a good level. 
Likewise unexpectedly 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were valued in the English check as good. 
This astonishing success was reached with other methods, than those which are preferred by Obama. 
School Sixth Street lays her main focus on examination and practise, on steady control of the knowledge and a posture which tolerates no exceptions. 
Besides the school carries out the beginning after which the education runs in English-speaking surroundings. Exactly this is the point which Obama should follow, according to the head mistress Linda Mikels. 
This beginning lays value on the almost exclusive use of the English language in the professional lessons. 
Mrs. Mikels who rejects the idea of bilingual education said to me, the school would have a noteworthy success with a pupil who had come only briefly before it from Mexico. 12 months later one would enter the classroom and can recognize him no more. 
" It functions ", she marked, " it functions for us ". 
Dignity Obama a school like "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with big interest in Latin-American and other English from learning pupils take? 
The achievements of the school would make easy the answer to this question, however, the educational positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time the idea of bilingual education) and his own logical support of the bilingual education do predictions about Obamas answer uncertainly. 
While he agrees to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently has the subject trivialisiert, while he marked that people should stop, itself worries about on " only English " aiming legislation do. 
Instead, he said: " You should make sure that your child can do Spanish ". 
If Obama wants to close the achievement distance really, he should take into consideration carefully educational models which function instead of despising them and to trivialisieren.
