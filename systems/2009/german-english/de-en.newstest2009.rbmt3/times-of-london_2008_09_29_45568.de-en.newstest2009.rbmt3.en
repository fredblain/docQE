Here with us in New York one speaks fluently Finanzlatein. 
At first sight nothing has changed. 
If tourists kept away in Manhattan from the newsstands and the immense television screens in the Times Square, they would not notice at all that they are in the middle of a debacle. 
They would never believe that over her heads, in the schuhschachtelartigen offices with the glass facades, bankers and Hedgefondverwalter which have the monopoly in New York have daily the worst horror work day since the stock market fall of 1929. 
The suppliers still push with loud rattles the metal Teew�gen along sidewalks and carry trays with muffin for the breakfast meetings are loaded. 
Latinos still shuffle between flatlets around like human pack animals load with around 50 ironed T-shirts which hang on a pole lying on her shoulders similar to yoke. 
Clerk still wait in himself on the sidewalks to considering food states for her Fr�hst�cksbagel and it is still to be got impossibly on a weekday between 16 and 19 o'clock a yellow taxi. 
It did not feel at all like a crisis, until I decided Thursday nachmittag on account of all end of the world gossip to open a new savings account. 
Although I had decided to lay my duty way timewise on the quiet late afternoon in my family branch JP Morgan Chase, quite about 20 people queue stood. 
Not to take off in the monetary counters around money or to deposit, but in the customer service-counter where regular customers checkbooks order, ask tourists for the way to department store Macy's and where new customers open accounts. 
Most before me, so I learned later from Stiffly, my " personal bank employee with license ", stood for same reason like I queue. 
in contrast to me, nevertheless, they had already removed her savings of smaller banks, at places from where they oscillated, as well as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Iceland. 
They had removed money of so-called Thrifts (a little of a building society resembling), loan banks and those local savings banks which have branches only in a state and say that them her customers like family treat. 
Last year 15 these banks are quiet and have gone quiet bankruptcy. 
During the last pair of days Washington Mutual went over, a bank with arrangements at the rate of 327 $ billions, in bankruptcy management and when letzen Friday inhabitant of New York about the week-end home drove, Wachovia, an other bank which owns savings arrangements to the value of 440 $ billions was in search of a saving buyer. 
In the fear of an other collapse, the office and store employees brought before me were waiting her cash to a bank as a sure harbour is looked, a bank for most rescue takeovers in the embankment Street is responsible. 
Quite normal inhabitants of New York have appropriated fluent Finanzlatein during the last weeks. 
A woman who called up in my Chinese family supermarket took with so much closeness from relation on Lehman Brothers, the bankruptcy gone bank and their emaciatedly looking chairman of the board Dick Fuld as if she blasphemed a decayed colleague. 
And Lyn, around the 50-year-old uniformed Concierge of my residential block has left our usual entertainment subjects about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery. 
" Now I have all my savings in monetary market fund " she told to me after my visit at the bank. 
" I have changed, I enter no more Risko. "
