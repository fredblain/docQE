` I receive the master behind the stage to hold on his character ', G�nter Brauer, photographer. 
No sales, no frill, no costumes for the appearance. 
The nature of the big flamenco dancers who renounce the concentration and devote themselves to the interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man. 
On the one hand artist 
On the other hand, personality 
I look in private life, at these moments which are foreign for the audience, I know, when I can find typical gesture, the depth of a stolen look or Ausdr�ckst�rke of the hands which are procured because they are not entered the stage for the personality. 
In his project 'Flamenco-people' German photographer G�nter Bauer shows rich in change histrionics of some stagings on the stage with singer, dancer and guitarists. He was known by this side for the artists still a little. 
With this suggestion the photographer creates a special Ikonografie of the flamenco representation at different levels. 
The exhibit which belongs to the program of the month of the photograph of the flamenco ` reflects the international importance of flamenco which becomes bigger and bigger from the day day, ', explains the artist and makes clear that 'Flamenco-people' ` can be every any person, but if one looks the photos, the viewer notices that these are no typical pictures of artist on the stage. 
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists, they are able on the stage passion to provide sadness, joy and to move with it the audience. 
To be able to hold on the personality of these artists, one must do no photos on the stage. 
Their personality and her character is in her hearts. 
What was interested me to create a personal atmosphere which would enable to me to hold on the characters of the biggest flamenco masters with the photo camera '. 
Farmer, inspired by the festival ` Cante de read Minas', came along in 1997 on a long trip to take a photo of singer, of Gitaristen or dancer with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the Bildsortierungsfunktion of the camera and the available material, originated the pictures which remind of classical photograph. 
The application of different stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the picture by which to the picture the modernity and the idea, as the farmer understands flamenco, are lent: ` The music with traditional roots which changes and surprises every day '. 
This is not only the dance, the song or the instrumental play in themselves, but the personality of the artist, his character which entices the audience with his art. 
The search for the essentials, after certain something which becomes visible in form of the hearing, the being is and was the steady purpose of this work which is presented in the next time in the gallery of the El Fot�mata. 
Known personalities in flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and other belong for the narrow choice of nearly seventy artists who were photographed. 
The project became an anthology of the flamenco and will soon appear book, with all portraits from the exhibit. 
Farmer's passion to the portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago once more and to realize as ` portraits of the veterans of the Sports' (` of SportARTproject'). 
Although the drafts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives ` to it like me very much to take a photo of the people, to get to know them and to move me into their life state, it is for a short moment or a longer time. 
I think that in the area of the photograph the portrait is the most difficult type. 
You meet or bump into persons, personalities whom you sometimes do not know at all, or they leave you for a pair of minutes alone to be able to do a photo. 
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I try to realize always my ideas. ' 
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco from today with the title 'Flamenco-people' is issued in the gallery of the El Fot�mata which is in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and runs in parallel with street la Alameda de H�rcules. You can visit the exhibit up to the 16th October.
