<seg id="1"> Duel at Razor's Edge: MP3 player against mobile phones. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> We advise you on your election </seg>
<seg id="3"> While nearly every cell phone to play MP3 files, it can not yet a MP3 player phone. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Therefore, it naturally is that it is better just to buy a phone. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Despite everything, there are plenty of reasons why a player should be independent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The choice depends on the type of use and the demands from the future owner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Certainly it is difficult to buy at home for a great expensive turntables, pointed to the latest album by Maxim Turbulence listen to. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Once such musical innovations appear not to LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, you have LPs with type rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream about at least one such. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So it's with the music to travel, so with compressed music, spoken - music in MP3 format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Even here there are price and quality categories. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For one, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player spend eight thousand crowns, but is also Pink Floyd fan probably hardly headphones for twenty crowns from the market cope. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Two extremes, between which there enough room for everyone there. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The selection is broad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Even the battery life is crucial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some good music player can be much more than just play music, but what can mobile phones, they do not even implicitly,. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern equipment is only as universal as the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition to the primary functions, the phone calls and the cornices, it may be music and videos play, both record, it has a better times, times a worse camera and can perhaps also navigate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And if you have the smartphones and communicators inclusive, you have almost a small computer in your pocket. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can broil and no TV pictures. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the universality of mobile phones also bring disadvantages. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will however need to reload. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the playing of music is one of the biggest energy eaters. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Few phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours to play, mostly, it is much less. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) is significantly more powerful. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Therefore, you should at the cheap phones reckon that they can not be longer than a few hours of music can play. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you then and still on the phone, buy you still prefer security to a charger for the office - even for more expensive equipment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> For MP3 players, you will not have this problem, including the less good hold at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a time of recharging. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Another problem exists when the music on the mobile wants to play. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately, only a small portion of the device via a USB conclusion, it is also not every cell phone without special software directly to a PC. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Of course you can the music directly to a memory play about, but few card readers without reduction with the tiny memory card ready to be used in mobile phones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> For players, you need to exceptions (iPod) no special software. </seg>
<seg id="33"> You only need the device via USB port with music from your PC to feed. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Most mobile phones and players put themselves in a music library, arranged by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the assessment by users. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some devices are only the tree from the address list, similar to the Windows Explorer, and some can be both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> When selecting a specific device, you should especially after the lifespan of the battery, the capacity, quality and type of sound and of course the ease of check. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Your music is mainly scenery and you hear it every day just for example, in the tram, then extends to any mobile phone that plays MP3 files. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What really almost any cell phone can be. </seg>
<seg id="40"> You must also not control what music formats a mobile phone or any player can handle. </seg>
<seg id="41"> MP3 create all, and most of the music you get is precisely in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format is one of the most widespread and, moreover, most devices also music in WMA format play. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Better phones also allow the purchase of music online. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It takes only about the mobile Internet pages of a provider (or another provider) will suffice, and you can a song or album. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This service may already in itself a striking argument why we put on a music phone should be. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately, the range of providers and bad only limited mostly to rapid radio hits. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The prices are not the lowest. </seg>
<seg id="49"> But generally it is believed that this kind of selling music (be it on GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in the future the music industry will dominate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> The cell phone, the most for himself. </seg>
<seg id="51"> If you want to listen to something, you after the phone in your pocket, while the player is forgotten at home. </seg>
<seg id="52"> It is, however, indicate whether you are at least a headset or a wireless handsfree for them. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If not, you can use the integrated speakers rely on almost any mobile phone features, but only a few MP3 players. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Probably the biggest advantage of mobile music is for many in the price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand crowns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> For three and four thousand crowns you already have a very decent Walkman. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The biggest handicap for most of that, no normal headphones are involved. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5-mm-opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The advantage of the player is again in light of the operation. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see Selection) - Players can really serve everyone. </seg>
<seg id="61"> A minimum of functions, the similarity in the operation with the normal sooner or cassette recorders, for example, the turntable is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="62"> It threatens no collision in the form of an employee mistakenly mobile Internet, and then a horrendous bill for data transfers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> After what device you should now draw </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> Even the cheapest phones (eg Vodafone 527) are usually on a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="65"> Even if you are a card after purchase, ranging from two thousand crowns. </seg>
<seg id="66"> But consideration. </seg>
<seg id="67"> For the base models are usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB supported. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the most expensive may also 8-GB card read. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> If you already have a mobile phone and is still an inexpensive MP3 player want to buy, then take you to Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, iRiver or Emgeton. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Depending on the capacity (up to 2 GB), you must then not more than 1100 crowns on the table. </seg>
<seg id="71"> They belong to the more sophisticated listeners, you prefer to specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). </seg>
<seg id="72"> These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the ease it comes to a single MP3 player approached. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Most is Sony Ericsson, its mobile phones from the Walkman series of the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players. </seg>
<seg id="74"> The same services at the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) make you MP3 player manufacturers of the above . </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first virtual providers already this year after the Czech Republic. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Maybe </seg>
<seg id="3"> The mobile market in the Czech Republic is fairly mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they also by their counterparts in Western Europe are offered. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Yet something is missing here - a virtual providers, the traditional forces to lower prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Maybe it will not be long in coming. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> That the Czech mobile provider to the most expensive in Europe at work, we have often reported on Mobil.cz. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This also confirmed the Telecommunications Authority CTU, the attention made that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the final steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges is likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators will SMS from abroad cheaper than at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> How is it that the prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe are so high? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is simple, it's missing the competition, which really makes a challenge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Maybe it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of more than 100%. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The mobile provider rant on the other hand, likes the fact that it is on the Czech market very much competition. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The shares are often also the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (CTU), Pavel Dvorak, when, in the past had often expressed that there is no place in the Czech Republic for another supplier admit. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is likely that a classic provider with its own network no longer has very many opportunities (Incidentally, he would probably barely find frequencies). </seg>
<seg id="15"> But there is still a possibility - a virtual manufacturer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Especially the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market saw a significant price reduction with him, then also on the traditional mobile service provider had to react. </seg>
<seg id="17"> There were even before the entry of such companies such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain as similar votes in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It has however shown that there is space for such providers and that they really can be successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Incidentally, one need not long after to find examples. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In February of this we have on the launch of the virtual mobile operator in Poland, King reported. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In just half a year, this supplier, more than 100 thousand customers to win and so on the fifth of the country aufzusteigen providers. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Mobil King stands behind the financial group Penta, in the Czech Republic, inter alia, U: fon owns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The advantage consists of virtual providers is that you're on a much more specific audience can concentrate. </seg>
<seg id="24"> To function effectively, you need virtual service providers to give customers much less than a classic manufacturer. </seg>
<seg id="25"> You do not need relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the world profile as the virtual providers usually as a low-cost firms out - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, but often from a less extensive service offering is accompanied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile SMS in Britain at least half cheaper than its competitors. </seg>
<seg id="28"> However, as the example of Mobil King in Poland shows it may also be a good move, to a non-stereotyped target set. </seg>
<seg id="29"> These providers is directed specifically at men. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Real men choose Mobil King - the providers, they like and they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Hard to say whether a similar approach as in Poland and the Czech Republic could gain a foothold. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Any doubt of the Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is a market segment, on which most virtual operators are based, relatively small. </seg>
<seg id="33"> He is also from the viewpoint of the services offered relatively saturated. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In the Czech Republic a chance, my mobile provider </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile service provider Czech Republic conquered, this is not King will be mobile. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic to see the negotiations not very hopeful from. </seg>
<seg id="37"> It is befitting a king of mobile market in other countries of our region ", says in a telephone interview for Jana Mobil.cz Studničková, Spokesperson of the financial group Penta. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Indirectly confirmed it so that the current mobile provider in the Czech Republic this idea does not subscribe. </seg>
<seg id="39"> On the contrary, they try everything to do with the fact that no potential competitor arises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Your interest in starting a virtual mobile provider showed a long time since the group GTS Novera, a further step the company wants to create a real competitor to Telefonica O2 in the corporate sector to be. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "We have a great interest to our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And the sooner the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> About this possibility we have repeated with all Czech mobile operators negotiated. </seg>
<seg id="44"> With some of them we could already negotiating progress, "said the spokesman of the group Pavel Kaidl. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Perhaps now better times. </seg>
<seg id="46"> From unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider, perhaps by the end of the year is unlikely. </seg>
<seg id="47"> So far, but this is from an insurmountable wall of silence surrounded. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "In this moment we do not assume that in the Czech Republic Square for a full-fledged virtual manufacturer exists. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market is large compared to other markets on specifics. </seg>
<seg id="50"> So far, we have no subject with a complex and serious project in this area addressed, "says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefonica O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> On the specifics of the Czech market also other suppliers out. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The press spokeswoman for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds rare in accordance with the Declaration of O2 added: "So far we have not yet viable on both sides and beneficial project found, at which one could build further." </seg>
<seg id="53"> And she adds: "In the network of T-Mobile until the end of the year, hardly a provider of virtual history. </seg>
<seg id="54"> At this moment we already have a concrete offer have available, so as to be able to think short term. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone directed its attention more on the fulfillment of the requirements of its own 3G license. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> We consider this just from the perspective of customers as the best. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile Internet. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The responsible authorities - with suppliers hand in hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The approach of the mobile provider is easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, this would result in lower prices and thereby also to a decline in profits. </seg>
<seg id="61"> So why such a facilitate the entry of competitors? </seg>
<seg id="62"> That the manufacturer to pull it if it goes to something also evident from the long back and forth to the emergence of U: fon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of CTU went to the time when U: fon on the market came from the company from T-Mobile. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The show also publicly available information from the CTU's websites. </seg>
<seg id="65"> But now is precisely U: fon as an argument why a virtual providers should not allow. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Kemrová Martina said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further exacerbated by the entry of a fourth mobile provider strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic is obvious that a new player in the market itself, and especially its services would put heavy demands. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Given this approach of the mobile provider puzzled, however, the absolute Disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities. </seg>
<seg id="69"> It is not just about the attitude of the CTU, the Czech unfortunately - in contrast to Britain and other highly developed countries - has not the competence in economic competition to intervene. </seg>
<seg id="70"> This has solely by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS). </seg>
<seg id="71"> But this was about this issue throughout his typical attitude. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> "The entry of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible once there is a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual vendor on renting the necessary infrastructure has come. </seg>
<seg id="73"> So far, no such agreement, because the offer was probably interested potential for the traditional providers are not sufficiently interesting, "said in his reply to our request Kristian Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> By representatives of providers such a formulation would not be surprised. </seg>
<seg id="75"> From a public authority, which represented the interests of consumers and others should make sure that nobody's position on the market abuse, this is more than questionable. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual operators are working quite normal, it is observed that their entry to a reduction in mobile phone services has contributed." </seg>
<seg id="77"> But probably belong to the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price not to the interests of the ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> Really shocking about this case is almost touching the line of the three mobile service providers, of their responses follows. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Just as the very same gasoline at the pump certainly only a coincidence and the result of a fight is tough competition. </seg>
<seg id="81"> "The authority in this case discovered no evidence that an anti-competitive behavior directed suggest, and therefore it has no reason to any kind in the matter. </seg>
<seg id="82"> None of the supplier has a dominant market position, so he also has not increased the responsibility for his actions on the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The necessary tools for opening up the market for mobile virtual operators are missing probably also the regulator for telecommunications, "said Chalupa, in its declaration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious points. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets, prepared by the CTU, after the telecommunications from the perspective of economic competition is a single market. </seg>
<seg id="86"> In such a market, then of course none of the Czech mobile provider a dominant position. </seg>
<seg id="87"> But some legal experts offer a different perspective - for the entry of a virtual provider is always the consent of the operator is required. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And the mobile provider has - logically - for his network's monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="89"> Which means that he is in a certain segment necessarily a dominant position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Even if you but with this argument is not mitgeht, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three mobile service providers strikingly similar way. </seg>
<seg id="91"> These complaints show a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera), that they are in negotiations with all suppliers in a very similar obstacles. </seg>
<seg id="92"> The shifting of responsibility to the CTU is in the telecommunications services is a fairly usual trick with which the ÚOHS from the whole affair distances. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> This was already in some similar cases to observe. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately, it did not succeed in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act extending the powers of the CTU to the field of economic competition in the telecommunications enforce, although a number of professionals including an improvement in the situation had promised. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The representatives must ÚOHS know only too well, but they probably have other interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It is already, if nobody look </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> Ignored once the functioning of any pseudovirtueller suppliers from which it is in the Czech mobile networks are more equal. </seg>
<seg id="98"> There are companies that own price lists for mobile telecommunications services spending, but only partly public. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Normally it is namely to firms involved in multi-level marketing act. </seg>
<seg id="100"> My mobile phone services, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Star Life and others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The price of these companies usually only get to elect. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The joke of the matter is that the firm towards the operator as a classical corporate client occurs, a large quantity of SIM cards ordered. </seg>
<seg id="103"> As an important customer receives it then special price offers (and other offers). </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile provider a similar kind of resale ban. </seg>
<seg id="105"> "Should there be cases that you describe, then it is a breach of contractual conditions act with which we will employ, resulting in a termination of cooperation with the relevant society can lead," Martina replied to our question Kemrová about this issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing when the leaders of the mobile provider not herumspricht. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies can take thousands of clients. </seg>
<seg id="108"> No operator is opposed to such an approach, however. </seg>
<seg id="109"> From the activities of these companies that they are not negligible gains, while they - in contrast to the actual virtual providers - not by the actual official marketing impaired. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> To potential problems makes Miroslav Čepický attention: "The law allows such kind of speculation, despite all the services of these companies only by a very small percentage of customers. </seg>
<seg id="111"> They must also accept that the SIM card in your phone does not run on their behalf, they can not fully have about how the ordinary customers of mobile service providers. " </seg>
<seg id="112"> Alone, but the CTU should occur at least strange. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> In addition opens up another question for the ÚOHS. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Sealing the mobile service providers such an approach before their eyes, why they lock themselves against a virtual provider? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It should be added that the ÚOHS to detect such activities fairly strong powers, and if it does not want, it does not interfere with the Declaration of the providers, they knew nothing about it and its terms and conditions that would prohibit satisfied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive is </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> As the text has already been stressed repeatedly brought the entry of virtual operators a significant price decline for the various services themselves. </seg>
<seg id="118"> They have practically in all countries where virtual operators have emerged, the traditional provider tries, whose emergence of virtually more or less to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="119"> The arguments used by them were virtually identical - a too small or too much saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> In highly developed countries but accessed precisely in those moments regulatory bodies, which can not protect the interests of mobile service providers, but those of their customers tried to maintain. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Whether through formal or non-action pressure, they reached that the first virtual operators emerged, and this was followed by others. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately throw the Czech regulatory bodies throughout the case like a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Based on our experience, we can not discard the impression that ambiguity in the competencies in these cases is more than favorable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> But let us not into the shotgun grain. </seg>
<seg id="125"> When the background information is correct, and soon a virtual provider arises, will the Czech mobile market may soon set in motion. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If a provider the emergence of a virtual mobile service provider allows, the ÚOHS not remain idle when it comes to other interested parties refuse (to discriminate). </seg>
<seg id="127"> And the Czechs are then finally no more expensive phone than the rest of Europe. </seg>

<seg id="20"> Buses are divided into city buses, where there is standing there and the maximum speed is limited public transport buses with standing and a higher permitted speed and long distance buses without standing with the maximum speed and seats, with seat belts equipped. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="21"> As in the plane, says expert </seg>

<p>
<seg id="22"> The BESIP for road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín sees the movement of the stewards on board a bus not a fundamental problem. </seg>

<seg id="4"> WestLB would be a "competence bloc" with sustainable earnings power in such a business. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And on such a connection is the decisive impetus to other lung Bünde in the Landesbank sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> To read it, if an executive at a difficult time to demonstrate ability to act. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Because the ailing WestLB is still under enormous pressure. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only from the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, the North Rhine-Westphalia state government recently has made clear that the time short, a future solution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> As always, by a kind of liaison between the Deka-Bank, the savings for their customers know Investment Fund, and WestLB is, however, been some time since the speech - also on the Frankfurt side. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although Deka-Bank chief Franz Waas in the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August know, in a merger of the house at the Mainzer Landstrasse with a Landesbank, or approximately Helaba WestLB, he can see no sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, the Board of Deka, each half of the country's banks and savings associations is taken, the board instructed, with WestLB talks on joint activities to lead. </seg>
<seg id="12"> This might be the capital markets business or parts of it go. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The talks have admittedly, it is said the financial center, has only just begun. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> From the Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees on the major employers in the financial center of Frankfurt counts is not the first time the speech, when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector. </seg>
<seg id="15"> 2003, for a moment, it seems as could Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba merge. </seg>
<seg id="16"> For this tripartite covenant, however, was nothing. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No sooner were the plans became public, said the Hesse state government against a participation of Helaba them. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The other two houses were then not each other. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But there have always been mind-games on a combination of the Deka-Bank country where banks. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Recently, however, had Günther Merl, Chairman of Helaba, games against plan on a merger with pronounced his house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Regardless of which seems to mature recognition that a combination of the various houses backing of the public service sector need doing. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Now that the state of Bavaria has passed, it could be the first to connect BayernLB with Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg closer. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For Helaba is not necessarily good news. </seg>
<seg id="25"> If the pressure for further mergers increase, going after her and after the partners in favor. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the south they would nurmehr junior partner, although the financial crisis so far has durchstanden much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A merger with West LB in turn, the Savings Bank and Giro Association Hesse-Thuringia, with 85 percent of Helaba is involved, the beginning of the year put an end to. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Such geostrategic considerations are only one side. </seg>
<seg id="30"> On the other is about the question of how the different business models of individual houses fit. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In June, said Merl, the crucial question of what business the future viability of the country's banks should be ensured, either by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association have not been answered. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The German banking system was relatively stable, said federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck only in the past week. </seg>
<seg id="3"> How well that the politicians the word "relatively" used and even einflocht that the German banking sector developments of the crisis will not be spared. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Because the weekend is now occurred. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Dax in Munich quoted real estate financiers, Hypo Real Estate (HRE) is a consortium of German banks billion loan to itself from the turbulence in the markets abzuschirmen. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A person familiar the situation told Reuters on Monday, the credit support amounted to up to 35 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Hypo Real Estate should only pay interest on the part that they also qualify. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The money come from both private and public banks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Background losses at the subsidiary Depfa. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The state had financiers, according to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money, refinanced extremely short notice - which because of distrust in the markets now is no longer possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the first half of 2008 was the cash reserve of the Bank by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros shrunk, the equity ratio had slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent relented. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The current income and net income from financial transactions were compared with the same period last year dropped to zero, the proceeds from additions to certain assets and securities as well as from the release of provisions for loan losses by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Only thanks to higher income from refunds of downstream transfer costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the repayment of interest after the tax code and the management of group companies, had revenue of around minus 16 percent can still be modest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The formerly state financiers had after its privatization in 1990, initially with commercial real estate loans verspekuliert, then in Aareal Bank had been outsourced. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Because we in the classical state funding earned too little, the Depfa then reinforced in infrastructure projects and the funding of community projects by private investors and the government committed (Public-Private Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> On the value of the subsidiary Hypo Real Estate write-offs now make a "substantial material" effect on the profit and loss account of the group will have hot it is quite vague. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The fact is that the dividend has been deleted. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Already in 2007 it was reduced by two-thirds were. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Hypo Real Estate is Depfa since the takeover a major state and infrastructure financiers. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is stronger than other institutions from lending in the interbank market, since it has no customer deposits. </seg>
<seg id="21"> With the collapse of American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago is among the lending banks again versiegt largely because the banks are hoarding liquidity. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a portion - about 50 billion euros - Depfa of the loan to refinance short-term funds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Upon notification of Hypo Real Estate, is the financing needs of the group with the credit for the foreseeable future and the company met "by the influence of the currently largely funktionsunfähigen international money markets" screened. </seg>
<seg id="24"> From other sources is to hear that, thanks to the refinancing of the funds until the end of 2009 was secured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The HRE chairman Georg Funke said, but that the Hypo Real Estate Group the money markets for the foreseeable future will no longer qualify for them. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Bundesbank and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the marketability of Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> That stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank hoped. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But given the dynamism and unpredictability of the crisis there is no certainty. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not even inconceivable that the financing is not fully utilized to be. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But the opposite is not auszuschleißen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> After late on Sunday evening rumor the bank before the insolvency, can also at least temporary rescue the minds not to calm down. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The share price breaks by 75 percent to 3.30 euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Pretty good hold, however, the bond rates. </seg>
<seg id="34"> During the primary debt barely moves show, the prices of subordinated bonds after clearer. </seg>
<seg id="35"> It affects mainly the bonds of the former subsidiary Hypo Wuerttemberg and understandably have maturities beyond 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Seem Hypo Real Estate bonds formerly a speculative investment alternative, then their value following the sharp aggravation of the banking crisis and the institute itself, with the acquisition of Depfa until the crisis had brought to the house than the stability of the international financial system to be dependent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> As long as the banks, governments and less depressed commercial banks to support the system ready yet, as long as may be extended by the timely repayment of pensions to be. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Or it occurs that, which is currently hardly anyone dares to hope - that the financial crisis in the coming 15 months is overcome. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> But given the deal with the partial nationalization overturning the messages is from the safety of probability bordering currently only has become a legitimate hope. </seg>

<seg id="6"> I was excited. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Even before school, I had Bammel. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in Kawasaki and leaving 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The way I had to find alone, fortunately, I have not lost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The lessons start at Tachibana seems not so strictly defined as at our home in Lower Saxony. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The pupils from the age of eight spin clock, until eight forty to a brief round meeting with the teacher begins, the 'home room'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> But before the lesson began, I was in the series, introduce myself. </seg>
<seg id="13"> I am not the guy who likes to speak before the people, even before a class of 40 students. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because I still had no school uniform, I have an old rock my host mother dressed, this blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In this elevator I was before the lectern and tried everything right out: 'Where she Sayonara Sylvana ...' - My name is Sylvana, come from Germany and had birthday in a week. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the moment, I was very glad that I had a good two years before starting had to learn the language. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The 31 girls in the class have all getuschelt, gekichert and gewunken and I constantly have the word "Kawaii" belongs. </seg>
<seg id="18"> That I already knew from my manga. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It belongs to überlebenswichtigen vocabulary of Japanese girls and means' cute, sweet '. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Then I quickly to my place gehuscht. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The girl next to me has pretty broad gegrinst, they thought it was an honor that the exchange student should sit beside her. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The rest of the day was fairly quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was downright assails. </seg>
<seg id="23"> All spoke up and asked me kicherten and holes in the abdomen - it is really difficult to understand Japanese to English. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the break then grabbed all of their Bentos. </seg>
<seg id="25"> My host mother had me as a Lunchbox made - that is something other than the desolate German break bread. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumber and seaweed, fruit and meat in a kind Tofumantel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Mostly, I have no foggiest exactly what I eat here in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The odd things to see and taste completely novel. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is clear that everything is really tasty. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Well, up to the salty preserved plums, perhaps, brrrr! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Bentos at Japanese schools are not just lunch. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It sometimes requires that a girl a boy a self-prepared bento gift, which they then herrichtet particularly artful - in the hope that the boys at the snack closer to learn. </seg>
<seg id="33"> I like this in my manga comics to read. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Even rats have feelings </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A rat or a cockroach flees when danger is that it also feels fear? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced, too many animals have feelings. </seg>
<seg id="4"> But how could we check whether they feel the same if they are similar to how we behave? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Internet magazine "Edge" have been used for several years, contributions of famous scientists published. </seg>
<seg id="6"> SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected in a series of answers to the question "What do you think are true, prove it without them?" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> I believe that animals sensations and other states of consciousness, without that I or anyone else that could yet prove where we can not even prove that other people have consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But in this case, at least we hope, because all human brains same basic configuration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But when we turn to other species and issues of feeling or, more generally, of consciousness touch, we enter the roughest terrain, because the hardware does not match. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> When a rat in danger, she is doing the same as many other animals: it is dead, escapes or attacks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> People behave similarly, leading some scientists to a similar close subjective experience. </seg>
<seg id="12"> I think it does not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult, our subjective experience of animals to be transferred. </seg>
<seg id="14"> On the one almost always conclude with the human consciousness associated circuitry the lateral prefrontal cortex one (because of his involvement in the short-term memory and the execution / control functions). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This broad region in humans is much higher than in the other primates and other creatures seem to be missing entirely. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At least for those aspects of our consciousness, the prefrontal cortex depend, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, therefore consists reason to believe that the man even from the other primates differs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Another dramatic feature is expected in the linguistic nature of humans is: Because such a large part of his experience with language, are often the consciousness depends on it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this case, one could exclude animals. </seg>
<seg id="19"> But even if not consciousness of language abhinge, this would certainly affect it so that animal consciousness, as might be set up, probably very different from most of our states of consciousness differences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness in other animals look like. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If it is, as something internal and subjective, yet neither measure because of the specific hardware, using our own experience, analyze it, it makes us his research with great problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Most of my remarks refer to the contents of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, science should be easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> One could sense the processes of animals without regard to their contents examined, and that is exactly what happens in studies of the short-term memory of primates, in particular the example of visualization. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But in this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick went after, we moved more on the neural correlates of consciousness as to the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical or not. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the Formation of visualization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> What is now responsible for the sensations? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I'll do it due to the fact that an emotional system such as the fear in one of his own conscious brain activity is activated. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What we call "fear" described, is the mental state in which we find ourselves, if the activity of the brain localized defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) memory occupied. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Seen sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex bound, the primates, and especially the people excel. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Linked to the linguistic nature are subtle gradations of feeling, because we are using the words and grammar states can differentiate and categorize, in addition to ourselves and others attributed. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> In this edition of the "Education Watch" discuss Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi, the positions of the candidates for bilingual education. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Lance T. Izumi, senior research associate in Kalifonischen studies and executive director in the Department of Education Studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Hispanic voters to be addressed is a complicated task. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Obama's campaign noted that "the probability of Afro-American and Hispanic students to school successfully, is lower than for white students" - what is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="7"> To this performance gap to close, we recommend Obama's education plan, especially among others a transition phase in bilingual education for those who learn English only. </seg>
<seg id="8"> However, there is a question for Obama is whether its use for bilingual education, focusing on education in languages other than English sets, contrary to his interest, the gap in the school to reduce benefits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Take for example "Sixth Street Prep," a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The majority of students are Hispanic and come from families with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country to learn English. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Nevertheless, in 2008 astonishing 100 percent of fourth grade students the state test in math at a good level existed. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school in the English test than good. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This amazing success was achieved by other methods than those which are favored Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The school Sixth Street presents its emphasis on reviewing and exercise, to steady control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In addition, the school practiced the approach, after training in an English-speaking environment runs. This is precisely the point that Obama should be noted, says the head teacher Linda Mikel. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in specialized classes. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Ms. Mikel, the idea of bilingual education declines, said to me, the school would have been a remarkable success with a student who only shortly before had come from Mexico. 12 months later, you would enter the classroom and it no longer can recognize. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "It works," she remarked that "it works for us." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Obama would be a school such as the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other students are learning English? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The benefits of the school would be the answer to this question lightly, but the educational policy positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time the idea of bilingual education) and its consistent support for bilingual education to make predictions about Obama's uncertain response. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivializes the issue, he remarked that people should cease to worry about the "English only" legislation aiming to make. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Instead, he said: "They should make sure that your child may be Spanish." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If Obama the performance gap really want to close, he should carefully consider educational models that work, rather than despise and to trivialize. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The pride and the strains in the life of the black population in a city very special </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hidden between the excesses of the theme parks around Orlando, a few miles from the flashy, loud and gigantic driving away, is a quiet town where the pride and the complications of African-American culture come to light. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurstons is no longer so easy to describe Hurston as it did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no jail. " </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nowadays it is a place of pilgrimage. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville came to the famous author of the Harlem Renaissance to remember. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And still is and remains the city which she describes - and made it a tourist excursion made by them in the Florida Travel Guide started to periods of depression by the Federal Writers Project was produced - in many ways a place of very special variety. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Eatonville is so independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida are often refused, their true thoughts with the white man to share the "so little about us knows that he does not know what escapes him. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Even today, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama, an open conversation about race relations calls, there are many here still tired of outsiders to be observed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "We are very anxious how our story is," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the town and municipality member of the oldest church in the city. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It must be right. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Eatonville was a long time as a paradox of triumph and the fight defined. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is both a historic example of the black movement as well as a community of nearly 2,400 residents, where the poverty rate twice the national average. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is both a stronghold of literature and an example of - and sometimes convicted, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, its roots in American slavery has. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is not surprising that residents here both proud and are on the alert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And thus began the reservations right to Eatonville's image with Zora actually, as everyone here Hurston call. </seg>
<seg id="16"> They presented the world their home town in books, which came from the heart and were written in dialect, as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1973) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Five paragraphs in the Florida Guides changed the city, near the Route 77 is a road through the often-forgotten center of Florida leads to the scenes of black history and human drama. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Naughty as Oskar, both in real life as well as in literature, led Hurston readers to the store's first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clark, and then turned to private affairs. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Off the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-angestrichene white modern school, with their manicured gardens and playgrounds, around which always takes care of Howard Miller, although he barely can read and write." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> They also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and Glenn Lee wrote that "any kind of drinks sold and also what-ever-fit bedrooms to hours." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In just a few hundred words brought Hurston So Eatonville with self-government, in conjunction, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This was certainly not a guide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In fact, this was not a portrait, which was appreciated by all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> "Zora describing things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized by the men cited, the songs about the beauty of their singing, which were full of sexual innuendo. </seg>
<seg id="25"> She added: "Some people do not want this." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> One remembers here is still to Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida, was withdrawn. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston in the city gebraust came, they usually did without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and wearing trousers in a city which even today is something on their clothing style venerable einbildet. </seg>
<seg id="28"> According to Mr Franklin was the most fascinating inhabitants, whereas many of them despised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "People were always glad to see Zora," said Mr Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But "they never stayed too long," he added while he rocks in his chair, on a terrace located to the rear, which overlooks the lake Sabelia in which Hurston in all likelihood was baptized. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and their books out of print. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Together with the bulk of the world Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although it was once a famous author was a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived in an anonymous grave buried. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In Eatonville, there were no big memorial ceremony, no public readings in great style. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "I do not think they have their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least understood," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston was published in 2003. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The turning point came in the 80s. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige highway through town, in order to the Kennedy Boulevard to replace the slow pace of the two main community. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Orlando suburbs had already Highway 4 through the western outskirts pushed. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The proposal was submitted as Eatonville is still a difficult period in its history recovered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Forced integration, among others, had the relatively idyllic isolation of the community to an end. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In the'50s brought the struggle against racial mixing hatred in the community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "In this period was often a bunch of white boys and they threw oranges and stuff on the outside sedentary people," said Mr. Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="43"> "There was even once assisted a woman was killed. </seg>
<seg id="44"> They threw a water melon from the car. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Hurston questioned in 1955 in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the request of the Supreme Court to force integration by its decision in the Brown case against the school as "insulting my race instead of respecting known. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Nowadays, residents say that although the abolition of racial segregation in some ways positive, they are the group cohesion in Eatonville and self-consciousness of his young weakened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> "Black children were accustomed to it, hugging to be - I remember - you hugged his teacher in the morning and you hugged his teacher in the evening," said NY Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group to protect the Eatonville Community . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> That was so long be maintained, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "We hugged his white teachers not because he was a white teacher - I think there is a cultural divide exists," said Mrs Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> However, the civil rights helped to make space for further Zora Neale Hurstons was created - black writers, actors and artists who have sat across prejudices, as it did, with a positive self-esteem and statements such as: "How can anyone Joy I refuse to society! </seg>
<seg id="51"> I do not understand it. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In 1975 the writer made himself Alice Walker on the way to Hurstons unnamed grave and began to revive her fame to fight. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Five years later was a much-praised biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway in the bookshelves to find, and she again become a part of the American literary canon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> The highway project came precisely at a time in which Eatonville famous daughter again in the light of the public stood. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And this time Hurstons old neighbors saw it as a savior. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> The community began in 1988 with planning a Hurston Festival to show what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many return every January for the celebration back. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> Some years later turned to the district from its road construction plans. </seg>
<seg id="59"> "The plans of a busy highway fünfspurigen the city accelerated the whole thing with top speed, aroused genuine pride citizens," said Mrs Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Ms. Boyd put it a little easier out: "Zora rescued Eatonville." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> The victory against the highway project has led to a change in the self-image of the town. </seg>
<seg id="62"> It came more and more arrived, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who since 1993 here in the church, and locals started the past to re-estimate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Eatonville was established in 1998 in the historic nation-wide register. </seg>
<seg id="64"> A new single library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 at the neugepflasterten embellished and Kennedy Boulevard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> Today, Eatonville remains a peculiarity in Florida just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when only 27 black families in the 1880ern was founded. </seg>
<seg id="66"> (She is now 90% black.) </seg>
<seg id="67"> Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> For most interviews is a necessary permit in advance and some things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, by a painted white and black men in the field work - may not be photographed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a penchant for dark, still fear that their community shielded misunderstood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> And yet, at the same time the larger Hurston Festival, was also an elevated level of hometown pride born. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Especially young people tend to Eatonville so to see how Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and equally proud, creative and industrious, and mixed silly as any other racial group and peoples in the Americas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> It is the sincere love for this city to the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew can hear, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, the college plans after Eatonville after returning to the city administration or the police to work, which according to him could use some help. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73"> And even the younger ones, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned Eatonville correct to describe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> "Most people who are just passing through here, will think: 'Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after church. </seg>
<seg id="75"> "But if you actually stop for a moment, and his story, it is a very beautiful city." </seg>

<seg id="7"> All without the blue screen shot </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> That is certainly the future. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Now the company has better things to which it can concentrate, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This week we talked about the very superficial change of strategy by Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Windows 7 will be faster and not so many embedded applications. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Steve Ballmer noted that if the computer with the necessary equipment would instead with the commercial garbage to fill, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, it will only be for the few. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Everything is just a finding, if one considers that Microsoft Windows versions of one or another function and `extras' inflicted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The change of direction is worthwhile </seg>
<seg id="16"> Microsoft has the right to the operating system gradually loses in importance, just like the software. </seg>
<seg id="17"> As a Google chromium appeared on the network, was a part of the theory that it is the first step by Google in order to compete with Windows. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Many had cleverly pointed out that the browser is not operating. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The operating system as an indispensable part, will always be necessary, so that hardware and software can function simultaneously. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The operating system fulfills the role, function with his wife or his spouse can be compared when it comes to tell his mother anything. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> That's true. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The system will never disappear, but you must be connected to his `death ', not as an absolute but as relative truth, think. </seg>
<seg id="23"> What Ballmer this week said, is the confirmation of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The people give less attention each time the operating system, but more the Web browser. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The computer will only start to Firefox, Explorer or the chrome and execute every day we spend more time surfing than in the vicinity of the `window '. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What is the half of existing applications in the computer? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Less is more </seg>
<seg id="28"> And Windows compact 7 Must be much more compact than Vista. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> Interview - From the blood that was safe again </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hema-Quebec yesterday celebrated the 10th Anniversary of its founding, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to look, because Hema-Quebec is one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And above all, it has the public's confidence recovered, by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s had been severely shaken. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As you know, the blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross national blood-managed reserves during the 1980s with the HIV virus and the hepatitis C virus contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Given this tragedy and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Government of Canada in February 1994 a public, the judge Horace KREV led investigation, the aim was to clarify the circumstances to bring to such a tragedy had led, and Directives To a new disaster of this kind of behavior. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While judges KREV still hesitated, Available his report, presented at a committee several provinces on the legs, whose aim was to create a new system for the management of blood preserved in Canada to develop. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In Quebec, the committee met Gélineau this contract. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to reports from Gélineau and KREV were in Canada two blood banks founded: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, Canadian Blood and the society to the other provinces and territories of the two circuits. </seg>
<seg id="9"> `1998, when Hema-Quebec has begun its work, had barely 38% of people trust in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was disheartening. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Through the tremendous efforts made to the safety of the blood to improve and by working in this area during the following years, we have the public's confidence back ', she says, before she proudly points out that the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of the population of Quebec Confidence in Hema-Quebec had. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Dr. Décary reserves, however, aware that something `confidence is extremely fragile '. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since its inception on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec act in accordance with the principle of prudence. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At this time we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, told this woman, which since its founding in 1998 the line holds. </seg>
<seg id="15"> `And we have not had the slightest idea whether this disease through the blood could be transferred. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So we "made us one of the main guidelines of the reports of KREV and Gélineau, according to the exclusion measures apply if you do not know if a disease progresses slowly, as is evident in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is the case, the by a degeneration of the brain expresses, which inevitably leads to death. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So we took in April 1999, no blood of persons who since 1980, longer than a month in the United Kingdom had stopped. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Well, a few years ago was without any doubt, proved that this disease through the blood is transferred. </seg>
<seg id="19"> To us this incident has shown that the principle of prudence that we applied, certainly has a meaning. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In 1999 the market a much more accurate techniques for detection of HIV: The nucleic acid test (NST), which allow direct in the blood of the donor, the presence of the virus itself prove, and not the antibodies against the virus, such as The tests used previously was the case. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation period, between the date on which the person has been infected and, when the first viruses through our proven techniques in the blood can be held, said the specialist. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This period was a period of less than a week reduced. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It was a risk that some donors may be infected without knowing it, and we do not recognize could be reduced significantly. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These improvements enabled, the risk of AIDS through a blood transfusion to be transferred to a considerable extent, be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Today is one of 12 million people risk, with HIV infected blood to preserve. </seg>
<seg id="26"> `In other words, that 12 million would have to distribute blood before someone would be infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Since Hema-Quebec each year from 400,000 to 500,000 blood distributed, it would be more than 24 years before a case occurs when the HIV through a blood canned has been transferred. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I think that we probably feel now, if you get a transfusion or prescribes to restore health ', says head of the Directorate of Hema-Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="29"> `Our challenge for the next ten years is to improve the safety of our products. </seg>
<seg id="30"> You never know what pathogens can get into the system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Only last year on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus emerged that, just like the West virus by insects on the blood is transferred. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We must continuously monitor ', continues Dr. Décary continue before they stressed that Hema-Quebec alongside a secure supply also a sufficient supply to make available. </seg>
<seg id="33"> `The demand is rising because the population is aging. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Since the treatments to combat cancer are aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The aging of the population also affects the blood donor network, which on average only 3% of blood donations for residents of Quebec are appropriate. ' </seg>
<seg id="36"> It can be a healthy man, 18 years or older and suitability criteria are met, every 56 days, so six times a year, donate blood. </seg>
<seg id="37"> On average, 14% of the people, their blood available, not because they, for example, AIDS or malaria are ill, and who traveled to a country is, where malaria is widespread, is for one year from blood donations excluded. </seg>
<seg id="38"> `With these 3%, we create it, to obtain an inventory of the needs of the hospitals represents. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Lack of supplies are very rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But we must be members of this donor network renewed if they are older and no longer donate blood. </seg>
<seg id="41"> It is difficult for people to convince, to donate blood, but above all to keep and to encourage them to bring regular donors to be. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The life today is so hectic that one rarely finds the time, an hour when blood donations to spend ', regrets Francine Décary. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With an annual budget of 297 million U.S. dollars Hema-Quebec provides not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, skin and eyeballs, which are almost exclusively for serious violations of fire is used. </seg>
<seg id="44"> These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they Hema-Quebec is temporarily stored, including the only public cord blood bank manages Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In the umbilical cord, previously thought to be biomedical waste, is located in rich blood stem cells, which can serve serious diseases such as leukemia, to treat. </seg>
<seg id="46"> `A few weeks ago we celebrated our thousandth of the storage cord blood sample, and we plan to more than a thousand stations. </seg>
<seg id="47"> `We should probably early next year to begin, it transplants to make available ', explains Dr. Décary continue the program of cord blood loss describes as very popular. </seg>
<seg id="48"> `Many mothers are convinced not have access to ', because Hema-Quebec lacks the resources to this complex and costly program in all hospitals to offer Quebec. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Freedom of expression - The orwellsche speech by Barrick Gold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In its edition of 17 Le Devoir in September a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Assistant Director-General of Canada's Barrick Gold mine gold. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirmed and pursued a orwellsche logic that the largest gold mining company in the world, a libel action over six million against three authors and a small publishing house without resources aspired, with the goal of a `transparent public debate 'to open. </seg>
<seg id="4"> If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, then they do not have to judge the truth, especially in the case of defamation lawsuits, but about the law. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As expected, this fundamental difference was made by Mr. Garver totally ignored. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Because for Barrick Gold is the best way to a public debate, everyone in the ruin to drive, the dares, one of their opposing views to represent. </seg>
<seg id="7"> No matter how the process runs out, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight, from the pockets of the almost inexhaustible gold mine to be paid . </seg>
<seg id="8"> The tactics in this unequal battle is also often the defenders to ruin a friendly regime in order to force the opposite side silenced and also makes every deter dares to revisit the issue. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, they would have their view of things in front of public opinion must be present. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Contrary to what many of the countries in which Barrick Gold operates, and there is access, are in Canada debates usually through the exchange of ideas and not by truncheon blows out. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It would therefore suffice if the goldmine their books and records and disclosed a real debate had opened, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent auditing, which shed light on this question would bring. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But Barrick Gold appears no confidence in the public opinion and whisks the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand motion aside. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Could perhaps explain Mr. Garver, as he simultaneously to a `public 'debate may ask and yet the views of these public disregard? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apparently, this word in the world of the Vice President only generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians, a pretty narrow view of the concept. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy itself slanderers have the right to speak. </seg>
<seg id="16"> What Barrick Gold does not understand - or will not understand - is that the public, the authors and publisher of Canada supports Noir, it does so mainly because they are the brutal attitude of gold declines. </seg>
<seg id="17"> These public is ready to listen and to Barrick judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a frame, as many perceive Gag-action (during the `public debate 'Barrick Gold currently has an exposure to The authors of Noir Canada addressed in which they demanded of them, this concept no longer use ...). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, is the plea from Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth, which is essential for any democratic society. </seg>
<seg id="19"> They completely deny the right to quote from credible sources and facts and interpretations to discuss the basis of intellectual work. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If it works in a country like Canada is impossible, themes to explore and discuss the range of companies in this world do not like who else can do? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If Barrick Gold really a public and transparent debate wanted, they could lead by the scientific standards followed by the authors of Noir Canada were used. </seg>
<seg id="22"> She has a right to respond. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The university environment to which we belong, has long, debates and disagreements to grips with and conflicts to resolve. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The disproportionate action by Barrick Gold shows clearly that, in contrast to what she pretends not to want to have a transparent debate. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate, and it is time that governments take measures to this type of unjustified actions limit. </seg>

<seg id="43"> In truth, however, none of these companies actively, which, according to Angeklagtem was a lack of orders. </seg>
<seg id="44"> However, he could from the companies benefit: At the request of his accomplices, the lawyer Zsolt Szentes, with the preparation of the company's founding documents was instructed, he, on behalf of the company's invoices to the charge associated Clubs issued, such as Atlasz and Y -Generáció. </seg>

<seg id="54"> His previous indications were that less detailed, and although he had already pledged several times, fully informed of everything to report his confession is still pending. </seg>
<seg id="55"> So the question remains open whether it is in its interest is whether the Socialists a pact with him regarding the restitution of most of the damage caused by HUF 50 million have been completed, and whether award in return is ready to take responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="56"> It is quite possible that the surcharge now "insulted" plays, after his requests to mitigate the detention and house arrest on deaf ears were. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> At the auction buyers tend to spend more and thus offered for sale to overestimate. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York is now succeeded in the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior to discover. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the "Science" magazine published study that people want in a competition like an auction on eBay, not beaten, and are therefore willing, even to pay excessive prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The researchers have tried to schedule the neurological this "game" with experimental auctions to explore. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the others attended a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of subjects using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) investigated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In both games, participants could win money, however, an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, losers in the auction measured in the bidding over the opponent plays a major role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Among many other functions, this brain region for the "self reward" of the nervous system responsible. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The researchers believed, therefore, the price could be achieved by avoiding an over-reaction of the striatum explain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> To her thesis to underpin the economists in the research group studies in addition to tracking the money employed. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this case, three groups against a partner under different conditions bid. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The control group was the true value of the product indicated, then they have made their bets. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another group were also 15 U.S. dollars reward promised in the event that they are winners from the game show. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The third group received 15 U.S. dollars before the auction, in the event of a lost game also were lost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The difference between the two groups existed only so that the emphasis at the one on the gains, while the other was on the losing. </seg>
<seg id="16"> As evidence for the hypothesis neurologists were expressed but the members of the "Losing against" playing group to higher operations prepared than those in the control or the "profit" group. </seg>

<seg id="17"> "These results can be from any previous economic theory derived. </seg>
<seg id="18"> These have the observed behavior in auctions only with the joy of winning, or the risk avoidance reasons. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Worldwide suffer from some half a billion people under chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease among the leading causes of death listed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The number of people infected here is estimated at hundreds of thousands, however, be dealt with only seven thousand, what it is that patients often do not know they are infected. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> Hepatitis is the generic term for viruses triggered by various infectious liver disease. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are frequent, however, the differences between the pathogens and the diseases from each other. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Depending on the pathogen spread the hepatitis virus in two different ways: for hepatitis A and E by the digestive tract (for example through contaminated food or water), for hepatitis B, C and D may be the virus through blood and other body fluids (such as semen, Vaginal secretions or saliva) transferred. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Passengers will be a vaccination against the virus A and B in any case recommended against the virus C, there is no vaccine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The symptoms of hepatitis A show about two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated food and are generally of Unwohlbefinden, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea accompanied. </seg>
<seg id="9"> After the jaundice occurs on the skin and the eyes to the chair is bright, dark urine, and the convalescence may take up to two to three weeks time. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Worldwide died around 1 million people in the hepatitis B triggered far more serious diseases like liver cancer and cirrhosis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The main reason for this is that only an estimated one in ten infected people in drug treatment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Most people infected do not know about their illness decision, since the pathogen insidious liver cells destroyed - in many cases show the first symptoms after 20-30 years. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There are three groups where the disease occurs more frequently: those who before 1991 have undergone a blood transfusion, drug addicts, and tattooed. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C sufferers worldwide at 200 million. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Believers have less pain? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> As the latest research results show that the religious faith as a kind of "painkiller" effect, which is already the death of Catholic martyrs makes it easier to provide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Oxford University scientists have conducted an interesting experiment: It was investigated to what extent the belief in God the pain of the people affected, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph". </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the course of the investigation were rather bizarre, each with 12 electric shocks believers and atheists, while a painting of the Virgin Mary studied. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the results showed the believers were the bulk of the pain off. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Using a brain scan technology could even be demonstrated that the Catholics part of their brain were activated, for the pain regulatory jurisdiction. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The investigation was the first in a research project in which scientists also next to philosophers and theologians of various departments of the university participate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> When the experiment was a sparkling volunteers connected to the left hand tied, which delivered electric shocks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The participants were asked to come heavily on two paintings to concentrate: First, an image of the Virgin Mary, painted by the 17th Sassoferrato Century, and secondly, Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with an Ermine." </seg>
<seg id="10"> The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful a kind of religious trance would rise, while da Vinci's image selected because it is scarcely different from the other paintings and was perceived as reassuring. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The trial ever spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and received during this period a total of 20 shocks in four stages, while they are either the religious or the other should see paintings. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Catholics reported that they had at the sight of the Mother of God "in safety" felt as if they "cared" would be, and that they had "peace and tranquility" felt. </seg>
<seg id="13"> During the viewing of religious painting, they have over 12% reported less pain than if they work Leonardo had in mind. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the trial, said that similar effects could also be combined with other strong images even when limiting the atheist cause, you just have to find the photo. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "We have to find a picture that is very positive feelings triggers, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "The practice of faith should change our personality, and does so in many cases," said Wright. </seg>
<seg id="18"> According to these excellent results will remain only question is what effect the Madonna image of Leonardo or any other similar painter on the regulation of pain believers would. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> To celebrate their tenth birthday, Google can rightly say: it is in the pockets of people just to see how over their heads in the sky: You know, where people have spent their holidays to which doctors they go and what they moves. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And so that is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of Google. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the direction of skeptics who Orwellschen of horror are plagued visions, he Align: This would be just the essence of Web 2.0 overlooked. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main goal of Google was to have more personal information about users to collect and so the original objective of the company closer to what they're "all information of this world order" wants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Schmidt said Google was after ten years of work weltverändernder still only at the beginning of information gathering. </seg>
<seg id="7"> When asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google would be able to questions like "What shall I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?" to answer, but software programs were not yet able to because they are not enough about the user know. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of its Internet search keywords would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which was searched, and the pages visited. </seg>
<seg id="9"> For example, two years ago introduced "Personalized Search" allows visitors to its own search history to store and later to fall back, so much more precise hits later can be generated, and at the same logic based on the so-called "Recommendations", with which The system customized products and services based on the earlier preferences recommends. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The users, however, wonder what in the event of a data abuse happened - "If you nachschaut what I do '- show some concern whether the Google data monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In most cases, however, it is rather the firm represented, potential power, the frightening effects, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the quest for freedom or rebellion against the power that many Internet users on Rejection triggers. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, it is a proven fact that the search not only saved, but in case the occasion also be given to third parties, and in these cases, laws, there is no protection for the personal rights of Internet users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A prime example was the recent action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the wake of Google's Brazilian government information presented by the community site called Orkut "were collected and also enabled the identification of pedophilia. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Rights to personal users worried but still could breathe again in May, when Google jointly with the civil rights organization EFF successfully against the FBI went to court: Google may be in the future with any point of the Constitution be forced to provide information to the FBI for a secret inquiry surrendered. </seg>
<seg id="15"> (However, the Federal Government has successfully passed the issuance of 50,000 Web addresses and 1,000 search terms, referring to the years prior to Minors Act, adopted obtained, but it was the list of individual users, or whose Web and search list to retroactively deprived of two months.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Google's image remains so controversial: Those who dislike her personal data out, because the use of Google services, the loss of their private and intimate sphere of fear, whip the company itself with the conservative performing companies rightful indignation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Meanwhile, the American "geek culture", which in many countries and is enthusiastic computer fans, activists and unites users, the next generation of "cool operator" in them, unlike Microsoft, the market leader, thanks to Windows, even if both to the same objective fighting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> One possible reason is that Google's users, as opposed to Microsoft has not demanded identification codes, and his services free of charge so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package far more attractive, young and seem to be cooler than the official Practices of the software giants. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Geeks imply the other hand, the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet razor sharp - a relationship, especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" at the center stage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> When "Web 2.0" is in fact nothing more than to collaboration, say, the user deliberately left traces and use the available channels of communication, and even if the proportions are different individually, remains the same merits, namely to show publicly. </seg>
<seg id="21"> An average young person may simultaneously on several community portals to manage his profile - from Facebook on Xanga, this means other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm combine, and all this can finally into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or blip. fm mount. Moreover, blogs can lead to the most recent photo galleries automatically, which on Flickr or Picasa are geostet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> And a good number of other cases shows: When viewing the photos of the party last night soon finds out the girlfriend, with whom her unfaithful boyfriend amuses, or the employee is dismissed because he is in his blog just too honest his anger over the corporate air makes - one thing is sure: The term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Who is a leading online life, is what it is cheap there - it could be around the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth formulate. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And who is trying to keep something secret, or even the Google monopoly to circumvent the like can do - such as Scroogle, a tool that on the Google search engine accesses, but intentionally leaves no traces. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Not a few people deliberately do not register at the Community pages, so that they can not be found, but also the on-line applications from Google such as word-processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, you can bypass with alternative versions, which no huge server parks are bound and therefore also not the best profile of users generate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Public opinion, however, banned it waits until Google shows its true face. </seg>
<seg id="27"> With its current value of $ 156 billion, the company even before IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the Advertising AdWords / AdSense threaten the revenues of Advertising agencies, and the ever faster services are introduced not only Microsoft but also other software developers headaches. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Critical viewers can find, however, the opposite poles disquieting: for example, has led to a protest group of employees totally rejected the charges after the company's own kindergarten were doubled, also said the management, multiple meals for employees was too costly. This all seems quite mild but on the other hand, indicates that Google in 2006 before the Chinese government even went into the knee and with a consent agreement was that all regimes critical hits, or those who are against good taste violated, would be filtered out. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The internal rules of the group reads, in advance that no new service is advertised, but only if those already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years back some meaningful upside: While some believe that Google's book and Magazinscan and archiving project will meanwhile proportions that the company soon with the Supreme Court would have to deal with, so are other much more because of the System "health" worried that the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and issues permits. </seg>
<seg id="30"> And the fact that Google is building a genetic database, delivers the next generation of sci-fi authors already the substance - such as "Scroogled," the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best manner orwellschen a future in which a man thanks to Google nahbar related data is frightening. </seg>

<seg id="3"> In the first round is half the money spent. </seg>

<seg id="5"> "We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President in the American House of Representatives, and said that we need to agree only on paper. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The compromise reached over the rescue package supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said on the outcome: The program is effective and it is efficient, but we need to do more. According to Pelosi were it not for the rescue of Wall Street, but about the helm of the economy rumzureißen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The written version of the package was completed before the opening of Asian markets, namely, Sunday evening Washington time clock 8 (Central European Time Monday 2 clock morning), published, but has no soaring on the stock markets triggered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On Monday the House of Representatives approves first on the bill to stabilize the economy in 2008, then the Senate's turn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> President George W. Bush said on Saturday evening with Pelosi and even the White House welcomed the news about the agreement. </seg>
<seg id="11"> We are satisfied with the progress of the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties, our markets to stabilize and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The program, however, differs from the original recommendation of the Bush Administration that the 700 billion U.S. dollars at once for the purchase lazier, with aggressive lending securities should be spent. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a first tranche will be up to half of the 700-billion-dollar amount spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the congress as expected on Monday on the Seton will vote. This sum will cover the purchase of aggressive lending, securities that are worse, and the other 100 billion USD should the president decide. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The program is run by a separate Commission, which is also the president of the Federal Reserve belongs. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision from the Congress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> For the purposes of the Act, the Ministry of Finance may also apply a combination of tactics: It can simultaneously bad loans, mortgages, and burdened with mortgages to buy securities, or other "toxic" loans. </seg>
<seg id="17"> As responsible persons of the Ministry reported the purchase in an auction, as well as directly made. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The law allows the affected companies, in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance of the alarming means guaranteed, and the company expected damages to pay fees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Henry Paulsen said: The Act defines the necessary resources so that up to 700 billion U.S. dollars as emergency assistance to the U.S. financial system can be made available, whether it be for the large-scale buying bad funds, their insurance, or to avoid a systemic risk, by the collapse of a major financial institution is triggered. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We shall take the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready for the introduction of the Act, once it was signed, so Paulson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The leaders of the troubled and now dependent on government assistance, however, banks may reckon that their severance payments in the overseas slang loosely "golden handshake" called by the government be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="22"> A reduction in salaries, there will be only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance each aushilft. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The reduction means in essence that if the Ministry as part of an auction ankauft, said the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the disused bank chief in the pension deported. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In the case of a direct purchase of bad loans will aggressively turn on the government to ensure that the managers salaries not be exaggerated. </seg>
<seg id="25"> On the picture is also that the existing Golden Handshake contracts not be changed - the restrictions apply only to new agreements, so the more people participate in the program. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries be regulated by law, said the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> The state is gaining participation rights at the participating banks, so the risk to taxpayers decreases, as they also can participate as soon as the economy and hence the bank again rescued better. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The draft law stipulates that the President of the Congress in the next five years, a proposal must, like the taxpayers their money lost from the financial sector will be back again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> There were, however, skeptics on both sides, in relation to the plan have expressed their doubts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> That is not what the American people expect of us, the plan protects the taxpayers' money in no case, said the California Republican Darrell Issa. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The elite is in danger </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The phenomenon had already been a few days ago revealed as the Chamber of Deputies against 700 billion-dollar savings of the White House agreed: One large part of the Americans was and is more interested in Wall Street to punish than to save the economy. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms yesterday's edition of The New York Times, which reported how the crisis over step divides the Republican Party, which is increasingly splitting into their old and moderate East Coast soul, always state institutions and the business community and beneficiary those neoconservative, the "where Washington and the financial world is hostile and mainly in the south and the center of the states voters. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This part of the party owes its rise above the voice of his that I mentioned above. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This example just mentioned, however, is only a small part of the great changes that the current economic earthquake, or even already announcing itself: not only in the U.S., even throughout the West and perhaps even beyond will be affected by this. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Both in the states as well as in Europe seems to be the long-feared crisis to speed events, which under these new conditions finally take shape and come to light. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In fact, the crisis means a decline of the banking and financial institutions, which has close links to foreign countries and also possess a tremendous amount of assets managed by private households, which in a single state resident. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This means an immediate political problem for governments: namely, how it compared to the affected families is to behave, which is also an enormous mass of voters. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The crisis appears so globally economically, politically, on the other hand, it is almost purely national. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The political internationalism seems to be in the sidelines to his speech and his right to have lost: The evidence for this is obvious from the EU to pursue that because of their division into various national and international conflicts no common way to find white. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Therefore, all now reckon with the intervention of the state; rescue plans, new rules, and especially distribution of relief funds: Since the crisis was always serious, only the United States in the economic situation without foreign help to rescue. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And in addition to the resources they have also the legitimacy to use them: hence two not to be judgmental about conditions - under certain circumstances - which probably no other international organization and no market in a similar way can draw is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> That new emphasis on the state-national element will be paid in the rest is in perfect harmony with the growing importance that recently in the economy with a closely related sector is brought in connection: the territoriality. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Paradoxical way, it is precisely now, when we are so convinced were long in a networked total occurred realm to be in a realm of increasingly sophisticated technology, the intangible that we once observed, as our future but more and more of the essential material things will depend on: water, crop and oil. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This can certainly all from one place to another in the world are transported, but are nevertheless extremely narrowly circumscribed with a piece of ground - a territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It is the one who possesses such a territory has, over another, in a yield-free, water-free or oil-free area lives in advantage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I come now to the second novelty, but a short slot requires. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Who Territory, who Government, who Policy says, says hence leadership. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In this sense, it seems that the financial crisis two converging phenomena to produce. </seg>
<seg id="21"> One is awareness of the need Leaderships respected, so the need for someone who knows how to get things in place. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing tours, especially those of the economy, which is considered inadequate and full of shadow zones have turned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Moreover, finally, a deep-reaching and in some ways even more worrying aspect: A loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of Unzweckmäßigkeit, a feeling of distance, all on a whole class of managers of the Western countries targeted. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It seems to be the conviction among large segments of the population the way for motorways, that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but their idea world, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whether, whose salary is the Majority as always alien and Overturning represents. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The demand for leadership nourishes So a branched underground but powerful movement of the disempowerment of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unexpected "revolts" in the electorate and the sudden reversal of the collective state of mind lately: starting with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, on the collapse of the Labor Party in Britain, towards the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the Right in Italy a role here). </seg>
<seg id="26"> One gets the impression, as did the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectuals creditors, some would say their format, with more understanding of problems and therefore less representative value regarding what today in the lower social strata of the West is going on and from the financial crisis exacerbated and to Überdimensionalität driven. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Given all this, it would be quite an exaggeration, of a "rebellion of the masses" to speak. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The eyes wide open but to keep it safe, however, is not. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The historic movie theaters closed because of the beneficiary multiplex cinemas. </seg>

<seg id="4"> This picture of director Giuseppe Tornatore, with effect describes what is currently in the major urban centers in Italy, and also in the provinces, happens. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The process of exclusion of cinemas, with the birth of the large multi-hall complexes in the periphery started, it means the long-term death for the Einsaalkino in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irreversible, but also the traits of a cultural crime carries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Affected are mostly historical places full of memories, "it is like to lose a friend with whom you have a piece of street full of emotion go," said the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" to him 20 years ago the Oscar and the great Price of Cannes revenue. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists, in a probably forever lost cinema world to live. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The figures, which ANEC, the central trade association delivers, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the tremendous amount by 316 traditional cinemas must close this mine paid for the most part, the cinemas in big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 to 5 in Turin and Palermo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Among the most affected regions include the Emilia-Romagna, with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41st </seg>
<seg id="9"> This demonstrates that the culprit multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinema has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the lists of Lombardy, 81 are both in the Tuscany, as well as in the Emilia-Romagna. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "The business has improved in an irrational manner developed," said Paolo Protti, president of ANEC, "it is useful to ensure that new structures, but in the first place is the preservation of existing, as a hall closes in the city, are not all of his regulars ready to replace the old a multiplex cinema in the peripheral facilities. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And here remains the lack of budget for the fund industry association of the outer Eight: the state recorded debt burden is around 10 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral position that the government does not respect the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In order to maintain the sector would be 16 to 18 million euros a year smarter. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> What is interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which due to fears of the old cinema has decided this by an agreement between the municipality and the ANEC to protect it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy, which aims promote the traditional cinemas to protect and support, both in the historical center, as well as in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Among the planned measures are also divisions for fiscal Before the cinema operators as well as benefits for the public regarding the transport: there will be allowed into the areas of the Center verkehrslimitierten to drive and also to lower parking fees to park. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "It is a welcome initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and beyond even new design concepts. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Certainly, but we also need a better audio and video equipment, to oppose the super power of Multiplexsäle something to be able to align, because the audience is more demanding today. </seg>
