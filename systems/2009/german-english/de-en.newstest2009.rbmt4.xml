</hl>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> To be sure this means yet no victory. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The congresswomen must negotiate namely a few more details of the agreement before they may publish the final version of the law and may vote about that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The plan to the support of the financial system is negotiated on Monday in the American congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On Sunday this said the chairperson of the committee on bank services and finance services Barney Frank of the agency Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the senate could be voted according to different statements probably at the earliest on Wednesday over the plan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to economist a communication should about the fact that the plan is dismissed, that are first important psychological factor for an animation of the financial markets. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After that it comes however to a "disillusion" based on the complicated mechanisms how one could help the markets also in the practice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Paulson: The plan must be effective </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "We obtained an important progress. </seg>
<seg id="14"> We clarified our different views in addition, look should like a package to the stabilization of the market", said the democrat Nancy Pelosi vis-Ã -vis the agency Bloomberg. </seg>
<seg id="15"> According to your words it could come yet on Sunday to an end voting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Representatives of the legislator met in the early hours of Sunday with the American Treasury Minister Henry Paulson in order to lend the government fund its final form. </seg>

<seg id="23"> Therewith one wanted calm namely the investors before businesses on the Asian financial markets, that lie in the first time zone, where a decision of the congress could influence the businesses on Monday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Until now however is not yet very clearly when both chambers of the American congress will vote over the law, also rules vagueness about whether the negotiations in last minute could not fail yet yet due to a problem. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The legislators hope that it is dismissed in the next days. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The law however will learn a few more variations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The total certain to the aid for the system is supposed to be divided in two parts. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The initial 350 billions of dollar are supposed to be placed as quickly as possible ready how President George Bush demanded. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The congress can block however the fallout of the remaining money if it has the impression, that the program does not fulfill its function, and to be sure more by more far 100 billions of dollar and later the final 350 billions of dollar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Bush appraises progress in negotiations positively </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The president has to be sure in this decision a power of veto, to be sure the congress can be overrule veto. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In spite of these variations, the basic idea of the program are exist remained however, that was based on that, finances for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell, to attain because hundreds of thousands of American are no longer in a position to repay its mortgages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> "We everything prepared. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The House of Representatives should be in a position to vote on Sunday over the law, the senate then on Monday", so the republican senator Judd Gregg. </seg>
<seg id="35"> With the progress, also the American President Bush satisfied appeared. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Its speaker Tony Fratto explained, let Bush be satisfied with the progress of the Saturday and "would appreciate the two-sided exertion to stabilize our financial markets and to protect" our economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Restriction of golden parachute </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The chairperson of the bank committee of the senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, let be reported, would have the legislators itself on a responsibility for the money program, that protection of the taxpayer before losses, that conclusion of privileges and a timetable united for the financing of the plan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The new law should restrict also the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies, who are involved in the program and sets a from shot on, to which the supervision should attend over the fund. </seg>
<seg id="40"> This should lead the treasury. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "We very hard on that worked and a large progress toward an agreement reaches, that functions and for the market and for all Americans is important", so Paulson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The plan reckons also with an aid for homeowner, who have problems with the repayment of its mortgage. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The government should negotiate new rates in mortgages, that buys up it whereby the goal exists therein of sinking the monthly costs for the debtors and it them to enable, its houses to retain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Marek: Psychological aid </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> The proposed plan is after the head economist of Patria Finance David Marek a good idea, but the conversion becomes very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="46"> "And to be sure therefore because one do not know, through which mechanism and around which price the problematic assets are bought up. </seg>
<seg id="47"> That will be decisively for that, divide like the finance sector and the government the losses among one another", said Marek this week iHNed. cz to the server. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Whether the plan is dismissed now or beginning next week, is not decisive after Mareks view. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "Much it is more important that the congresswomen agree on that to support the plan and that they as quickly as possible dismiss it. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The psychological meaning of the agreement about the fact that it comes to a dismissal, the most important is in this moment", emphasized Marek. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Duel on knife cutting edge: MP3-Player against mobile phone. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> We advise you in your choice </seg>
<seg id="3"> While almost each mobile phone MP3-Dateien can play back, yet no MP3-Player can telephone. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Therefore it looks naturally so that it is better to buy itself only a telephone. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In spite of everything, there are sufficient reasons why one should gain himself an independent Player. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The choice depends entirely the future owner on the type of the utilization and the claims. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Certainly one buys himself hardly for at home a crazy expensive turntable in order to sound on that the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from qualitative point of view there is also no objective reason for that. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If have however LPs with type skirt, jazz or blues on the shelf, dream probably at least of one. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So that is expressed also with the music on trips, therefore with compressed music, simplified - music in the MP3-Format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also here there are price categories and quality categories. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For the one, it is will bear perhaps not acceptable to issue for a Player eight thousand crowns, just as however a Pink-Floyd-fan probably hardly headphones for twenty crowns of the market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Two extreme between which it gives for every sufficient room. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The selection extend is diversified. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Also the service life of the batteries is decisively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some good Music Players can play back much more than only music, but that what mobile phones can, they do not create once in outline. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern device is to be used so universal like the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Next to the primary functions, that telephoning and the shelf, it can represent music and videos, both receive, it has once a better, once a worse camera and can navigate perhaps also. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And if one includes yet the Smartphons and Kommunikatoren, one has almost a small computer in the pocket. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a small miracle, for no refrigerator can grill and can photograph no television. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Yet the universality of the mobile phones entails also disadvantages. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more frequent you will have to load it however. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the playing back of music is one of the largest energy gluttons. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Only a few mobile phones can play back music more long than a ten twelve hours, mostly is it much fewer. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this regard, Music Players (special the simplest) are clearly more efficient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Therefore you should calculate in the cheap mobile phones therewith that they cannot play back more long music than a couple of hours. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you telephone then off and at yet, buy yourself to the security rather another charger for the office - that applies also to more expensive devices. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In MP3-Playern, you will not have this problem, also that less good at least 9 hours hold uninterrupted business suddenly loading from. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> A further problem exists then if one wants to record the music on the mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately only a slight part of the devices controls an USB conclusion, moreover each mobile phone cannot be connected without special software directly to a PC. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Naturally one can record will be used the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card harvest devices without reduction with the tiny storage cards finished, that in mobile phone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> In Players, you require up to exceptions (iPod) no special software. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They need to line the device only over USB PORT with music out of your PC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Most mobile phones and Player design even a music library, organized after the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or for example the estimation through user. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some devices portray only the tree structure of the Adressverzeichnisses, similar to the windows explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephones with operating system). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Players are to be served more easily, mobile phones can more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In the selection of a concrete device, you should inquire especially about the service life of the rechargeable battery, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and naturally also the serve comfort. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Music is for you above all scenery and hear it every day only shortly for example in the streetcar, passes an any mobile phone, that plays back MP3-Dateien. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What can really already almost each mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They also not particularly must control, which music formats can process a mobile phone or a Player. </seg>
<seg id="41"> MP3 create will be everyone, and most music that you get, straight in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format belonged to spread can play back that most, and moreover most devices also music in the WMA format. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Less AAC (a format, the Apple and its iPods use) is usual. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Better mobile phones enable also the purchase of music Online. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One needs to call only the corresponding sides of a provider (or another supplier) over Internet mobile, and one already can acquire a song or album. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This service can already on and for itself a striking argument be why one should gain himself a music mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately the offer of the provider is bad and is restricted mostly only to fast radio hits. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The prices are not also the lowest. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Generally however one assumes that straight this type of the sale of music (would be it over GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in the future will control the music industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> That carry the mobile phone with itself. </seg>
<seg id="51"> If you have desire to sound somewhat, grasp forget lies after the mobile phone in the jacket pocket, during the Players at home. </seg>
<seg id="52"> It depends however whether you carry also always headphones or at least a wireless absolve arrangement with itself. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker, control almost each mobile phone that, but only the least MP3-Player. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The probably largest advantage of the music mobile phones will lie for many in the price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The cheapest cost normally less than three thousand crowns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> For three and four thousand crowns, you get already an entirely respectable Walkman. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The largest Handicap will be for that that no normal headphones are there. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The best and technically most matured telephones with a 3,5-mm-Ãffnung for normal headphones cost up to five ten thousand crowns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The advantage of the Players lies again in the easy operation. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The simplest - and unconditionally cheapest (see selection) - Player everyone cannot serve really. </seg>
<seg id="61"> A minimum at functions, the resemblance in the operation with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or for example the turntable is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="62"> It threatens no collision in form of an erroneously engaged mobile Internet and a subsequently horrendous calculation for data transmissions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> After which device one should grasp now </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> Also the cheapest mobile phones (for example Vodafone 527) control as a rule a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD and Ã¤.). </seg>
<seg id="65"> Also if you buy later a corresponding card, two thousand crowns suffice. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Yet attention. </seg>
<seg id="67"> In the basis models, as a rule only cards with a maximal capacity of 2 GB are supported. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the most expensive can read also 8-GB-Speicherkarten 8-GB-Speicherkarten 8-GB-Speicherkarten 8-GB-Speicherkarten 8-GB-Speicherkarten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> If you want to possess already a mobile phone and want to buy yourself another low-priced MP3-Player, grasp you after Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. </seg>
<seg id="70"> According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't have to put then more than 1100 crowns on the table. </seg>
<seg id="71"> If belong to the more demanding listeners, take dear specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). </seg>
<seg id="72"> These devices have independent serve buttons for MP3, and the serve comfort comes so at that of a single MP3-Players up to. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Furthest Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones have out of the series Walkman the same user interface like the individually sold MP3-Player, is here. </seg>
<seg id="74"> The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long rechargeable battery service life (normally 15 hours, maximally up to 35 hours) MP3-Player of the manufacturer named above perform you. </seg>

<hl>
<seg id="1"> The first virtual supplier comes already this year to the Czech Republic. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Perhaps </seg>
<seg id="3"> The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic quite is matured, the Czech suppliers offer practically all services on how they are offered also by its partners in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless something is missing here - a virtual supplier that forces the classic to lower praising. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Perhaps this will wait let no longer long for itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> That the Czech mobile phone suppliers to the most expensive in Europe work generally, about that we have already often on mobile. cz reported. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This also the telecommunication authority confirmed made by the way that aware that the price is higher for a SMS here than in the remainder of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the last steps of the European commission in the area regulation of the roaming fees it comes so probably to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone suppliers will be SMS out of foreign countries cheaper than at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> How does it come compare to are so high, that the prices in the Czech Republic in that Europe? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is simple, it is missing the competition that makes really a declaration of war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Perhaps sounds it paradoxically, gives in the Czech Republic it yet three mobile phone networks and a penetration of far more than 100%. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The mobile phone suppliers scold on the other hand gladly about the fact that there is extremely much competition on the Czech market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The pflichtet often also the chairperson of the advice of the Czech telecommunication authority Pavel by, that often had expressed in the past, that there would be no place in the Czech Republic for a further supplier. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It agrees probably that a classic supplier with an own network has no longer particularly many chances (by the way would become it probably also hardly yet frequencies find). </seg>
<seg id="15"> There is however another possibility - a virtual supplier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Just the entrance of virtual supplier on the mobile phone market entailed a clear mark-down on which then also the classic mobile phone suppliers had to react. </seg>
<seg id="17"> At the same time there was mobile or Virgin mobile before the entrance of such firms such as Tesco on the market in Great Britain similar voices such as in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It appeared however that there is for such suppliers place and that these can be really successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> By the way one needs to not to search long for examples. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We reported in February this over the start of the virtual supplier mobile King in Poland. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In only a year of half it succeeded this supplier to win more than 100 thousands of customer and to climb so to the five largest supplier of the country. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Behind mobile King, the finance group Penta, that in the Czech Republic stands at the same time among other things U: fon possesses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The advantage of virtual supplier exists at the same time therein that one can concentrate on a much more concrete target group. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order to be able to function effectively, need virtual suppliers namely much of less customer than a classic supplier. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They need namely no relatively high costs for the building, the business and the support of a mobile network. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the world, so the virtual suppliers profiare themselves normally as a Low-Cost-firms out - it offer cheap telephone conversations and SMS what is accompanied to be sure often by a less extensive service offer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> So Tesco mobile in Great Britain SMS offers for example cheaper at least around the half at than its competitors. </seg>
<seg id="28"> How however the example of mobile King in Poland shows, it can be also a right good gambit to set on a not clichÃ©-ridden target group. </seg>
<seg id="29"> This supplier directs itself namely specifically to men. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Real fellows select mobile King - the supplier, that them pleases and that it trust can", so David Seibert, the CEO of the Entertainment company mobile, the operator firm of this virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Heavily to say whether a similar draft could get a such as in Poland also in the Czech Republic foothold. </seg>
<seg id="32"> On that doubts also the press officer of Vodafone Miroslav. "The Czech market is for a market segment, on which most virtual suppliers are based, relatively small. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Moreover it is from the viewpoint the service offer relative gesÃ¤ttigt." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In the Czech Republic hopeless, mean the mobile phone suppliers </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> It is not certain however almost that, if a virtual mobile phone supplier the Czech Republic conquers, this mobile King be becomes. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "We do not dissuade see to be sure of an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations particularly hopeful. </seg>
<seg id="37"> It will come sooner to a market entrance of mobile King in other countries of our region", says in a telephone conversation for mobile. cz Jana press officer of the finance group Penta. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Indirectly it confirmed so that the present mobile phone suppliers in the Czech Republic are not inclined particularly to this thought. </seg>
<seg id="39"> In the opposite, they try to do all for that that no potential competitor emerges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Your interest in a start of a virtual mobile phone supplier shows already for some time time the group GTS Novera that would like to undertake a further step in order to become a real competitor of TelefÃ³nica O2 in the area of firm customer. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "We have a large interest on that to offer our customer not only cable network, but rather also Mobilfunk-Telekommunikationsdienstleistungen. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And the earlier, the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Over this possibility, we negotiated repeatedly with all Czech mobile phone suppliers. </seg>
<seg id="44"> With some of them, we were able to reach already negotiation progress", so the press officer of the group Pavel Kaidl. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Perhaps now better times come. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Out of not official information follows that the first virtual supplier is to be expected perhaps until end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Until now however this is surrounded of an unÃ¼berwindbaren wall of the being quiet. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "In this moment we do not assume that in the Czech Republic place exists for a full virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market shows large specific characteristics vis-Ã -vis other markets. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Until now addressed us yet no subject with a complex and serious project in this area", means in its explanation for mobile. cz Vlastimil out of the press department of TelefÃ³nica O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> On the Spezifik of the Czech market, also further suppliers refer. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The press officer of T mobile Martina KemrovÃ¡ adds in rare agreement with the explanation of O2: "Until now we found yet no viable and two-sided advantageous project, construct one on that further kÃ¶nnte." </seg>
<seg id="53"> And it adds: "In the network of T mobile hardly a virtual supplier will emerge until end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="54"> In this moment, we would have to exist have already a concrete offer to be able to think around so short-termed." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone arranges its attention sooner on the fulfillment of the requests of the own 3G-Lizenz. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav means in addition: "For negotiations with potential virtual suppliers we are open, especially in the area division of costs and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> We regard just this from the viewpoint the customers as the best. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The action of the mobile phone supplier is to be understood easily, a further supplier would be named more competition, this would become sinking praising and through it also to a decline of the profits lead. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Why should therefore one ease the market entrance for such a competitor? </seg>
<seg id="62"> That the suppliers can pull at a cord, if it concerns somewhat, covers also the long back and forth around the origin of U: fon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> The probably strongest pressure toward came at present when U came: fon on the market, from the company T mobile. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Also the publicly accessible information of that covers that. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Now however just U suits itself: fon as an argument why one should not allow a virtual supplier. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Martina KemrovÃ¡ noted in addition: "The competition background of the mobile phone market was strengthened recently moreover yet through the market entrance of a fourth mobile phone supplier. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Under consideration of the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech republic is place obvious, that a new participant requests high at the market even and above all its services wÃ¼rde." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> In view of this Herangehensweise of the mobile phone supplier, the absolute the interest of the Czech regulating authorities amazes to be sure. </seg>
<seg id="69"> It does not concern has at the same time not only the bearing of that that in Czech unfortunately - in the difference to Great Britain and further highly developed countries - the competence to interfere into the economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="70"> This possesses excluding the office to the protection of the economic competition (ÃOHS). </seg>
<seg id="71"> This however related its entirely typical bearing to this total problematic nature. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> "The market entrance of a virtual mobile phone supplier would be then possible after it came to a contract conclusion between a mobile phone supplier and a virtual supplier over the Anmietung of the necessary infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Until now was locked was no such contract, for the offer of potential interested parties probable for the classic suppliers not sufficiently interesting", so in its answer on our inquiry KristiÃ¡n Chalupa of the department outside relations of the ÃOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> Of representatives of the supplier, such a formulation would not surprise. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Of an authority, that represent the consumer interests and should among other things on that eighth, that no one abuses its position on the market, is this more than doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Especially, if KristiÃ¡n Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual suppliers work very normally, is to be observed, contributed that its market entrance to a mark-down in mobile telephone services hat." </seg>
<seg id="77"> Probably however the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a mark-down do not belong to the interests of the ÃOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> Really shocking the almost already moving harmony of the three mobile phone supplier that results from its reactions is at this case. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question whether it concerns really only a chance, lies on the hand. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Just as the absolute same gasoline price is certain in the gas station only chance and the consequence of a hard competition. </seg>
<seg id="81"> "The authority no sign at all discovered in this thing, that point out an actions arranged against the competition, and therefore it has also no reason to interfere on any type into the matter. </seg>
<seg id="82"> None of the supplier has a dominant market position, therefore it has not also the corresponding increased responsibility for its actions on the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The necessary instruments for an opening of the mobile phone market for virtual suppliers are missing probably also the regulating authority for telecommunication", led Chalupa in its explanation on. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The interpretation of the dominating position on the market is one of many debatable points. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Naturally there is is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared of that after the telecommunication from the viewpoint the economic competition a single market. </seg>
<seg id="86"> On such a market, none of the Czech mobile phone suppliers possesses then naturally a dominating position. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Some right experts however offer another visibility manner - for the market entrance of a virtual supplier is always the approval of the network operator necessary. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And the mobile phone suppliers has - logical would prove - the monopoly for its network. </seg>
<seg id="89"> That means that it takes in a dominating position in a certain segment of necessity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Even if one does not go along however with this argumentation, it should be for the ÃOHS at least a warning that three mobile phone suppliers incidentally similarly advance. </seg>
<seg id="91"> At the same time troubles of a row of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) cover that they bump in negotiations with all suppliers into very similar hindrances. </seg>
<seg id="92"> The AbwÃ¤lzung of the responsibility on that is then in the telecommunication services a quite usual trick with which the ÃOHS of the entire matter dissociates itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> This was to be observed already in some similar cases. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately it is not arrive to put through in the novel dismissed recently of the telecommunication law the expansion of the competences the on the area of the economic competition in the telecommunication although a row by specialists had promised itself therefrom an improvement of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The representatives of the ÃOHS must know that only all too well, but they probably have other interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It goes already if no one views there </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> Unnoticed the functioning of any pseudovirtueller supplier, of which it gives several in the Czech mobile phone networks immediately, remains first once. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Firms, that issue own prices lists for mobile telecommunication services, are, that are only partly public however. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Normally it concerns namely firms, that act in the area Multilevel marketing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Own mobile telephone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia telecom, Starlife and other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The prices lists of these firms arrive normally only at selected. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The joke of the thing exists therein that the firm appears vis-Ã -vis the operator as a classic firm customer, who orders a large quantity at SIM cards. </seg>
<seg id="103"> As an important customer, he receives then special quotations (and other offers). </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem exists therein that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone suppliers forbid a similarly natured resale. </seg>
<seg id="105"> "Should it cases give, that you describe, can it itself around an injury of the contractual conditions act, with which we us then busy become, what a termination of the collaboration with the corresponding company lead can", answered Martina KemrovÃ¡ on our question to this problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> It is to be sure quite unlikely that so something does not get around in the responsible of the mobile phone supplier. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Especially in the case of the three mentioned firms, it can concern thousands of customer. </seg>
<seg id="108"> No operator opposes however such an action. </seg>
<seg id="109"> Out of the activity of these firms, profits to be neglected do not flow in them namely, simultaneously are impaired it - in the difference to the actual virtual suppliers - not through the actual official marketing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> On possible problems, Miroslav makes attentively: "The law enabled be used such types of speculations, in spite of everything the services of these firms only of a very slight percentage of the customers. </seg>
<seg id="111"> These must accept in addition that the SIM card in its telephone does not run on its name, they can order therefore not full about that like the normal customers of the mobile phone supplier." </seg>
<seg id="112"> Already alone that however at least strangely would have to occur that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> Moreover a further question opens itself for the ÃOHS. </seg>
<seg id="114"> The lock mobile phone suppliers block themselves before such an action the eyes, why it against a virtual supplier? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It is to be added that the ÃOHS has to the disclosure of such activities quite strong competences, and if it does not want, it must not itself with the explanation of the supplier, they would know nothing therefrom and its business conditions would become this forbid, satisfied give. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> When the Czech Republic is no longer most expensively </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> How in the text already repeatedly emphasized became, the market entrance of virtual supplier entailed a clear price decline in the different services. </seg>
<seg id="118"> At the same time have practically in all countries where virtual suppliers emerged, that tries classic supplier, whose origin practically more or few to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="119"> That of them used were arguments practically identical - a to smaller, and/or to very satiated market, problem in the quality of the services etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> In the advanced countries however the regulation organs interfered just in these moments, that tried to preserve in no way the interests of the mobile phone supplier, but rather that of its customers. </seg>
<seg id="121"> If let it be not through formal measures or formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator emerged, and this followed further. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately the Czech regulation organs throw themselves the entire case to like a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Do not come from our experiences we can eliminate ourselves the impression that vagueness in the competences in these cases is favorable more than. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> Yet we do not throw the gun into the grain. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If the background information agrees and soon a virtual supplier will emerge, the Czech mobile phone market will set itself perhaps soon again in motion. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If a supplier allows the origin of a virtual mobile phone supplier, the ÃOHS will not remain idle if it goes therefore to reject (to discriminate) further interested parties. </seg>
<seg id="127"> And the Czechs more expensively will telephone then finally no longer than the remainder of Europe. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> If we cannot be component of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="5"> With such a wish, 1945 should have turned some groups of Sudeten German to the US president. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This follows among other things out of a letter, that is been preserved in a private archive and that is stored today in the collections of the south bohemian scientific library. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The German of Krumau asks the American president in the letter, he should not permit the return of the "Sudetengaus" - that on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler taken in became - at Czechoslovakia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> "We have the situation correctly understood and want us actual the words be certain, that the American units not as an oppressor and enemies German territory enter, but rather as a deliverer", is named it in a letter, that with the words "persons whom the fate of the Sudetens is lies" signs at the heart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Because the connection lets assume the Sudeten German - in knowledge of the Czech national character - at Czechoslovakia, that they would expect brutality, inconsiderateness, the lack of understanding, suppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to receive for today and forever the protection domination over the BÃ¶hmerwald. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> "We cannot believe, that you without consideration on the view of a quarter million inhabitant this zone a country strange for us communicate, that minority suppresses and to remove tried and purely nothing at all to the victory of the allies contributed has", is to be read in the letter. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="11"> The reason why the authors cannot sign, is alleged the fear of RachegelÃ¼sten of the "Czech oppressors". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> If the US president doubt about of the attitude of the BÃ¶hmerwalddeutschen would cultivate, let it be sufficiently if it would initiate in the BÃ¶hmerwaldgau a referendum about that, whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or wanted to live under the protection domination of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Although the text of the letter somewhat naively likes to sound in current knowledge of the postwar story, it draws however in the opinion of some time witnesses a good picture with respect to the at that time expectations of the Sudeten German. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Also if the bohemian German at least had to suspect, that one would negotiate over its deportation out of the republic, vouched itself only few of them such a possibility generally. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some waited that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate for the Sudetens a type autonomy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Again others believed, they could remain simple in Czechoslovakia. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Also the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa that comes from Budweis confirms that. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It was used in the war as a Budweiser German in the navy at the Baltic Sea. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "There is no unambiguous legal interpretation for the roll of a steward - no legal specification describes this roll. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There is to be sure also no legal specification that forbids it the carrier to furnish services. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The law over the traffic knows only the term vehicle companion; its right and duties does not define it however", joins the speaker of the ministry Hanzelka unambiguously thereto. </seg>

<seg id="23"> "In a fluid method many dangers, the situation do not threaten is comparable with the service on board an airplane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Also here is not certain when turbulences come, and the stewardess can the head knock itself." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "A bus brakes however sharply, count naturally also the laws of the physics. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Just as in the city bus or in a streetcar. </seg>

<seg id="31"> The director does not look at its occupation also after the accident as risk pregnant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> "As soon as I get however the impression, that the occupation of the steward is risk pregnant, will paint I it. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The travelers can receive coffee and newspapers in the getting into. </seg>

<seg id="40"> The Slovenian truck was turned probably without blinking of the standing strip and had blocked the bus the trip. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The driver of the penance tried to avoid through a sharp maneuver, collided however with the right front part with the truck. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> DÃ¼sseldorfer hopes rest on Frankfurt </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> At large words, it is not missing in the letter of the WestLB board of directors at the colleagues of the house. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Through a bringing together of units the DÃ¼sseldorfer money institute with that Frankfurt Deka bank "the central money market house of the savings bank finance group" could emerge, is named it in the letter well known become on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The WestLB would bring in a "competence block" with persistent yield power into such a business. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And generally such a connection could be the decisive impetus to further alliance lungs in the country bank sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> So it reads if a board of directors in difficult time wants to demonstrate action capacity. </seg>
<seg id="7"> For the marred WestLB is as always under powerful pressure. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only on the part of the EU commission, but rather also through the federal agency for finance service supervision, that made clear that state government North Rhine-Westphalian not until recently, that would press time to find a future solution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Of one like always natured connections between the Deka bank, that know savings bank customer because of its Investmentsfonds, and the WestLB has been to be sure already for some time the speech - also on Frankfurt side. </seg>
<seg id="10"> To be sure Deka-bank-boss Franz Waas has know let the end of August in the model of the half year numbers, in a fusion of the house at the Mainzer country road with a country bank, about the Helaba or the WestLB, would see he no sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Yet the supervisory board of the Deka, that is carried ever to the half by the country banks and the savings bank associations, that board of directors delegates has to lead with the WestLB discussions about joint business activities. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the same time it could concern the money market business or parts therefrom. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The conversations have to be sure, is named begun it at the finance place, just recently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Of the Deka bank, that is with its 3000 colleagues among the more important employers at the finance place Frankfurt, the speech is not for the first time if it concerns consolidation in the savings bank sector. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It looked 2003 a moment long so, as could the Deka bank with the country bank Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba merge. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Out of this threefold alliance, became nothing however. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Hardly the plans had become public, spoke themselves the Hessian state government against a participation of the Helaba on that from. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Also the two other houses found then not together. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The country bank Rhineland-Palatinate went instead of its at the country bank Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg in Stuttgart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Yet there was again and again thought game over a connection of the Deka bank with country banks. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Finally GÃ¼nther Merl, chairman of the board of the Helaba had expressed itself to be sure, against simulations over a going together with its house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Independently therefrom the insight seems to ripen however that a moving together of the different houses of the publicly legal sector need does. </seg>
<seg id="23"> After now the Regional Diet Election in Bavaria is past, a connection of the BayernLB with the country bank Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg could nearer move first. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For the Helaba, that is not unconditional a good message. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The pressure to further fusions should go climbing, its gradually the partners for that from. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the south, it would be nurmehr junior partner although it has previously by far better stood through the finance crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The savings bank association and endorsement association Hesse Thuringia, that is involved with 85 percent in the Helaba, advanced a going together with the west LB again, beginning of the year a bar. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If remained in any case the norths LB. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Such geostrategical considerations are however only the one side. </seg>
<seg id="30"> On the other, it concerns the question how the different business models of the single houses fit to each other. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In June Merl expressed, that decisive question, with which business model the future capacity of the country banks should be guaranteed, savings bank association and endorsement association had been answered by the German not yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> At the end, also a dismantling could stand the west LB, that not even speaking is wished to be sure there. </seg>
<seg id="33"> So the speech is would be striven for then also in the letter of the board of directors there therefrom, it in any case a "total solution" for the house. </seg>
<seg id="34"> How the units single with the going together with the Deka bank lets bring under a hat, yet will appear. </seg>

<seg id="8"> The money comes both of private like also publicly legal banks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Losses are background at the daughter Depfa. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Staatsfinanzierer had re-financed itself according to a newspaper report for long milling machine projects, for which it lent money, extremely short-termed - what possible is because of the mistrust at the markets in the meantime no longer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the first half year 2008, the bar reserve of the bank had shrunk around 95 percent on 2.37 million Euro, also the equity quota had given way easily of 1.6 to 1.45 percent. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The running yields and the net yields out of finance businesses had fallen vis-Ã -vis the same period last year on zero, that decreased yields out of attribution to demands and certain securities as well as out of the solution of reserves in the credit business around more than 70 percent to 5 million Euro. </seg>

<seg id="14"> That formerly Staatsfinanzierer had itself after its denationalization in 1990 first of all with commercial real estate credit verspekuliert, that had been excluded then in the Aareal bank. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Because one earned in the classic country financing too little, the Depfa had grown stronger engaged then in infrastructure projects and the financing of partnership projects of private investors and the country (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. </seg>

<seg id="28"> But in view of the dynamics and imponderables of the crisis, there is probably no certainty. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is even not unthinkable that the financing must not be used full circumference in. </seg>

<seg id="3"> What means that? </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sylvana knows the word already out of one gas - in the new exchange put told it of Japan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "The school day first in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I was excited. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Already before the school way, I had Bammel. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I live at the edge of Tokyo toward Kawasaki and go 40 minutes with the train to the Tachibana Highschool. </seg>
<seg id="9"> I had to find the way alone, did not pass myself to the good fortune I. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The instruction start does not seem determined at the Tachibana so exertally like here at home in Lower Saxony. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The students drift in from eight o'clock until around twenty before nine a short discussion round with the teacher begins, the 'home room'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Yet before the instruction began, I was at the row to imagine. </seg>
<seg id="13"> At the same time I am not at all the type, that speaks gladly before people, yet in addition before a class of 40 students. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because I still had no school uniform, I dressed an old skirt of my guest mother, in addition blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In this procession, I stood therefore before the pulpit and try to express all correctly: 'Sayonara where she Sylvana ...' - Sylvana am named I, come from Germany and would have birthday in a week. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In the moment, I was very happily that I had begun already before well two years to learn the language. </seg>

<seg id="24"> In the recess, all its Bentos unpacked then. </seg>
<seg id="25"> My guest mother had made me also so a Lunchbox - that is once something else as the odes of German recess breads. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad out of cucumber and algae, fruit and a type meat in the Tofumantel. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Does a rat or a Schabe escape is named that in danger that it perceives also fear? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Also much animals have feelings. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Only how could one review whether they perceive the same, if they behave similar to we? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Internet periodical "Edge" are published for several years contributions of famous scientist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Does SPIEGEL ONLINE present consider selected answers in a series on the question "what you to be aware without being able to prove it?" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> I do not believe that animals have perceptions and other consciousness conditions, without that I or somebody otherwise this previously prove could where we once prove can that other persons have consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But in this case, we at least may hope because all human brains show the same basic configuration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> As soon as we turn to however other species and questions of the perceiving cut or very generally the consciousness, let's enter unwegsames terrain because the hardware does not agree. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> If a rat runs in danger, it does the same like many other animals: It stands dead, flees or grasps on. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Persons behave similarly wherefrom many scientists close on a comparable subjective experiencing. </seg>
<seg id="12"> On that I do not believe to be sure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Two aspects of the brain structure make it hard to transfer our subjective experiencing to that of animals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> To the one, the switching circuits associated almost always with the human consciousness close laughed since that prefrontal Cortex a (because of its participation in the short time memory and at the execution functions / control functions). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This wide region more highly is developed in humans much than at the remaining primates and seems to be absent from other creatures completely. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At least in those aspects of our consciousness, that depend on the prefrontal Cortex to decide under that the knowledge who we are, and the ability to plan and, exists therefore reason to the acceptance that the person differs even of the other primates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> A further dramatic singularity would be allowed to lie in the linguistic nature of the person: Because a so large part of its experiencing is connected with language, is named it often, the consciousness would hang therefrom off. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this case, one could exclude animals. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Yet also if consciousness would not depend on language, this certainly would influence it so that animal consciousness likes to procure be itself, how it also, probably very of that our consciousness would accrue would distinguish. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Therefore is to be determined heavily how consciousness likes to look at other animals. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If it yet neither measure itself, when something internal and subjective,, because of the special hardware, on the basis of our own experience analyze lets, places us its investigation before large problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> That of my executions have references to the contents of the aware experiencing, but there is beside it another further aspect of the consciousness that would be allowed to be scientifically more simply accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> One could examine happens the consciousness processes of animals without consideration on its contents, and exactly that in studies over the short time memory of primates, especially by the example of the visualization. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Yet in this extension, that Christof cook and Francis investigated cracked, one transfers himself sooner to the neural correlates of the consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: Both identically like to be or also not. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Interestingly enough this extension emphasizes also the meaning of the prefrontal Cortex for the realization of the visualization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> What arises now for the perceptions? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I would cut back it on that that an emotional system such as the brain aware the fear in one its own activity is activated. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What we designate as a "fear", is therefore the mental condition in which we find us, if the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, how physical reactions) memory covers. </seg>
<seg id="29"> So seen are perceptions closely at the regions the Cortex bound, that price primates and especially the person. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Connected with the linguistic nature, fine gradation of the perceiving arise because we can differentiate and categorize by means of the words and the grammar of conditions in order to attribute it next to us even also others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> On the other hand Antonio Damasio means follow for example, that perceptions out of more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the Cortex and the brain tribe similarly Jaak Pankseep that however more concentrates on the brain tribe. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Because this network in the course of the human evolution had not changed very, it could be involved thoroughly in gattungsÃ¼bergreifenden perceptions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Purely theoretically I cannot contradict that, consider it however to be unbeweisbar. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Pankseep argues, would feel, what would appear with rats and persons such as fear, probably also in both cases so on: How however could one review whether rats and persons perceive the same, if they similarly behave? </seg>
<seg id="35"> Does a Schabe escape in danger whether also it perceives fear? </seg>
<seg id="36"> In my eyes, bare behavior resemblance yet no Erlebensgleichheit can prove. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> To be sure the neural comparison helps further: Rats and persons have similar brain tribes, pushed on the other hand not once a brain. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Is the brain tribe but for perceptions responsible? </seg>
<seg id="39"> And even if one could prove that for the person: How did one want to prove it with rats? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Do I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even pushed (who knows?), perceptions have. </seg>
<seg id="41"> But I would not know how I should prove that. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And because its perceptions differ probably basically of that ours, (there the human consciousness on special switching circuits and on language rests), I investigate rather the emotional behavior than the emotional perceptions of rats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> In any case progress waves here on the neural plain as far as one measures the same with rats and persons. </seg>
<seg id="44"> How I do not investigate language and consciousness with rats, as well as not perceptions, knows I yet not whether they exist. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One likes to consider that to be short-sighted, but I come rather ahead to run than permanent against a wall. </seg>
<seg id="46"> I am even an emotional ware practical. </seg>

<seg id="2"> In the first half of the year 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the preceding year. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In Germany, flights became loud a current study even up to 50 percent cheaper. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> If flew and again more favorably became overnight stays in hotels - that is the result of a study of the trip service provider and finance service provider American express. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The business analyzed its entry data out of the first half year 2008 and assessed a clear break-in in the second quarter after an increasing of the prices in the first quarter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> After the prices climbed on the hotel market for years, the overnight stays in many places already reduced in price themselves. </seg>
<seg id="7"> From January to March, the prices in 41 of 48 climbed examined European cities yet around on the average 6.9 percent in comparison with 2007. </seg>
<seg id="8"> From April to June, the prices were however already around 3.6 percent lower than in the preceding year. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Most clearly the trend in Paris and Rome had been where travelers before pay must 30 to 37 percent fewer than a year. </seg>

<seg id="10"> As a cause for that American express sees the weak dollar rate that had led to a "decreasing wanderlust of American tourist". </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also finance places such as Frankfurt or London would be concerned more strongly of the decline of the hotel prices than locations of industry such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. </seg>

<seg id="14"> Because of the kerosene increase, travelers in the Economy class had to pay became on average 7.1 percent more than 2007, fuel intensive long-range flights even up to 29.2 percent more expensive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> From April to June, the prices sank were for flight tickets of the Economy class around on the average 12.5 percent in comparison with the preceding quarter, in the business that and First Class the price variations however by far slighter. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In Germany, the prices broke yet more strongly a than in other European countries: </seg>
<seg id="17"> From January to March, the prices had climbed around 11.9 percent, sank in the second quarter it around 23.6 percent. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In German domestic flights the prices even halved themselves according to the study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Let reason for the price break-in be on the one hand the diminishing economic growth, explains the business. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The demand in many segments of the flight trip market crumbles. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the other hand there are through that opuses-ski-come off, that liberalizes the air traffic between the USA and Europe, an increased competition pressure. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In this edition of the "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T discuss. Izumi the positions of the candidates to the bilingual education. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific colleague in Kalifonischen studies and leading director in the field development science at the Pacific Research institute for Public Policy, is thinks a co-author of the beech "not so well how one: Why the middle class of a school selection needs". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To address the hispanischen voters a complicated task is. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Barrack Obamas suggestions to the subject of development are a typical example for that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Obamas choice campaign mentioned is, to lock that "the probability in afro American and hispanischen students the school successfully, more low, than with white students" - what agrees. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In order to close this achievement distance, Obamas development plan recommends specially transition phase one bilingual under other in training for that, that first learn English. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Nevertheless the question exists be at Obama therein, whether use for the bilingual education, that puts the focal point on instruction in other languages as English, to reduce its interest contradicts, the distance in the school achievements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Let's take "Sixth street Prep", an elementary school in the eastern Los Angeles as an example. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Hispanisch are the majority of the student and come out of families with low income. </seg>
<seg id="11"> More than a third of the student, of which many are only recently in the country, learn English. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Nevertheless students of the fourth class insisted into 2008 astonishing 100 percent the country test in Mathe on a good level. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Also surprisingly 93 percent of the children became out of the fourth school year in the English test as good valued. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This astonishing success was reached with other methods when that that are preferred by Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The school Sixth street puts its focal point on examination and practice, on steady inspection of the knowledge and a bearing, that tolerates no exceptions. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The expanse practice the school the extension after which the education in an English language environment passes. Exact that is the point that Obama should note, so the school leader Linda Mikels. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This extension places importance on that almost Exclusively use of the English language in the specialty instruction. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Woman Mikels, that rejects the idea of bilingual education, said would have take place by means of to me, that a remarkable a student, who had come first shortly before that from Mexico, to school. One later would can entered 12 months the classroom and recognize it no longer. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "It functions", noticed in it, "it functions for us". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Would Obama take a school such as the "Sixth street Prep" as a model for other schools with large share in Latin American and other students learning English? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The achievements of the school easily would make the answer on this question, but the development political positions within its own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support already long the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of the bilingual education make predictions over Obamas answer uncertain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> While it agrees with the point, that immigrants should learn English, it has recently the subject of trivialisiert in that it noticed in, that persons should stop, worries over that on legislation aiming "only English" make itself. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Instead, it said: "You should guarantee that your child can" Spanish. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If Obama actually wants to close the achievement distance, it should consider carefully development models, that function instead of despising it and to trivialisieren. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia showed again why it many a consider to be the best long-range runner of all times, after he broke in the Berliner marathon on Sunday its own record and to the first person become is, who created the stretch of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved its prior results of 2:04:26 around 27 seconds, that it had reached last year in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Gebrselassie, 35, has sets up therewith its 26th world record in its multilateral career, in which it reached at least a world championship title on every stretch from a kilometer to the marathon or set up a world record. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Gebrselassie left out last month the Olympic marathon in Beijing, out of anxiety, that was exaggerated afterwards perhaps, that the air soiling could aggravate its asthma problems. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Instead he registered for the contest in Berlin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In almost ideal conditions - in sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees on target -, Gebrselassie with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds won per mile. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Since train runner such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat changed from Kenya on long-range, the record time is fell for marathon in the last 10 years around more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo won there Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> After its victory on Sunday Gebrselassie of the press announced, would have had it two weeks ago cramps in its calf and was not able to train therefore a week. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Obviously it is refreshed after recess and returned not on rusted. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It became for that criticizes - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia rival out of east Africa - that it excessively orchestrates its race courses, many world best marathon stars generally avoids, itself too very on the race leaders leaves as if that would be a train race, and places world records over the contest. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Yet this criticism damages the size Gebrselassies as a long-range runner hardly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Accompanied of four Kenyans on Sunday Gebrselassie had reached the midpoint of the stretch in 1:02:04. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi Gebrselassie have demands further after the speed makers had diminished. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Gebrselassie made something more than three miles before the Finish its last start in order to separate itself from Kwambai, that arrived as second in 2:05:36 and improved therewith its best time around almost 5 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Kamathi became third in 2:07:48. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The pride and the strain in life of the black population, in a city of the entirely special type </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hides between the outgrowths of the leisure time parks in the vicinity of Orlando, few miles of the glittering, loud and gigantic driving removes, lies a quiet city in which the pride and the complication of the Afro American culture to the light come. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home town Zora Neale Hurstons, is to be described did no longer so simply like Hurston it in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three KrocketplÃ¤tzen, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nowadays it is a pilgrim site. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby de are to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville come to remember around the most famous author of the Harlem renaissance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And nevertheless the city, that is and remains describes it â and that it to a tourist excursion goal made, in that it it in the Floridas guide included, that at present the depression of the federal author project produces became â in many regard a place of the entirely special sort. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Eatonville is not so independent, solid and privately like in the 1930ern when Hurston wrote, that rural black communities in Florida often refused to divide its true thoughts with the white man, that knows "so few over us, that he knows what it entgeht." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Even nowadays, in a year in that a black PrÃ¤sidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, to an open discussion about race ratios calls, are tired of it many here further to be observed of outsiders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "We very on that are considered like our story told becomes", so Hortense Jones, 59, from birth an inhabitant of the city and parishioner of the oldest church of the city. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It must agree." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Eatonville became long time as paradoxical the triumph and the battle defined. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is both is twice as high a historic example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, in that the poverty quota like the national average. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is on the one hand a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example of that - sometimes convicted, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south that has its roots in the American slavery. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is not surprisingly that inhabitants are here both proud and on the hat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And so correctly the objections began it around Eatonville's image actually with Zora how here all Hurston name. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It placed the world its home town in books before, that came of hearts and were written in dialect, so like "paint and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Five paragraphs in the Florida guide of changed the city, that lies entirely near the route 77, a street that through the often forgotten center Floridas leads, to the scenes of black story and human drama. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Impudent like Oskar both in the actual life and in the literature, Hurston reader led mayor, Joe Clarke, first to the store by Eatonvilles and turned then more private matters to. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "To one side of the street to the left", wrote it, "is that brown -knows painted modern school, with its cultivated gardens and playgrounds, around which itself always Howard Miller worries, although it do hardly read and write kann." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> It mentioned also the new man of widow Dash and wrote that lee Glenn "drinks of each type sells and what-also-always to hour rooms passt." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In only few hundred words Hurston connected therefore Eatonville with even government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This was very certainly no guide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In the deed, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> "Zora described the things so, how it were", so the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the maggots the Hurston immortalized in that it the men quoted, who sang songs over that its beauty, that were full sexual allusion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It added: "Many people disliked this." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> One remembers here still Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin, that regularly returned, after its family was pulled to Jacksonville, Florida. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that if Hurston came into the city gebraust, it this usually without warning did, clothes in a making noise Chevrolet, smoking and with pairs of pants, imagines that in a city even today something on its venerable clothing style. </seg>
<seg id="28"> According to Mr. Franklin, most inhabitants were fascinated whereas many of they despised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "The people were always happily Zora to see", said Mr Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But "it remained too long", it never joined swung thereto during it in its chair, on a terrace lain to the rear, that looks at the Sabelia lake, in which Hurston was baptized according to all probability. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As Hurston in 1960 died was it poor and its books assaulted. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Together with the large part of the world, Eatonville seemed forgotten it to have. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although she was once a famous author, a time comrade Langstin Hughes and the single black woman at the bar Ard College in the 1920ern, was buried it in fort Pierce, Florida where she lived, in an anonymous grave. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In Eatonville, there was no large commemorative celebration, no public reading on a large scale. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "I think, that it its contribution in the world or its heir in the slightest understood have", so Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography over Hurston the 2003 published became not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The turning point came in the '80's. </seg>
<seg id="37"> County authorities orange wanted to put a fÃ¼nfspurige freeway through the city in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow zweispurige main street of the community. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Orlandos suburbs had pressed already the freeway 4 through the western outskirts. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The suggestion became submits when Eatonville recovered yet always of a difficult phase in its story. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Compulsion integration, among other things, had set the relatively idyllic isolation of the community an end. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In the '50's the battle against race mixture hate brought into the partnership. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "In this time came often a pile of white boys and it threw orange and thing on that to one side of sitting people", said Mr. Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="43"> "There was killed became even once a woman that at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="44"> They threw a water melon out of the car." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> In 1955, Hurston examined in one write to the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the waiter court to force integration in that it designated its decision in the case Brown against the schools inspector as "insulting instead of my race respecting". </seg>
<seg id="46"> Inhabitants say nowadays that although the lifting of the race separation in many a regard was positive, it that the group consistency in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth weakened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> "Black children were it accustoms, embraced to become - I remind one me on that - one embraced its teacher of the morning and one embraced its teacher in the evening", so N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the public-spirited group to the protection of the Eatonville partnership. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> That uprightly could be received so long, joined it thereto until teacher and student came no longer out of the same place. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "One embraced its white teacher not, for he was a white teacher - I my there is a cultural crevice available", said woman Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> However the civil rights contributed in addition that place was created for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actor and artist who disregarded prejudices, so how it did it, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How someone can deny herself the joy of my company! </seg>
<seg id="51"> I do not understand it." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In 1975, the author got going grave of nameless Alice Walker to Hurstons and began to fight for the revitalization of its renown. </seg>
<seg id="53"> A much praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway in the bookshelves later was to be found five years, and it made again to a part of the American literature canon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> The distance street project came exactly at one time, in which Eatonvilles stood most famous daughter again once in the light of the public. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Hurstons saw and this time old neighbors it as a rescuer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> The community began to show festivals in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston over what the district with the building of the freeway could destroy. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Thousands of fans came to the ErÃ¶ffnungsevent two years later, and many turn every January for the celebration back. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> A few years later the district of its street blueprints turned away itself. </seg>
<seg id="59"> "The plans of a fÃ¼nfspurigen distance street of animated the city, accelerated the entire with top speed, woke real citizen pride", said woman Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Woman Boyd expressed it somewhat more simply: "Zora rescued Eatonville." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> The victory against the distance street project contributed to a variation of the even picture of the city. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Came began more and more train trip, so like avenge yard Munson, a lawyer, that has gone since 1993 here into the church, and domestic to appreciate the past newly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Eatonville was included 1998 in the nationwide historic index. </seg>
<seg id="64"> A new single-story library (naturally after Hurston named) opened in 2006 on the new paved and brightened up Kennedy Boulevard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> Nowadays Eatonville is as always a peculiarity in Florida: she can feel established became herself only 6 miles of the city center Orlandos sometimes like a rear lane in the summer rain, so small like at that time as it by only 27 black families in the 1880ern. </seg>
<seg id="66"> (You is nowadays to 90% black). </seg>
<seg id="67"> Outside in search of the story Eatonvilles and its meaning are treated often still with caution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> For most interviews, a permission in the forefield is not may be photographed necessary and certain things - so like the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles of oldest church, that of a white painted became and black men in the field work represents -. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> Many in Eatonville, like woman Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a predeliction for dark red, fear still that its shielded partnership is misunderstood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> And nevertheless, to the same time to that the Hurston festival larger became, was born also an increased degree at homeland pride. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Above all young persons tend saw in addition to see Eatonville so like Hurston its total race: beautifully, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proudly, creatively and diligently, foolishly and mixes through like each other race group and people group in America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> It is hear can the honest love to this city that one in the voice of Mr. Franklins nephew, utilize could the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, that to return has before after the College after Eatonville, in order to work in the city administration or at the police, that loud it something aid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73"> And even the boys, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins out of winter park, learned to describe Eatonville correctly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> "Most people who pass through only here, will think: "Alas, this city is nothing in comparison with all the other", said Alondra Kenon recently at a Sunday after the church. </seg>
<seg id="75"> "But if one actually stops and a moment long its story observes, is it a very beautiful city." </seg>

That is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with approximately 15 million Euro investment for the filming. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In this manner the Cineast tried to represent `eine quantity of personalities and social analysis', what it had admired always at the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today in the presentation of the film with Quim GutiÃ©rrez and Paula EchevarrÃ­a at the beginning of a long index of the performer. </seg>
<seg id="4"> `Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, is presented this Friday in movie theaters and shown later on the transmitter Telemadrid than a four hour mini series. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> JosÃ© Luis Garci, large fan of the literature of GaldÃ³s, assures that thanks to this filming its `Kindheitstraum went' in fulfillment. It has this Esperanza Aguirre to owe, that delegated it three years ago of the autonomous partnership Madrid, to turn a commemorative film to the second century celebration on the 2nd of November in Madrid.

<seg id="7"> However the Cineast regrets that one was not able to reckon with the financing such as in `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice so highly as in `Sangre de mayo'), therefore some scenes could not be turned out of the script with Horacio ValcÃ¡rcel, with which Garci collaborated almost its entire career. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For this reason, has Garci, that also film director in `Volver a empezar was', through its usual mode of operation co-operated: he stood first rehearse must on the stage to the actors, with which one before one to turn begins and for that, that had made no Casting, appear he `demÃ¼tigend' and respect providing to perform `ein part of the occupation of the film director exists therein, aid in the theater and in the movie theater What in the movie theater industry, in which one works, geschieht.' </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he one won has), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates, that represent this year Spain before the Academy of Hollywood, represents, a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Neither `Sangre de mayo', yet `Siete mesas de billar francÃ©s' and in the end also not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For this film, Garci expects no honors. </seg>

<seg id="1"> For the Olympic games, the streets in Madrid are deficient. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, the dream of many of us is, to arrange some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, can be it yet perhaps 2016. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But I ask me: `Sind we for that before ready?' </seg>
<seg id="4"> Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it does not agree! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It was designated as a perfect street, and my judgment after, was was it the worst street with all drum and at it, that there. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Naturally the one quantity of nonsense is if one would note the estimation and I could test it, would be so what unambiguously not come through. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But, let's go through from the beginning all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The nonsense begins with the Ticketholen, that permits you to go firster. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It seems to be also not badly to me, but if they let already advance you, they should give you also everything (inclusive chips, around the obstructions on the street to avoid). </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore yet not. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Here they let get you only the ticket (the first nonsense, that therein exists, only therefore there to go) and (after an endless queue) there the surprise is! There was the T Shirt only in the size `S' (a second nonsense, because I the size XL would need) </seg>
<seg id="12"> Where shall we live then actually? </seg>
<seg id="13"> Is it or decided became so, that after the crisis only small to buy much cheap shirt out of less material? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Therefore well, things how this are a trifle in comparison with the days on the street. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Seen therefrom that one very early must go in order to get the chip, is there already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, must lie let one the knapsack. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The waiting lasted more than 35 minutes, is incomprehensible what in the case of a street where 11,000 persons expected become. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the end, how it was to be expected also, the street did not begin and we had our back sacks before that lie let, also to get if it was arrive once, but it back would be already more hard. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Moreover it looked, in these 40 minutes wait after rain so that it came to the temptation to organize a people uprising and to attack the cottage. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I believe, mornings will have certainly some 500 persons pneumonia and will appear some how I because of this chip, that I got, not once on time at the classification, I already can think myself that the exit incorrectly was stamped. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Obviously, if one would ask me about a perfect street, this street never would occur to me. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So I believe will dream, we yet long of a city, that is prepared for the Olympic games well </seg>

<seg id="1"> Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On the `Emerging Technology Conference', would arrange of WITH, introduced Microsoft the progress of the new picture recognition system and the person interaction, order a being of the artificial intelligence without much intelligence which is capable however to settle some primitive tasks, like for example a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft is that a route plan, around itself on the campus of the business to move). The system notes that what hears it during the support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Thanks to a camera and a form system and face recognition system, this `Rezeptionistin can recognize' how many persons are in the room, who they are and remember even, how they were clothed, it can listen and understand the keywords of its support. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It can incorporate also the presents after the conversations into the groups. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the presentation video, `die Rezeptionistin notes' a third person, but she understands that this person to the group who leads with its conversation is not, accompanying, and that also no firm employee is. </seg>
<seg id="6"> It inquires whether the person wants and answers visit here someone, that she will listen soon. </seg>
<seg id="7"> All without the blue Screenshot </seg>
<seg id="8"> Impressively </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> That is certainly the future. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Now the business has things better on which it can concentrate, for example on the next version of its operating system windows. </seg>
<seg id="11"> One spoke this week very superficially over the change of strategy about Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Windows 7 more quickly will be and will have not so many bound programs. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Steve Ballmer assessed that if the computers would be equipped with the most necessary instead of filling it with the commercial rubbish, five times more quickly would function it. Person, Steven, that will be only for the few. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Everything is only a determination if one considers, that Microsoft in windows added versions one or function and `Extras' to other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The direction change is worthwhile </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Microsoft lost right, the operating system gradually at meaning, exactly like the software. </seg>
<seg id="17"> When Googles appear to chrome in the network, that was a part of the theory that it would be the first step of Google in order to compete with windows. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Sent showed many on that there that the browser is no operating system. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The operating system when a part indispensable, will be always necessary so that hardware and software simultaneously can function. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The operating system fulfills the function, that can be compared to the function of its wife or its husband, if it goes therefore to announce its mother-in-law something. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> That agrees. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The system never will disappear, but one must not at its `Tod', as an absolute, but rather as a relative truth, think. </seg>
<seg id="23"> What said this week to Ballmer, is the confirmation of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The persons give each time less attention the operating system, for that more the Web browser. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The computer only is started in order to carry out the Firefox, the explorer or chrome and every day spend we more time at the surfing, than in the environment of the `Fenster'. </seg>
<seg id="26"> For what does the half in the computer of available uses serve? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Fewer is more </seg>
<seg id="28"> And windows 7 must be compacter, much compact than a Vista. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Easier, not so exaggerated, complicates fewer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The interest of Microsoft it exists more therein to integrate its Online services, that can become then in the end the alternative Google. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the reality, they need that, without doubt. I bring a small example for that. </seg>
<seg id="32"> I have the photo of this place in speech moon, made employee in one of the recovery room for Microsoft at the beginning of the month. </seg>
<seg id="33"> On the refreshment drink vending machine, a sign is secured: `Deine search. Our future'. It prints out a favor to use own tool for Online search. </seg>
<seg id="34"> In 2006, an independent study to the end came that that 66% the employee used with Microsoft, Google for the investigation in the network. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> By the way, last week was confirmed also that the new version of the windows ran mobile 7 in the delay. </seg>
<seg id="36"> It will not appear originally, but rather end 2009, sooner even 2010. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Microsoft seeks the possibility to bring windows 7 and windows mobile 7 simultaneously on the marks. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Every day the telephone in a computer changes itself. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> There is no single reason that this appearance causes. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Often are sought connections with other appearances in the sleep, gives like nightmares, panic-stricken anxiety at night, Enuresis noctura (bed wetnesses at night), speaking in the sleep sought, but it no reason for that. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Conference - of the blood that again certain became </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hema Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine DÃ©cary, had herself all reason to please, for Hema Quebec became one of the most certain and most efficient blood banks of the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And above all it recovered the confidence of the public, that heavily had been shaken through the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980 and '1990's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> How one knows, the blood reserves administered national by the blood donation service the Canadian Red Cross had contaminated during the '1980's with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In view of this drama and the discontent of the public, the government of Canada initiated in February 1994 a public investigation led by the judge Horace Krever, that had as a goal of bringing light into the circumstances, that had led to such a tragedy, and guidelines to prepare, around a renewed catastrophe of this type to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While judge Krever yet hesitated to deliver its report, several provinces placed at that time a committee on the legs whose goal it was of developing a new system to the administration of stored blood in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In Quebec, the committee GÃ©lineau fulfilled this order. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the reports of GÃ©lineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema Quebec that is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company in order to furnish the other provinces and both territories. </seg>
<seg id="9"> `1998 when Hema Quebec received its work, had hardly 38% of the people confidence into the stored blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. DÃ©cary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was discouraging. </seg>
<seg id="11"> To improve through the enormous exertions around the security of the stored blood and through the work on this zone during the following years, we recovered the confidence of the public', say it before it emphasizes proudly, that beginning 2008 had meanwhile almost 94% of the population of Quebec confidence in Hema Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Dr. DÃ©cary retains is however in the consciousness, that `Vertrauen somewhat extremely fragile'. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since its foundation on the 28th of September 1998, Hema Quebec acts after the principle of the caution. </seg>
<seg id="14"> To this time of experienced we the appearance of numerous cases of the human form mad cow disease in Europe with, a new type of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-illness, tells this woman, that has in the direction since the foundation 1998. </seg>
<seg id="15"> `Und we had not the slightest premonition whether this illness could be transmitted over the blood. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Therefore we referred to one of the head guidelines of the reports of Krever and GÃ©lineau, that according to one from end measures uses, if one does not know this and if an illness only slowly advances, how it is obviously in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob-illness the case, that expresses itself through a degeneration of the brain, what leads inevitable to death. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore one supposed in April 1999 no blood of persons, that had stayed since 1980 more long than a month in the united kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Now, some years ago was proved without any doubt that this illness is transmitted over the blood. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So showed us this event that the principle of the caution that we used has, thoroughly a sense. </seg>
<seg id="20"> 1999 appear a much more exact technology to the recognition of HIV on the market: The nucleic acids tests (NST), that it do not enable to prove directly in the blood of the donor the occurrence of the virus itself, and that of the antibody against the virus how it was in the previously related tests the case. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The NST of enabled it that to shorten incubation time, that between the moment, to which the person was infected and that if the first viruses by our technologies in the blood proved will can, takes place, explains the specialist. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This time could be reduced on a duration by less than a week. </seg>
<seg id="23"> So the risk became not that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one this recognize could, diminishes substantially. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These improvements of enabled it, that risk to transmit, AIDS over a blood transfusion, to sink in considerable mass. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Nowadays runs one of 12 million persons danger to receive infected blood with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="26"> `Mit other words is named that that one would have to distribute 12 million stored blood, before someone would be infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Because Hema Quebec distributes each year between 400,000 and 500,000 stored blood, it would last more than 24 years before a case appears, with which HIV became transmit over a stored blood. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I believe that one probably can feel nowadays at the same time, if one gets or prescribes a blood transfusion to restore around the health', mean the direction boss of Hema Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It that to receive security of our products is `Unsere challenge for the next ten years. </seg>
<seg id="30"> One never knows, which pathogen can arrive into the system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Not until the past year the Chikungunya virus emerged on the island RÃ©union, that just as the west Nile virus is transmitted, by insects over the blood. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We uninterruptedly must supervise', go Dr. DÃ©cary away before it emphasizes, that Hema Quebec must make available a sufficient provision next to a certain provision moreover. </seg>
<seg id="33"> `Der requirement climbs because the population ages. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Because the treatments to the cancer fight are more aggressive, the patients need often new red blood bodies or blood platelet. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The over aging of the population affects also the blood donor network, to which in the average only 3% of the inhabitant of Quebec suitable to the blood donation belong. ' </seg>
<seg id="36"> At the same time every healthy person, who more old is 18 years or and fulfills the fitness criteria, every 56 days, therefore six times per year can, contribute blood. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In the average are not supposed 14% of the persons, that make available its blood, because they became ill for example with AIDS or malaria, and who traveled into a country, in which malaria is spread, becomes for a year of the blood donation excluded. </seg>
<seg id="38"> We create `Mit this 3% it to receive an inventory, that corresponds to the needs of the hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Lacking supplies are very rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But one must renew the members of this donor network if they more old can become and can contribute no more blood. </seg>
<seg id="41"> It is to be held heavily to convince the people, to contribute, above all however, blood it and to bring it in addition, to become regular donors. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Life is nowadays so hectically that one finds rarely the time to spend an hour in the blood donation', regrets Francine DÃ©cary. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With a year budget of 297 million dollars, Hema Quebec delivers not only stored blood, but rather also human tissues, under that bone transplants, heart lids, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively in heavy fire injuries. </seg>
<seg id="44"> These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored between in Hema Quebec, that also the single public navel cord of blood bank Quebec administers. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In the navel cord, that was observed earlier than a biomedical refuse, rich blood that can serve in addition is at stem cells, heavy illnesses, like for example leukemia, to treat. </seg>
<seg id="46"> We celebrated `Vor some weeks the deposit of our thousandth navel cord blood sample, and we plan to decrease annually more than thousand. </seg>
<seg id="47"> `Wir should begin probably beginning next year therewith to make available it for transplantation', explains decrease describes Dr. DÃ©cary further, that this program of the Nabelschnurblut- than very popularly. </seg>

<seg id="10"> Although it was mentioned recently frequently in the speeches of the prime minister, the opening of the north - the northern zone on the 49sten latitude - never subject of a presentation had been. </seg>
<seg id="11"> To explain the prime minister restricted themselves however on that why the north would be `ein jewel with enormous potential', no date, no investment sums or exact priorities named however for the coming projects. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At most some outlooks on that on what more could be worked: Above all at the water energy, at the forest, but especially at the mining sector, favors through the growth of the threshold countries and the renewal of the public infrastructures. </seg>

<seg id="19"> `Dies is a traditional bearing that all governments pursued. </seg>

<seg id="32"> This was by the way one of the subjects turned-up again and again of the weekend that was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the acceptance the party leadership by Jean Lesage. </seg>
<seg id="33"> One of the supposed decisions plans to rename the power plant of Beauharnois in AdÃ©lard-Godbout-obstruction dam. </seg>

<seg id="38"> The prime minister who said in April, that it would give 2008, and certainly also 2009, no choices, did not exclude in the deed the possibility to hold off this autumn a choice, what is possible it of the law here, yet. </seg>
<seg id="39"> It emphasizes that its appointment calendar is full however, above all because of a mission of the partnership advice in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The general meeting of the weekend provided the liberal party chief a platform out of nationalistic plans, above all out of `die constitution relevant goals', that were supposed readily: The PLQ demands very especially the recognition of the `Besonderheit of Quebec' in the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="41"> It would like also that Quebec of members of the advice appoints the Canadian broadcast and telecommunications, and that these possess a veto regarding that in Quebec gefÃ¤llten decisions. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The single government, that in spite of the fact that Canada the Genevans convention signs has, its word breaks and vegetate there lets a child soldier under inhuman conditions. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Free opinion - the orwellsche speech of Barrick gold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In its edition of the 17th of September, Le Devoir published a letter of Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice general director of the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms, and an orwellsche logic pursues strove for, with the goal, to open at the same time, that the largest gold winning company of the world a slander complaint over six million against three authors and a small destitute publishing house a `Ã¶ffentliche transparent debate'. </seg>
<seg id="4"> If it agrees, that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge over the truth, above all not in the case of slander complaints, but rather over the law. </seg>
<seg id="5"> How expects, this basic difference was concealed of Mr. Garver totally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> For for Barrick gold, the best type is to be led a public debate to drive every into the ruin, that ventures it to represented one of that its opposed opinions. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Very same, how the process goes out, the authors and the publisher of the beech Noir Canada considerable sums will have to issue in order to prepare its defense and to fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers, that are paid out of the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The tactic in these unequal fights is in the remaining often to ruin the defenders, in order to force an amicable regulation, that makes the opposite side mouth dead and deters moreover everyone, that it ventures to concern itself again with the question. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If Barrick gold wanted really a public debate, it should have presented its visibility of the things before the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In contrast to that, what in many of the countries, in which Barrick gold works, perfectly acceptable is, debates become not in Canada normally through the exchange of ideas and through club blows expedited. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It would have sufficed therefore if the gold mine would have disclosed its books and acts and would have opened an actual debate, through which newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams, that would have been able to bring light into this question. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But Barrick gold seems to have no confidence into the public opinion and wipes the petition and letters to the support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement aside. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Could Mr. Garver explain perhaps how he can ask simultaneously for a `Ã¶ffentliche' debate and at the same time yet the opinions neglect just this public? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apparently comprised this word in the world of the vice president only the generously paid lawyers, and not the partnership of all Canadian; an entirely quite cramped visibility manner of the concept. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy, even Verleumder are right the to speak. </seg>
<seg id="16"> What - or not not understand wants - is understands Barrick gold, that the public, that the authors and publisher of Noir Canada supports, does, this above all therefore, because it rejects the brutal bearing of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This public is not civilized perceive arranged in addition ready to listen and to judge Barrick, but on the basis one exchange of arguments, and in a frame, that many as a gag complaint (in the course of the `Ã¶ffentlichen debate' Barrick gold just a demand on the authors of Noir Canada, in whom it demands by them to use this concept no longer. ..). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Apart from the surrealen speech of Mr. Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct attack on the freedom to the academic research and the establishment of the truth that are basic for each democratic society. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It denies totally the right to quote plausible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, that form the basis of the intellectual work. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Is if it impossible in a country such as Canada not please to investigate and to discuss subjects, that the rich businesses of this world, can do who otherwise that then? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If Barrick gold wanted really a public and transparent debate, it could lead this in that it follows the scientific standards, that were used by the authors of Noir Canada. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It is right a to answer. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The university background to which we belong, knows for some time to get debates and inconsistencies into the handle and to solve conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold shows clearly that it has, in contrast to that, what purports it, no desire on a transparent debate. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is a loss for the university world just as for the public debate, and it time becomes that the governments seize measures, that restrict this type of unjustified complaints. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Rescue operation for the Wall Street - democrats and republican understand itself </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The administration Bush and the leading congresswomen, republican and democrats likewise, came yesterday finally to a unification over the most extensive economy rescue plan since the large depression of the '30's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The new version of the plan over 700 billion U.S. dollars that should stop the finance crisis, that already since months the Wall Street shaken, must be supposed yet by both congress chambers. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The head contents are: A better inspection of the delegate over the practical use of the plan, new mechanisms in order to secure the repayment of the used public moneys, new decrees in order to dam the amount of the houses seized on the basis of payment residues, as well as the right to supervise the salaries, that are paid at the leading employees of the supported businesses. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The American finance secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the delegate chamber Nancy Pelosi, and the representative present in the negotiations of the republican, senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, some minutes after midnight, the good novelty, after a two-day negotiation marathon. </seg>
<seg id="6"> `Wir made large progress toward a unification, becomes that market effective its', explained the representative of the administration Bush, Henry Paulson. </seg>
<seg id="7"> `Es happened all to protect around which real economy and the American people against the course crisis at the Wall Street', explained the democrat. </seg>
<seg id="8"> `Dies is the basic point: If we do not do that, become the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in the daily life of the American be enormous', explained the republican Judd Gregg. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The negotiations had sped up during the last two hours, out of fear of the effect, that would have had a renewed failure on the mood of the investors. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The time period that had been arranged was the market opening today morning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Both American presidency candidate, who were involved first late in the negotiations, appeared sooner than an advocate of the unification without neglecting however, to express its discontent about that that one had to encounter it in this extreme manner. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The democratic senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain decrees to the unification, above all such, that should enable it the owners to retain its houses, and such that concern the salaries of the leading employees of the business rescued by the country. </seg>
<seg id="13"> `Wenn one the taxpayers therefore asks to seize based on the irresponsibility of certain persons extraordinary measures, is that nothing why one could congratulate himself. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But these measures are necessary', explained it on the American television stations. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When it was asked on one other transmitter, whether it will agree for the proposed plan, its republican opponent John McCain answered: `Ich would know gladly first the details, but I hope it. </seg>
<seg id="16"> `Die guiding principles that I read that this is a thing, that we will have to digest everyone, and with that we will be able to make headway. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The option to do nothing at all, is very simply not acceptable', said it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The 700 billions of dollar plan is aligned on that, with the money of the taxpayer </seg>
<seg id="19"> It comes 14 months after a crisis, through which bursting of a real estate bubble released, that led first of all to the breakdown of the very risky mortgage credit (Subprime), before they expanded (PCAA) itself on further forms more common loans, and flowed in the end into a freezing of the financial power and into the ruin of the banks and money institutes. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It, that let fail last week the first attempt to the unification, was a group of republican delegate. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Since the democrats accepted, that certain `giftige are supposed to be secured and not bought' assets of the companies in oppression only by the government, one believes escape himself the dead end. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In order to round off the points of view for all in the congress, one added also a decree, raise could that purports that, if the government with this program should make losses within five years, it then new taxes in order to get back so its used capital. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The new plan plans the payment of a first sum of 250 billions, to which further 100 billions can arrive, if the president looks at it for compel. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The payment of further 350 billions must be dismissed in a renewed voting by the congress. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In return for its aid, Washington receives sell can shares in the supported businesses, that bring in it in the case of profits dividends, and that it again if the storm is pulled past. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Federal Government will have the possibility, the seizure procedures regarding the dwellings, that are tied to the real estate credit concerned by this plan, to delay, and to fix moreover time periods for the repayment and the settlements, that are paid at the leading employees of the concerned businesses. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The developers of the plan would have it gladly that the delegate chamber votes already today over it, and the senate then on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In spite of all its efforts is not certain yet that its plan will get green light. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Actually further voices against this intention raised themselves yesterday, both of sides of the republican and the democrats. </seg>
<seg id="30"> `Ganz obviously does not understand us Washington', explained the republican Scott Garett, member of the finance commission of the chamber, its voters. </seg>
<seg id="31"> `Ja, we have a large financial problem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Yes, there are solutions. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But not that that exists therein to ask the taxpayers to the cash register'. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The democratic delegate Brad Sherman, leader of a group in the congress, who is named `der Kaukus of the skeptic', represents the things differently, comes however to the same conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Economy professors excellent `Vierhundert, under that three noble prize winners, wrote us in order to announce us to: We ask is the congress to not to be pressured, and to consider carefully, to hit which way', explained it yesterday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> To the same time, we got the proof in Europe again that it concerns a worldwide crisis. </seg>

<seg id="10"> It was born 1925 in Ohio as a son of a German Jew and a Hungarian sturdy mother. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Out of its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream should emerge. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature. </seg>
<seg id="13"> For in it, an entire country reflected itself again, that in the Self-maggots-one was fallen in love, into the fighter, who was injured in the Pacific war in the combat, that beginning of the 50 visited years drama in Yale studied and the Actor's it studios in New York then, before he had success at the theater, on television and soon also in the movie theater. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Just this man who fought for the civil rights was also the driver, that 1979 became in the 24-Stunden-Rennen 24-Stunden-Rennen hour 24-Stunden-Rennen race of Mans second, and moreover a sex symbol although he has lived together with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a show relation. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw it, without humor, when living challenge at the `Underplaying', when he did not judge its all too print out strong achievements. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, that the rolls flyed long time only so. </seg>

<seg id="1"> What became produced into the calculation factory of extra charge &amp; Co.? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On the 8th of October, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against JÃ¡nos extra charge and its accomplices begin. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Especially the participation in the organized crime is reproached the accused, as well as coarsely careless damage and business fraud, and other punishable offenses - among other things document forgery -. </seg>
<seg id="4"> According to district attorney's office, that were used out of the announcements lukrierten means for own purposes, attained covers became achievements during that often with falsified calculations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> National moneys and subsidies of the autonomy - altogether HOOVES 65 Mio - are supposed to have flowed partly into the cash registers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private cash registers more single. </seg>
<seg id="6"> How the issuing authorities announced, fictional calculations were produced in the relating of the announcement moneys, and the societies not also are supposed to be come later its duties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to accusation writing, a large part of the calculations should have been falsified. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The calculation blocks were bought at the market of JÃ³zsefvÃ¡ros, one let prepare the round seals in Kiskunhalas. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The decision about that, on which firms the calculations are supposed to be issued, was decided on that round trip north of the disk lake, on which IstvÃ¡n Lados was sent by JÃ¡nos extra charge. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the train of this "reconnaissance tour", Lados pension and restaurants foundly should make. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It demanded calculations over the Konsumationen in order to be able to issue later on these models being based calculations for the youth ministry and sport ministry, that socially and Department of Labor, as well as the autonomy of Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="12"> These calculations should have been manipulated by a majority by IstvÃ¡n Lados and its accomplice, AndrÃ¡s whereby more latter after our information for the constitution of the corresponding reports been responsible be should. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> One of the goals of Lados' "reconnaissance tour" was a beer local. </seg>
<seg id="14"> How two of extra charge and Co in 2003 issued calculations is to be taken, the gastronomy business should have the ninety headed group of the society Biztos Pont EgyesÃ¼let bewirtet. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Now the boss of the business does not give away locally would have fit however on, a so large group all at once in that. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Another calculation, issued in the summer 2002 on the foundation Jobb later well known as an EgyÃ¼tt a Harmadik ÃvezredÃ©rt, showed also serious form mistakes and contents mistakes. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, that controls solely three rooms and not simultaneously can harbor more than ten persons, should have stayed according to calculation of 130 guests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The imagination of the calculation counterfeiter no boundaries were set obviously just as when it concerned the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy business in whose accounting documents of the customers seem up Jobb and HoppÃ¡ according to accusation authority not at all first. </seg>
<seg id="19"> How manager Farkas of the hvg. hu announced, was immediately clearly that it concerned falsified documents, to it when it by the district attorney's office during an inquiry documents were produced. </seg>
<seg id="20"> "Our firm name and the tax number incorrectly were mounted" on the stamp. </seg>
<seg id="21"> And further: Apart from irregularities, also the fact was incorrectly that the business one hundred persons should have harbored, after they have altogether eleven rooms, that offer place to impossibly so many persons. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Also provisions had been on the calculation cited, would be there the restaurant for some time time no longer in operation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The busy calculation counterfeiters neglected also, to review that the Budapester travel agency taken by them into the visor offers excluding trips abroad, and so they indicated Hungary trips on the bar payment calculation, what contradicted the Rechnungslegungspraxis of the firm also. </seg>
<seg id="24"> How in the course of the ascertainments well known became, they cited in addition on the calculations also the value-added tax although travel agency achievements, that have references to a country outside of the EU, are, value-addedtax-free. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The height of the value-added tax was altogether on four of the hotel RÃ©vfÃ¼lÃ¶p Kft. at the foundation Jobb issued calculations incorrect because the business reckons instead of 25 only 15 percent sales tax, moreover become of the colleagues exclusively machine calculations issued, the falsified documents were however handwritten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> A further mistake, that was slip in the "Rechnungslegern", was that, that it in a case "its carrier" than attained achievement indicated had although this is not offered by the firm specialized on Investmentberatung, divided the district attorney's office with. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Further irregularities - incorrect calculation format, incorrect stamp - was to be owed that that at EgyÃ¼tt a Harmadik ÃvezredÃ©rt AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny, as well as at XXI. SzÃ¡zadi KulturÃ¡lis EgyesÃ¼let and Biztos Pont issued calculations as a forgery exposed become could. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Just as in the case the Ravenna Bt. and the sport warehouse KunfehÃ©rtÃ³ whose managers assured to never to have issued the calculations. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Another "mistake" is the counterfeiters in that HAD Kft. out of NyÃ­regyhÃ¡za slip in: This company was at present (2001) namely just in solution when the group of the Fiatal VÃ¡rosÃ©rt EgyesÃ¼let should have eaten there - the mass administrator gave consequently on to not to have issued the calculations themselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Deliberately falsified </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Persons who was thoroughly aware are the other group of the Rechnungsleger, that they would have to put fictional calculations. </seg>
<seg id="32"> On requesting of the Fiatal Baloldal - the foundation EsÃ©ly BudapestÃ©rt AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny calculations issued IfjÃº SzocialistÃ¡k for the foundation EgyÃ¼tt a Harmadik ÃvezredÃ©rt, in a height of about HOOVES 4 million. </seg>
<seg id="33"> According to accusation writing, the manager of the Collab Kft was persuaded. of one of the accused, Ludovic GyÃ¶rfi, to the display of the fictional calculations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The Biogate Kft present momentarily also in liquidation. should have collaborated also with extra charge and Co. : In 2003, the gmbh should have furnished the foundation Jobb AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny, as well as the societies Atlasz EgyesÃ¼let and EgyesÃ¼let with falsified calculations in the total value of HOOVES 5 million, attained related itself that on not achievements. </seg>
<seg id="35"> There was however just as little payment traffic because the calculations were cancelled directly after its display, what the concerned in its documents to note forgotten have however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The third group of the Rechnungsleger comprises persons who are connected directly with the accused. </seg>
<seg id="37"> IvÃ¡n Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta TriÃ³ Kft., one in Budapest of resident is one of them, there however not detectable fuel firm and vehicle trade firm. </seg>
<seg id="38"> This firm should have issued several calculations in the period from October to December 2005 over the sale of EDP components in the total value of HOOVES about 18 million. </seg>
<seg id="39"> According to issuing authority, the cash present since the 14th of September 2005 in liquidation Investment Kft should have functioned. out of Kiskunhalas as a buyer of these calculations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Manager of this firm was a Rumanian, whom the firm documents should be delivered also by IvÃ¡n Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. </seg>
<seg id="41"> After our information, Kubatov stood during the ascertainments, issued calculations in the name of the gmbh. at the societies Atlasz and HoppÃ¡, as well as at EgyÃ¼tt a Harmadik ÃvezredÃ©rt AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny and to have collected its value itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The firms Fa Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos Investment Bt. should have been established by Romanian masons on IvÃ¡n Kubatovs specific wish there. </seg>
<seg id="43"> In truth however was no these firms active, what lay according to accused at lacking orders. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Nevertheless it was able to profit from the businesses: On requesting of its accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, that was delegated with the preparation of the firm foundation documents, he issued in the name of the firms calculations at the societies brought with extra charge in connection, like about at Atlasz and Y GenerÃ¡ciÃ³. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Altogether Kubatov should have issued 15 calculations in the total value of HOOVES 14.2 million in the name of the firms cash Investment, Delta TriÃ³, Fa Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade at the organizations. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The district attorney's office assumes that Kubatov of respectively 10% the calculation sum as well as the value-added tax could have collected. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Kubatov should have abused even the firm Szi Beri Bt. for the display of fictional calculations - in this case were enclosed the calculations the applications of Biztos Pont. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> The firm Y GenerÃ¡ciÃ³ and SzÃ¶vetsÃ©g a in a modern manner MagyarorszÃ¡gÃ©rt in January 2006 delivered its application in the public-spirited organization of the socialistic party, TÃ¡ncsics MihÃ¡ly AlapÃ­tvÃ¡ny ("TMA"). </seg>
<seg id="49"> Both received 500,000 Forint apiece, utilized these sums however purpose alienated. </seg>
<seg id="50"> In order to gloss over this, they have cause produced the TMA five fictional calculations of that team Kft.. </seg>
<seg id="51"> These calculations were guaranteed by the way in the search of the office of ÃrpÃ¡d Kemecsei in the instruction ministry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In the negotiations becomes now of some accused with an admission over the procedure of the calculation forgery how they were discarded already before the district attorney's office, calculated. </seg>
<seg id="53"> A sensation could be if the head accusation JÃ¡nos extra charge to a comprehensive admission decides. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Its previous statements were detailed namely fewer, and although it had accepted already repeatedly to report comprehensively over all, stands its admission yet from. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The question remains therefore openly whether this lies in its interest, whether the socialists locked a pact with it regarding the reparation of the large part of the emerged damage of HOOVES 50 million, and whether extra charge is in return ready to accept the responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="56"> It is however thoroughly possible that extra charge plays now the "insulted", after its petitions on mitigation of the arrest and house arrest were bumped into deaf ears. </seg>
<seg id="57"> During other criminal, that caused major damage with economy offense far and did not compensate this, stand at liberty, or at least under house arrest, remains forbids extra charge this possibility. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> In the attempt, a twinkling device was tied up the test subject at the left hand, which delivered the electro shock. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two paintings: To the one a picture of the mother of God, painted of Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other Leonardo there Vincis "lady with the ermine". </seg>
<seg id="10"> The researchers hoped that the view of the virgin Maria would evoke under the believing trances religious a type, while they selected there Vincis picture, because it differed hardly by the other painting and was perceived as calming. </seg>

<seg id="2"> On the occasion of its tenth birthday, Google can justifiably maintain: it is to be found in the pockets of the persons just as, like over its beheading in the sky: It knows where the persons spent its vacation, to which specialty physicians they go, and what moves it. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And therewith still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the manager of Google. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Toward skeptic, who are plagued by Orwellschen horror visions, he lets align: These would survey just the essential of the Web 2.0. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In an interview with the financial Times, Schmidt meant would be recently, the main goal of Google it to gather yet more personal data over the users and to come so the original objective of the firm more closely according to what it wanted organize" "all information of this world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Schmidt explained, let Google be after ten years of world changing work still first at the start of the information gathering. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Ask meant about the status Quo in five years Schmidt: he wished for, Google would be in a position, questions such as "what should I tomorrow do?" or "which job fits really to me?" to answer, to be sure would be software program not yet in a position in addition because it would know not enough over the users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> All Internets users are not themselves about that in the clear that in the train of its Internet investigation the that which is sought concepts would be registered, as well as also the IP ADDRESSES of which out of sought became, and the visited sides. </seg>
<seg id="9"> To store for example the two years ago introduced "Personalized Search" permitted the visitor its own that which is sought course and to fall back later on that so that the hits can be generated later much more precise, and on the same logic also the so named "Recommendations", with which the system recommends products tailor-made and services based on the earlier preferences, are based. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The users ask happens - "if one checks, what I make" - appear provides to be sure, what in the case a data abuse themselves some whether the Google data monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In most cases, it is however sooner the power represented, potential by the firm that causes fear exciting, and fewer the compunction or the fear of punishment, that striving after freedom or the rebellion against the power, that bumps at many Internets users into rejection. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is to be sure a proved fact that the that which is sought concepts not only stored, but rather in the occasion case also at third transmitted become, and in these law cases, there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A prime example for this was submitted lately the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the train its Google of the Brazilian government information, that were gathered by the partnership sites by the name of "Orkut", and also an identification of the pedophilias of enabled. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Users concerned around personal rights were able to breathe a sigh of relief however yet in May, pulled when Google jointly with the civil right organization EFF successfully against the FBI before court: accordingly can Google also in the future with no point of the constitution in addition forced become to publish information the FBI on secret inquiry. </seg>
<seg id="15"> (To be sure has the Federal Government successfully the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 that which is sought concepts with reference to the years ago dismissed child and youth protection legislation obtains, to be sure became its the list of the single user, or its Web list and that which is sought concept list on two months retroactively withhold). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Googles image remains therefore disputed: That that publish its personal data unwillingly because they fear the loss of its privacy and IntimsphÃ¤re through the use of the google services, scourges the business with that the of firms conservatively representing itself proper rebellion. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Meanwhile the American "Geek culture" sees that is present in many countries and enthused computer fans, activists and user eint, that next generation of the "cool entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, that is thanks to windows market leader, also if both fight for the same goal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> A possible reason for this is that Google demands its user in contrast to Microsoft no identification codes, and makes available its services free of charge so that an open source code permanently updated and program Package seem to be far more attractively, more youthfully and more coolly, than the official practices of the software giant. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the other hand the Geeks look through the problematic ratio of the personal rights and the Internet razor-sharply - a ratio that is moved especially in the past years thanks to the concept "Web 2.0" into the midpoint. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> In the "Web 2.0", it concerns leave behind namely nothing of other, when around Kollaboration, sprich, the users intentionally traces and utilize the available communication canals, and also if the sizes are individually different, the essential matter remains that, namely itself publicly to show. </seg>
<seg id="21"> An average youth can be administer simultaneously on several partnership portals profile - of Facebook over Xanga, can read interconnect can bind this by means of other services, like about Twitter, or music services how. fm, and all this in the end into an after pursuit system such as about FriendFeed or Blip. fm. In addition they can lead blogs, that automatically represent the newest photo galleries, that are on Flickr or Picasa geostet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> And a row of further exemplary cases proves: In the observing of the party photos of the past night, the friend will find out soon, with whom its unfaithful friend amused himself, or the colleague will release because he makes in its blog only all too honestly its vexation at the business management air - one is certain: The concept "privacy" completely newly was interpreted meanwhile. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Who leads an Online life, is that, what it of itself sacrifices - so in about could formulate one the reason idea behind the behavior of the current youth. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And who tries to hold somewhat secretly, or to go around quite the google monopoly, can do that gladly - like about with Scroogle, a tool, that take action to be sure on the search engine of Google, to be sure intentionally no traces leaves behind. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Few persons do not register intentionally not on partnership sides so that they are not detectable, but also the Online applications of Google, like about word-processings and graphic tools and RSS Feeds, let themselves go around with alternative versions, that are tied to no gigantic server parks and do not generate therefore also the optimum profile of the user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The public opinion waits banned meanwhile on that until Google shows its true face. </seg>
<seg id="27"> With its present value of USD 156 billions the business lies threaten the receipts of the advertising agencies even before IBM (USD 140 billions), Intel (USD 124 billions) or Coca Cola (USD 110 billions), the advertise areas of AdWords/AdSense, and not only Microsoft prepare the always faster introduced services, but rather also other software developer worry. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Critical spectators find to be sure also the disturbing against poles: So about the group direction completely rejected a protest of the colleague after the fees of the firm inclined kindergarten were doubled, moreover the management, the multiple provisions of the colleague meant would be too costly. That everything seems however quite mildly on the other hand that Google in 2006 went before the Chinese government even into the knees and was agreed with an agreement according to what all regime critical hits would be filtered out, or that that violate the good taste. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The internal regulation of the group reads that in advance no new service is applied, but rather is first if this also already available. Nevertheless the events of the coming months and years strongly could change radically again a few things: During some my, Googles book and Magazinscan- and/or archiving project would suppose meanwhile sizes that the business would have to explain itself soon with the waiter court, are disturbed other rather because of the system "Health", that enables the creation of a complete health profile on the basis of conditions, physicians and problems. </seg>
<seg id="30"> And the fact that Google constructs a genetic database, delivers the next generation of the Sci Fi authors already the material - about "Scroogled", that famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes in best orwellschen manner a future in which a person becomes thanks to data related by Google frightening closely cash. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> What would the best method to the development of new technologies to the accident avoidance be if the hindrances sensors to not to imitate out of nature? </seg>
<seg id="3"> For example that of the bees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In the CEATEC in Japan, an astonishing project was introduced, with which the Nissan engineers were inspired accident of new by bumblebee in the Erschaffung avoiding systems. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In collaboration with the Tokioter university, Nissan constructed the biomimetische system driven by car robots of the type BR23C, a mini car, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with which goal to support, the development of a system, that avoids each collision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the flight forms each bee its own, oval "private area", that is very similar our own "protection to sign", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, in the display. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The put together eye of the bee, that can see into each direction and in an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays at the same time an important role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In order to imitate the function of the put together eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser driven distance knife. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This identifies hindrances before the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates its distances and sends signals at the microprocessor at Board, that initiates immediately the kollisionsvermeidenden process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The hindrance is registered in fractions of a second, and the car robot changes immediately the course, similarly the movement of the bees in that it turns the tires around the corresponding angle. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "If it not so would be, could the car robot not quickly enough react, around the hindrances to avoid", explained Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the car robot project. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The system must instinctively and immediately react, corresponds there this technology to the most internal and most vulnerable part of the protection sign - a layer within which accidents count presently yet as unavoidable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The total process must reflect the behavior of the bees if they avoid other bees. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And that must expire in the fraction of a second. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> To be sure the avoiding not quite diagonally can result, in contrast to the bees, up, down, or - it can be only two-dimensional, and to be sure only toward the turning point bar-ness of the tire. </seg>
<seg id="17"> While the bees here endlessly many possibilities openly stand, in order to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to make use of at the car robot of only the rotation, or the accelerating and braking. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BR23C contains have lithium polymer batteries that are easier and energy more efficient, and therefore a longer service life, than a conventional lithium ion batteries. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Andoh explained, it comes on the instinctive, intelligent reaction on, and fewer on the processing of the data, and yet fewer on the capacity to store this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> This device must process some input per second solely and must react correspondingly to it. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It doesn't have to store produce this, or on the basis of earlier maneuver a intuitive, logical reaction so that it uses running merely a handful of KB memory. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It needs no gigabyte memories and megabyte of heavy memories. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is the first step under development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, that will be after estimation of Nissan within the next ten years standard in production. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> A further use could find the technology in the GPS satellite navigation in that it directs the driver deliberately around hindrances around and leads it so at the goal. </seg>

<seg id="3"> In the first run, the half of the money is supposed to be issued. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In a session, that went on Saturday after midnight local time east coast to end, the congresswomen brought themselves after multi-day debates to a unification over the rescue package heavy 700-Milliarden-Dollar 700-Milliarden-Dollar billions 700-Milliarden-Dollar DOLLAR, reported Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> "We have essential progress obtains", said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the American house of representatives, and meant, had to put one the unification only on paper. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Both presidency candidates supported the obtained compromise over the rescue package - Barack Obama and John McCain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Treasury Minister Henry Paulson meant to the result: The program will show effect and becomes it efficient, one had to do however yet more. According to Pelosi, it would not concern tearing around here the rescue of the Wall Street, but rather therefore, the oar of the economy. </seg>

<p>

<seg id="11"> We are satisfied with the progress obtained in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the white house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The program deviates to be sure from the original recommendation of the Bush administration according to what the 700 billions of dollar should be issued all at once for the purchase more rotten, with credit of burdened securities. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a first tranche, the half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages 700-Milliarden-Betrages billion 700-Milliarden-Betrages of fraud is supposed to be issued maximally whereby 250 billions are immediately available, after the congress will vote as expected on Monday over the Causa. This sum is supposed to be spent for the purchase of credit onerous, bad securities, and over the further 100 billion USD, the president should decide. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The program is reviewed of an own commission, that also the president of the Federal reserve listened to. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of the congress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the sense of the law, the treasury can use also a combined tactic: It can burdened purchase simultaneously bad credit, mortgages, and with mortgages securities, or also other "poisonous" credit. </seg>
<seg id="17"> How responsible persons of the ministry reported, the purchase can both in an auction and direct result. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The law enables pay it the concerned firms to participate in an insurance program, with which the treasury guarantees the serious means, and the businesses the fees corresponding to expecting damages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Henry Paulsen said: The law defined the necessary means so that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as an immediately aid for the American financial system, would be it for the large-scale purchase of bad means, its insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk that is released by the collapse of a larger money institute. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We set the necessary steps so that we are ready to the introduction of the law, as soon as it was signed, so Paulson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The bosses of that in difficulties of advised and now on national aid directed banks can calculate to be sure therewith that its dispatches, that are named in the overseas slang careless "gold-like handshake", of which government are shortened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> There will be an abridgment of the salaries only in certain cases, and these abridgments will depend therefrom how the treasury assists respectively. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The abridgment meant essentially that if the ministry purchases in the frame of an auction, so that "gold-like handshake" taxed becomes, unless, the from served bank boss is pushed off into the pension. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In the case a direct purchase of that, credit go bad aggressively will turn on itself the government in order to guarantee that the manager salaries are not exaggerated. </seg>
<seg id="25"> To the picture is appropriate also that the existing are not changed gold-like handshake contracts - the restrictions relate only on new agreements so that the more persons participate in the program. </seg>
<seg id="26"> That is the first case in the American story that abridgments are regulated in manager salaries per law, commented on the democrat Barney Frank, chairperson of the finance committee, the measure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> The country wins participation rights at the interested banks so that the risk sinks for the taxpayers, because they can take part also, as soon as it again better goes the economy and therewith also the rescued bank. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The bill plans that the president must submit the congress in the next five years a suggestion, how the taxpayers should recover its lost money out of the finance sector again. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The elite are in danger </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The phenomenon had reveals itself already some days ago when the delegate chamber agreed against the 700 billion-dollar-save package of the white house: A large part of the American was and is interested to rescue more on that to punish the Wall Street than the economy. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is confirmed the edition of yesterday of the New York Times that reports therefrom, how the crisis in the course step the republican party separates, that more and more splits into its old and moderate East Coast soul, who always the national institutions and the businesses community favored and that neokonservative, that "which hostily stands in opposition in Washington" and the finance world and wins v. a. in the south and the center of the countries voter. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This part of the party owes its ascent v. a. the voice of its that I mentioned above. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This example mentioned just now is meanwhile only a small part of the large variations, that announces or even already represents the momentary economic earthquake: not only in the USA, also in the total west and perhaps also over this out will be concerned by this. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Both in the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events, which suppose shape under these new conditions finally and come at the light. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the shocking renaissance of the country in connection with a type Renationalisierung of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In the deed, the crisis means a decline of the bank institutions and finance institutions, which narrow connection to foreign countries possess and administer at the same time an enormous quantity of the fortunes of private households, that live in a single country. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This means a direct political problem for the governments: namely like it vis-Ã -vis the concerned families to behave counts, which represent also a voter mass enormous. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The crisis appears is therefore economically globally, politically on the other hand it almost purely national. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The political internationalism seems so at itself in that to one side of run to be and to have lost its speech right: The clear proof for this was given by the EU, which knows to find based on its division into different national and international conflicts no joint way. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Therefore all reckon now with the intervention of the own country; rescue plans, new rules, and v. a. distribution of auxiliary fund: Since the crisis became more and more more serious, the USA in the situation economical is to be rescued itself solely without strange aid. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And next to the means, they possess to use in addition also the authorization this: therefore two not to over valued prerequisites â under certain circumstances â, on which otherwise probably no international organization and no market in more similar manner will be able to fall back. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> That new stress, that is put on the nationally national element, is in the remaining in perfect harmony with the always larger meaning, that is connected most young the economy with one on the close relative sector in: the TerritorialitÃ¤t. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It is were more paradoxical manner just now, than we yet so convinced to have entered a long time into a networked total empire, into an empire of the always differentiated technologies, the immaterial that we must assess all at once, like our future yet more and more of the essentially material things depend becomes: Water, harvest and oil. </seg>
<seg id="16"> These can be transported to be sure certainly all by a place at that others the world, are connected however nevertheless on extreme with a closely circumscribed piece earth â a territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore that that controls such a territory is, one of other vis-Ã -vis, that in a harvest unproductive, waterless or of oil occurrence free zone lives, in the advantage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I come now to the second novelty, that prefaces however a short on push. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Who, who government, who says politics, therewith also Leadership says to territory. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In this sense, the finance crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the one hand the knowledge is there around the necessity of esteemed Leaderships, therefore the need after someone, who knows, how one regulates the things. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On the other side, a wave of the indignation exists now over the existing leaderships, v. a. that the economy which turned out to be insufficient and full shadow zones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Thereto a deep passing and in certain sense yet disturbing aspect comes in the end: A loss of trust, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of the distance that is based altogether on an entire class of managers of the western countries. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It seems to clear itself so the conviction under large parts of the population the way that it would not be first the deeds of the social elite, but rather already its idea world, its Way of Life, its culture in the broadest sense of the word,, whose salary represents come over itself the majority as always more strangely and. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The demand after Leadership nourishes branched therefore underground one however powerful movement of the deprivation of power of the leading class and the conventional political Establishments. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voter and in the sudden reversal of the collective mind condition of the last time: beginning with the ascent of the conservative in Austria and Bavaria, over the breakdown of the Labour party in Great Britain, there to the rebellion of the American delegates against Bush (and perhaps plays also the victory of the rights in Italy here a role). </seg>
<seg id="26"> One gets the impression, as would have the old elite, its parties, its programs, but also hers advised, periodicals, intellectual creditor, many one would say its format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value regarding its, what goes nowadays in the lower social layers of the west before itself and yet reinforces by the finance crisis, and up to the ÃberdimensionalitÃ¤t driven becomes. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In view of all its it simply would be exaggerated to speak about a "rebellion of the measures". </seg>
<seg id="28"> To hold the eyes however far open it is not certain meanwhile. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The market for dwellings for studying knows no crises. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Loudly the last investigation of the Sunia, the tenant labor union, can cost a single room a student up to 900 Euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This phenomenon supposed already very serious trains. Entire multitudes of students lose to study so in reality its right because its families are not in a position to support it in this height" âso the responsible of the Sunia, Laura Mariani â "in these cities leads the large demand on the part of the students to a Deformierung of the market, who damaged also the other inhabitants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Moreover most rent offers include a row of offences: free contracts, missing registration, without rent price boundary, prohibited subleases. </seg>
<seg id="6"> For the Sunia, the necessity exists after extraordinary measures, which lead through a revision of the taxation to lower Mietpreisen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In more exact view of the investigation stands out that in Milan a roost in the quarter Brianza ca. 450 Euro required will begin; a single room in 650 Euro (in the quarter of volumes Nere) and ends with 800 Euro in the quarter Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or quite 900 Euro in the quarter Vittoria. </seg>

<seg id="14"> In Bari, a roost costs 250-350 Euro, a single room at least 350. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In the smallest cities, the prices are lower, but they have a larger weight in the municipal economy. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Goodbye to the old movie theater Paradiso â its historic movie theater halls close the cities </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The historic movie theaters close based on the favored Multiplexkinos. </seg>
<seg id="3"> "A city without movie theater halls is a blind city, like a face without Augen." </seg>
<seg id="4"> This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect, what happens momentarily in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The process of the exclusion of the movie theaters, that began with the birth of the large Multisaalkomplexe in the periphery, means in the long run death for the on hall movie theater in the center. A process that appears not only inevitably and irrevocably, but rather also the trains of a cultural crime carries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Concerned are usually historic places full memories, "it is like a friend to lose, with the emotions full one a piece street traversed has", so the director the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" that brought in it 20 years ago the Oskar and the large price of Cannes. It concerns the story of a suburb movie theater and its nostalgia, which exists from that to live in one probably for always lost movie theater worlds. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The numbers, which the Anec, that central business association delivers, speak one clearly language: in the last five years had to close paid the enormous quantity of 316 traditional movie theater; this mine to a large degree the movie theaters in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> To the most strongly concerned regions, the Emilia Romagna with 82 lost movie theater belong, followed of the Tuscany with 44 and the Lombardei with 41. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This witnesses therefrom that the head indebted are the Multiplexkinos, for are straight these three regions, in which the largest number of these modern movie theaters was registered: with 195 in the last 5 years leads the Lombardei the lists on, it are 81 both in the Tuscany and in the Emilia Romagna. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "The business has itself in an irrational manner developed", so Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "it is to be sure usefully that also new structures arise, but at first place stands the receipt of the already existing, for closes a hall in the city, are not all its patrons ready to search for in place of the old a Multiplexkino in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And here yet the missing budget respect remains external for the foundation the business association: the indebtedness indicated by the country amounts to ca. 10 million Euro. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a shame of the ethically moral standpoint that the government does not note the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In order to received the sector, would be between 16 and 18 million Euro in the year of needs". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which concluded based on the anxieties around the old movie theater halls, is, to protect this through an agreement between the community and the Anec; it concerns the first agreement of this type in Italy, that aims on that to protect and to support the traditional movie theaters, and this both in the historic center and in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Under the anticipated measures, also fiscal before divisions are for the movie theater operators as well as advantages for the public regarding the local traffic: it will be permitted, to go into the verkehrslimitierten areas of the center and to park moreover to more favorable parking fee. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "It is a pleasant initiative", so Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join to our example and sketch in addition also yet new drafts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Certainly however we require also a better Audio- and video equipment in order to be able to align against the superpower of the MultiplexsÃ¤le something, for in the end the public of today is more demanding. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The defense of the traditional movie theater was for me always an important subject: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, that place of my childhood and youth to establish, was the decisive point, that brought me in addition the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", also if I had played already for 10 years with the thought. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For 25 years I have lived in Rome; if I pass at the Rialto or at the Quirinale in that via Nazionale, there where I experienced so many different emotions, turn I me to the side in order to not to have to see the dust overcast placards. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Waves, currents and tide are look seek the new renewable energy sources at that now everyone, and to occupy also, about giant such as Chevron. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The possibility to win energy out of the movements of the sea, is taken already for 70 years into consideration and examines intensified itself; not accidentally these studies since the first earth oil crisis considerably. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the price of the oil around 1980, vergas broke on press one the idea of the sea energy, now however the environment organizations and the increased oil price on new impulses in this sector. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The world Energy Council (WEC) in London appreciates that 15% of the worldwide energy demand could be covered by the energies produced by the ocean waves. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This would come the double of the energy produced momentarily by nuclear power plants same. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Thereto yet the currents and tide would come moreover. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Giant in the attack. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The first firm, that sets now on the sea energy, is Enersis, that has signs in 2005 a contract to the erection of a power plant in the north of Portugal. </seg>
