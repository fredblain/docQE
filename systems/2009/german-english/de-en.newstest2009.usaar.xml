</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The American legislators reached a breakthrough in conversations about the discharge of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid for the American financial system in an extent of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> However, this does not mean no victory. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The congress representatives must negotiate indeed still some details of the agreement before they may publish the final version of the law and vote on that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The plan to support the financial system is discussed on Monday in the US Congress. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On Sunday the chairman of the committee on said this to Barney Frank of the Reuters agency news for banking and financial services. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the Senate the plan could be voted on according to different information probably at the earliest on Wednesday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to economists a communication should be the first significant psychological factor over the plan being adopted for a revival of the financial markets. </seg>
<seg id="11"> After that it is attributed, however, one "disenchantment" due to the complicated mechanisms, as one could help the markets also in the practice. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> Paulson: The plan must be effective </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "we have achieved a significant step forward. </seg>
<seg id="14"> We clarified our different views to how a parcel for to stabilise the market is supposed to look "the Democrat said to Nancy Pelosi opposite the agency certain. </seg>

<seg id="22"> According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid the legislators are called in for reaching still before Sunday in Congress to a final agreement. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In this way one wants to calm indeed the investors in front of shops on the Asian financial markets who lie in the first time zone, where a decision by the Congress could influence the business on Monday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Up to now, however, it is not yet very clear when both chambers of the American congress will vote on the law, also there is problem over whether nevertheless the negotiations in a last minute way could not fail because of a problem yet. </seg>

<seg id="27"> The total amount determined to To help for the system is supposed to be divided into two parts. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The initial 350 billion dollars are supposed to be set as quickly as possibly readily as president George Bush required. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The congress can block, however, the filling of the remaining money if he has the impression that the programme does not fulfill his function and indeed at further 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Bush evaluates progress positively in negotiations </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The president has a veto indeed with this decision, however the Congress can outvote his veto. </seg>
<seg id="32"> In spite of these changes the basic idea of the programme that was based on attaining budgets for the Abkauf of bad mortgage bonds that value fell kept on, however, existing because hundreds are not Americans anymore in the situation to pay back their mortgages. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The new law is supposed to restrict also the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the societies, which are participated in the program and employs a committee that is supposed to be of the supervision in charge about the fund. </seg>
<seg id="40"> the Treasury is supposed to route this. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "we have worked very hard at that and a big step forward in direction of an agreement achieves, that one functioned and important for the market and for all Americans is", so Paulson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The plan reckons also an aid for houseowners who have problems with the repayment its mortgage. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Marek: psychological help </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> The suggested plan is a good idea after the chief economist of Patria under David Marek, however, the implementation becomes very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="46"> "and therefore indeed, because one does not know through what mechanism and around what price the problematic assets are bought up. </seg>
<seg id="47"> That will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government divide up the losses between under each other ", Marek said this week the server iHNed.cz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Whether the plan now or at the beginning of next week is adopted is not according to Mareks opinion decisive. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "a lot of more important it is, that the Congress agree on that, the plan to support and that they adopt it as quickly as possibly. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The psychological importance of the agreement on its resulting in an adoption is the most important thing in this moment ", Marek stressed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Duel on a knife-edge: MP3 players against mobile phones. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> We advise you during your choice </seg>
<seg id="3"> While nearly every mobile phone is can play MP3 - files yet not MP3 player can phone. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Therefore that it is better to be bought only a telephone it looks of course like this. </seg>
<seg id="5"> For all that there are sufficiently reasons for why one should adopt an independent Player. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The election completely hangs from the type of use and the demands the future owner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Surely one scarcely buys oneself for at home a fabulous expensive phonograph, in order to listen to the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc on that. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from qualitative point of view there is not also any objective reason for that. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you have LPs with kind of rock, jazz or blues in the shelf, however, you dream probably at least about one like that. </seg>
<seg id="10"> That also with the music is like this on journeys, therefore with compressed music, simplifies expressed - music in the MP3 format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also here there are price and quality categories. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For one it is not maybe acceptable to spend eight thousand kronor for a Player, in the same way a Pink - Floyd - fan will presumably scarcely verkraften, however headphones on for twenty crowns the market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Two extremes between which there is for every sufficient room. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The selection is widely diversified. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Also the lifespan of the batteries is decisive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some good Music Player can play music much more than only, however that, what mobile phones can, they do not get not even in outline. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern equipment is to be used as universally as the telephone is. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Next to the primary functions, the making a call and that ledges, it can display music and videos, to record both it has a better once, once a worse camera and can navigate maybe also. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And if one includes still the Smartphons and Kommunikatoren, one has almost a small computer in the pocket. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a minor miracle, because no fridge can grill and not to photograph no television. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the universality of mobile phones brings also disadvantages with themselves. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more frequently you will have to re-load it, however. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And that of music is one of the largest everything. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Only a few phones can music longer when ten - to play twelve hours, mostly it is much less. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this respect are to music player (specifically the simplest) clearly stronger. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Therefore you should reckon near cheap mobile phones their not being able to play music longer as a few hours. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you phone then now and then still, you buy a loader more with pleasure still for the safety for office - that is valid also for more expensive equipment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> At MP3 players you will not have this problem, to hold also that one less good at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with a time To Load from. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Another problem exists then if one wants to re-record the music onto on mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately only a small part of the equipment has a USB - end, in addition every mobile phone without special software can not be connected directly to a PC. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Of course one can re-record the music directly onto a storage medium, nevertheless only few reading equipment card becomes without reduction with the tiny memory cards ready, that are used in mobile phones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> At players you do not need no special software apart from exceptions (iPod). </seg>
<seg id="33"> You need to feed the device with music only above USB - port from your PC. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Most mobile phones and Player create even a music library, arranged according to the name of the performers, the title of the album, the pointed or for example the assessment by users. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some devices show only the tree network of the symbolic address table, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, cowons, intelligent telephones with operating system). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Player are easier to help oneself mobile phones can more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> You should ask the selection of a specific appliance in particular about the service life of the accumulator, storage capacity, the quality and the model of the sound and of course also the operating convenience. </seg>
<seg id="38"> If particularly backdrop is music for you and if you hear it every day only briefly for example in the trams, an arbitrary Handy which plays MP3 - files suffices then. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What real almost every mobile phone can. </seg>
<seg id="40"> You do not have to control either particularly which music formats a mobile phone or a Player can process. </seg>
<seg id="41"> MP3 create all of them, and most music which you get will be just in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format appertains to the most spread, and in addition the majority equipment can play also music in the WMA - format. </seg>
<seg id="43"> AAC is less usual (to use (a format, that Apple and his iPods). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Better mobile phones facilitate also the purchase of music in an online way. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One needs to call the corresponding pages of a Providers (or any other provider) only about mobile Internet, and already one can gain a song or album. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This service can be already at and for itself a beating argument for why one should adopt a Musikhandy. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately this supply of providers is bad and is restricted mostly only to fast broadcast hits. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The prices are not the lowest either. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Generally, however, one assumes just this kind of the sale of music (it is over GSM, Internet or radio-controlled Internet) in future dominating the music industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Most bear the mobile phone with themselves. </seg>
<seg id="51"> if you have inclination to listen to something, you grasp the mobile phone in the pocket while to forget is suiting to the Player at home. </seg>
<seg id="52"> It depends, however, on whether you ever bear headphones or at least a radio-controlled hands-free equipment with yourself. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Otherwise, you can access to the integrated loudspeaker that almost every mobile phone has, however only the least MP3 players. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The presumably greatest advantage of the Musikhandys will lie for many in the price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The cheapest taste normally less than three thousand kronor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> for three - and you already get four thousand kronor a very decent Walkman. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The biggest handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The best and technically advanced telephones with a for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand kronor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The advantage of the player lies in turn in the slight serving. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The simplest - and not absolutely cheapest (see selection) - everyone can help itself Player real. </seg>
<seg id="61"> A minimum of functions, the similarity during the serving with that formerly normal cassette recorder or for example the phonograph is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="62"> It no collision in the form of an erroneously done mobile Internets and one threatens then horrendous bill for data transfers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> the device should one grasp now </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> The cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) have normally a slot for exchangeable storage medium (Model M2, microSD and similar things. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Even if you buy a proper card two thousand kronor suffice. </seg>
<seg id="66"> However, respect. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Only cards with a maximum capacity are normally supported in the basis models by 2 GB. </seg>
<seg id="68"> Only the most expensive can read also 8 - GB memory cards. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> If you own have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap mp3 player, you catch Emgeton then after cowons, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, or iriver. </seg>
<seg id="70"> According to capacity (maximally. 2 GB) you must put then not more than 1100 crowns onto the table. </seg>
<seg id="71"> You belong to more demanding listeners, you take more with pleasure specialized Handys - Walkman (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). </seg>
<seg id="72"> These machines have independent control knobs for MP3, and the operating convenience comes so onto that of an individual MP3-Players here. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Sony Ericsson, whose Handys have the same user api from the series Walkman as the separately sold MP3-Player, is widest here. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first virtual service providers comes already this year to Czech Republic. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Maybe </seg>
<seg id="3"> The mobile market in the Czech Republic matured right, the Czech providers offer virtually all services as they are offered also by their partners in Western Europe. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In spite of that something is missing here - a virtual service providers, that forces the classical to lower prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Maybe this anymore long one will be able to be maintained on itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> That the Czech car phone providers to the most expensive in Europe work anyway, we already often reported about that on Mobil.cz. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This confirmed after all also the telecommunications authority TÚ which on that it made attentive that of the price is here higher for a SMS than in the rest of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the last steps of the European commission in the field regulation of the Roaminggebühren it comes to a paradoxical situation so probably too - for some customers of the Czech instance SMS will be cheaper from the foreign country than at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> how does it come that the prices are so high in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is simple, it the competition that in fact does a challenge is missing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Maybe it rings paradoxically, nevertheless in the Czech Republic there are three land mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%. </seg>
<seg id="12"> On the other hand the car phone providers swear about there being a lot of competition on the Czech market extremely with pleasure. </seg>
<seg id="13"> To the often also the chairperson of the council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority () Pavel Dvoák pflichtet, that had expressed in the past often, that there is not any place in the Czech Republic for another supplier. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It makes probable that a classic providers with a own network does not have many opportunities more particularly (after all he would also hardly yet probably find frequencies). </seg>
<seg id="15"> There is, however still a possibility - a virtual service providers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Just the entry of virtual providers on the mobile market brought a clear mark-down with themselves which then the classic instance had to react to. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In this case there were still similar votes before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile onto the market in United Kingdom as in Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It, however, it proved that there is place for such providers and that these can be in fact successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> After all one does not need to search long for examples. </seg>
<seg id="20"> To have this in In February we reported about the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Only in just a half year this providers succeeded in winning more than 100 thousand customers and climbing up so to the five - tallest provider of the country. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The financial group of Penta which has U:fon among other things in Czech Republic supports Mobilking in this case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> fon has. The advantage of virtual suppliers consists in this case in one being able to concentrate on a much more specific target. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order to be able to function effectively virtual service providers need indeed a lot of less customers as a classic suppliers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> You do not need indeed not a relatively high cost for the building, the company and maintenance of a mobile network. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the world the virtual service providers usually distinguish themselves so as Low-Cost companies out - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, what, however, often of one little is accompanied extensive portfolio of services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> So Tesco Mobile offers for example SMS more cheaply in Great Britain at least around half than its competitors do. </seg>
<seg id="28"> How, however the example points from Mobilking in Poland can be also a move, quite good to back on a target audience not klischeehafte. </seg>
<seg id="29"> these providers consults men in an indeed particular way. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Echte fellows choose Mobilking - the provider, which they like and that they trust ability", so David Seibert, the chief executive of the Mobile entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual prey. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Heavy to say whether a similar concept could grip as in terminals also in the Czech Republic get a foothold. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Also the press officers of Vodafone Miroslav doubts about that epický: "this Czech market is for a market segment which most virtual providers base on, relatively small. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition it is relatively satisfied from the viewpoint of the services. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In the Czech Republic chance - free, the car phone providers mean </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> It is, however, almost secure that this will not be Mobilking if a virtual instance conquers the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "we to talk indeed about an expansion this successful project, nevertheless in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopefully. </seg>
<seg id="37"> It rather becomes a market entry of Mobilking in other countries our region kommen ", so says in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz Jana Studniková, press officers of the financial group of Penta. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Indirectly she confirmed so that the current instance are to this idea particularly not inclined in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="39"> On the contrary, they attempt to do everything for not a potential competitor arising. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Your interest at a start of a virtual car phone provider shows already since some time the group to GTS Novera that would like to do a further step in order to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area company customers. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "we a great interest in that have, our customers not only Fixed Network -, but to offer also car phone telecommunication services. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And each formerly, all the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> About this opportunity we repeated with all Czech costs negotiates. </seg>
<seg id="44"> With some of them we "could" achieve "already negotiation progress", according to the press officers of the group Pavel Kaidl. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Maybe now better times come. </seg>
<seg id="46"> It follows from No official information that maybe the first virtual service providers is to be expected until the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Up to now, however, this of a insurmountable wall of silence is surrounded. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "in this moment we go out not, that in the Czech Republic place exists for a full virtual providers. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market shows great specifics opposite other markets. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Up to now has us still no subject with a complex and serious project in this area address ", means in his declaration for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Srse from the press department of Telefónica O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> also other providers refer to the nature of the Czech market. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The press officers of t - mobile Martina Kemrová matches in rare with the statement from O2: "up to now we have still not found any viable and both ways useful project which one would keep on being able to build on. </seg>
<seg id="53"> And she adds: "in the network from t mobile hardly a virtual service providers will emerge until the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="54"> In this moment we would have to have been there already a specific offer in order to be able to think so for a short period of time. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone rather focuses its attention on the fulfillment of the demands of the own 3G-Lizenz. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav epický means for this purpose: "for negotiations with potential virtual suppliers we are open, in particular in the field division of costs and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Just to consider this we from the viewpoint of the customers as the best. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The key strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to the construction of a divided net for a rapid mobile Internet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The actions of the instance is to be understood easily, a further provider would be called more competition, this would lead to prices to be sunk also to a reduction in the profits and through that. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Why therefore one should facilitate the entering market for a such competitors? </seg>
<seg id="62"> also the long one proves Back And Forth that the supplier can pull at pull together if it is a question of something around the origin of U:fon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> fon. the Probably strongest pressure in direction went at this time, as U: fon onto the market came, from society when. </seg>
<seg id="64"> also publicly accessible information from the prove that. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Now, however, itself just has U: fon as an argument, why one should not admit a virtual service providers. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Martina Kemrová commented on that: "this competitive environment of the mobile telephone market was in addition still strengthened recently by the market entry of a fourth car phone provider. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Considering the character of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic it is obvious that a new player would make high demands on the market itself and especially its services. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> Faced with this approach the instance the absolute indifference of the Czech regulators amazes, however. </seg>
<seg id="69"> It is not only a question dabei in order to intervene the attitude of the TÚ that does not have the competence unfortunately in Czech - unlike Great Britain and further highly developed states - into the economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="70"> This has exclusively the office to the protection of the economical competition (ÚOHS). </seg>
<seg id="71"> This, however, got its very typical attitude for this whole issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> "this market entry of a virtual car phone provider would be then possible, after it resulted in a contract conclusion between a instance and a virtual service providers about the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Up to now no such treaty was not closed, because the supply of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional operators ", so in his answer to our inquiry Kristián Chalupa of the department external relations of the ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> From representatives of the supplier such a formulation would not surprise. </seg>
<seg id="75"> From an authority which is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and to see nobody misuses his position on the market to it among other things this is more than dubious. </seg>
<seg id="76"> In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual service providers in a very normal way work, it is to be observed that their market contributed to a price reduction with mobile telephone services." </seg>
<seg id="77"> Probably, however, belong the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price not for the interests of the ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> Real shocking at this case the almost already moving unison of the three instance that results from their reactions is. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question whether it is a question only of a coincidence in fact lies on the hand. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Just the same as the absolutely same price of petrol at the petrol stations secure only a coincidence and the result of a tough competition is. </seg>
<seg id="81"> "this authority did not discover in this matter any signs that indicate an action directed towards the competition, and thus she does not have also any reason to intervene in the matter in any way. </seg>
<seg id="82"> No one of the supplier has a dominant market position, thus he does not have either the corresponding increased responsibility for his actions on the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> also the regulator probably lacks the necessary instruments for an aperture of the mobile telephone market to virtual service providers for telecommunication ", Chalupa mentioned in its statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The interpretation of the dominating position on the market is one of many points in dispute. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Of course there is an analysis of the relevant markets, elaborated by the TÚ, to which telecommunications is a single market from the viewpoint of the economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="86"> On such a market no one of the Czech instance holds then of course a dominating position. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Some legal experts but, offer a different vision - for the market entry of a virtual supplier always the approval of the network operator with is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And the instance has this monopoly - logically - for its network. </seg>
<seg id="89"> That one means that it takes a dominating position in a particular segment of necessity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Even if one, however, does not accompany with this argument, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three instance go ahead strikingly similarly. </seg>
<seg id="91"> In this case complaints of a number of interested parties prove (including the mentioned society GTS Novera) that they find a very similar obstacles in the case of negotiations with all providers. </seg>
<seg id="92"> The Abwälzung of the blame on the is then a quite usual trick with which the ÚOHS distanziert of the whole matter in the telecommunication services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> This was to be observed already in a number similar cases. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately did not succeed in putting through the enlargement of the powers of the into the novelette of the telecommunications law recently said goodbye onto the field of economic competition in the telecommunication although a number of experts had expected to improve the situation of that. </seg>
<seg id="95"> The representatives of the ÚOHS must know that only far too well, however, probably they have other interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It works already if nobody hinschaut </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> The functioning of any of pseudovirtual providers from whom there are several in the Czech mobile networks now remains unseen first once. </seg>
<seg id="98"> There are companies which issue own schedules of prices for mobile telecommunications services which, however, are only in part public. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Usually it is a question indeed of companies which act in the field multilevel - marketing. </seg>
<seg id="100"> their own mobile telephone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and other ones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The lists these companies succeeded usually only to chosen ones. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The joke of the matter consists in the company acting as a classical company customer who makes onto SIM cards an appointment with a large amount opposite the operator. </seg>
<seg id="103"> As important customer he receives specific quotations (and other offers) then. </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem consists in the conditions of all Czech instance forbidding a similar resale. </seg>
<seg id="105"> there "should" be "cases that you describe, then it can be a question of an injury of the contractual conditions" which "we will occupy ourselves" with "then, which can lead to a termination of cooperation with the relevant society", Martina Kemrová answered our question on this problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> Something like that is quite unlikely to itself not to get about with the leaders of the instance, however. </seg>
<seg id="107"> In particular in the case of the three mentioned companies it can be a question of thousands of customers. </seg>
<seg id="108"> No operator opposes, however an such approach. </seg>
<seg id="109"> From the activity of these firms flow them profits indeed not to be neglected, simultaneously they are not influenced - unlike the real virtual suppliers - by the real official marketing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> Onto potential problems Miroslav makes epický attentive: "this law facilitates such kinds of speculation, for all that the services of these companies only of a very small percentage of customers are used. </seg>
<seg id="111"> These must in addition accept that the SIM-Karte does not work onto your name in their telephone, they can not have therefore that genuinely as the normal customers of the instance. </seg>
<seg id="112"> Already only that, however, the TÚ would have to occur at least strangely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> In addition a further question opens up for the ÚOHS. </seg>
<seg id="114"> The car phone providers shut the eyes to an such approach, why they jib at a virtual providers? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It is to be added that the ÚOHS for to the discovery of such activities has right strong powers and if it does not want, does not have to zufriedengeben with the declaration of the providers they would not know anything of that and their business conditions would forbid this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> When Czech Republic is not more expensive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> As in the text already repeatedly was stressed, the market entry of virtual service providers brought a sharp price drop with the different services with themselves. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Where in all countries virtual service providers virtually arose in this case, attempted the traditional operators, whose to prevent emergence virtually more or less. </seg>
<seg id="119"> The arguments used by them were virtually identical - a market in a too smaller way, and/or too very satisfied, problems with the quality of services and so forth. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> In the highly developed countries but, the regulatory bodies intervened just in these times, that by no means the interests of the instance, but to preserve that of their customers attempted. </seg>
<seg id="121"> It is through formal measures or nonformal pressure, they achieved, that the first virtual operator arose, and this followed wider. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately the Czech regulatory bodies throw the whole case to themselves as a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Departing from our experience we can not rid ourselves from the impression that problem is more than favorable in the powers in these cases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> Nevertheless we do not fling the gun into the granule. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If the background information are right and soon a virtual service providers emerges the Czech mobile market will maybe soon move itself again. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If a supplier approves the origin of a virtual car phone provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive if it is a question of refusing other interested parties (to discriminate). </seg>
<seg id="127"> And the Czechs will not phone then more expensively at last than the rest of Europe will. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Germans of Krumau ask the American president in the letter, it is not supposed to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - that was charmed by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - onto Czechoslovakia. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> "we the situation have understood correct and want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies German territory in fact, but when liberator", it is called in a letter, that with the Worten "Menschen, that the fate of the Sudeten hug at the liegt" sign is. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> Since the end of the Czechoslovakia makes the Sudetendeutschen ones presume - in knowledge of the Czech national character -, the author of the letter ask the American president for their expecting brutality, thoughtlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, to take over the Bohemian Forest for today and for ever the protection domination. </seg>

<seg id="12"> If the of the president entertains doubts about the mind of the Böhmerwalddeutschen, it is sufficient if it initiated a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau over whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or to live under the protection rule of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Although the text of the letter likes to ring in today's knowledge of the post-war a little naively, it draws, however a good picture in opinion of some time witnesses with regard to the former expectations of the Sudetendeutschen ones. </seg>

<seg id="9"> If this is not planned in the bus, the travellers must sit. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The long-distance journey penance of student Agency have no standing-rooms; what the director of the company, Radim Janura, opposite Aktuáln.cz confirmed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "this we have discussed with the ministry, and this did not agree first the movement from passengers. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Later one has this taken back, and we are taken for a consensus according to which the travellers may go onto the toilet during the journey if they have your seat "it informed of his position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The law does not know any steward </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "There is not any unambiguous legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Also no right regulation which forbids it to the carrier gives, however, to produce services. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The law on the road knows only the concept vehicle companion; it does not define its rights and obligations, however, "the speaker of the department Hanzelka adds unambiguously. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The director of the Department automobiles of the traffic department Josef Pokorný on the other hand means, that the law subsequently covers this issue. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "it comes on that whether the bus has also standing-rooms in the product. </seg>
<seg id="19"> That is then everything ", it stresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Buses subdivide into urban buses where there are standing-rooms and the maximum speed is restricted, local transport buses with standing-rooms and a higher allowed rate and long-distance journey penance without standing-rooms with the highest permitted speed and seats that are equipped with seat belts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As in the airplane, the professional says </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The BESIP - specialist for road safety Jaroslav Hoín does not see not a fundamental problem in the movement from stewards on board a bus. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "With some fluid operating parameters many threats do not threaten, the situation is comparable with the service on board a plane. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Also here is not secure, when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can push the head. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "If a bus brakes, however, sharply, also the laws of physics are valid of course then. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Just the same as in the city bus or in a tram. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The Beförderer must "clarify" the safety of the stewards through internal rules, he says and means also that these problems are completely not solved from the viewpoint of the law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Janura is ready to delete the services </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Student Agency offers as only bus company services of stewards. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The company employs around 200 people in this role. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The director does not regard their profession as risk - pregnant also after the accident. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> "as soon as I, however, the impression that the profession of the steward is risk - pregnant gets I will delete it. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The travellers can receive coffee and newspapers during in boarding. </seg>
<seg id="34"> That would become also costs lowering ", he thinks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As interest in the security the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin establishes the absence of stewards in his buses. His society practices, however, only one fraction of lines in comparison with a student Agency. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "We do not have any stewardesses, we defend ourselves against that already from the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Sooner or later this with some fatal ends accident ", it had expressed before not completely a year for Týden.cz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> That was an unbelievable tragedy </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> During the accident of a public service bus to Naples a young stewardess from the area Pilsen who had worked two years for the society had verunglückt. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The Slovenian lorries was probable without flashing from the state that angled and the journey had blocked to the bus. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The driver of the bus attempted to avoid through a totally manoeuvres, collided, however, with the lorries with the right could. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Janura denies that the two seats were sold for the stewards. </seg>
<seg id="43"> "These places can not be reserved in the case of long-distance calls, they are blocked." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> firm wants to sue Lorry drivers. </seg>
<seg id="45"> With a compensation for the family of the young woman the agency will not wait for the court, she expects a financial compensation, however, also on the part of the guilty party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> A change? </seg>
<seg id="47"> Not in view </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation which a investment team maritime administration already works on over a year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> "This, however, is not yet taken to any specific conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Buses do absolutely not stand either on the agenda, rather the scoring system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones in the event of that one ride ", so specialist Hoín. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> "this traffic department considers the activity of the stewards not than something, that to endanger the safety of the travellers considerably can", so Hanzelka which the control of the security of the buses is near in the competence of the police and the industrial safety authorities. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Düsseldorfer hopes rest on Frankfurt </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Great words are not missing in the letter of the WestLB executive board onto the staff of the house. </seg>
<seg id="3"> "The central capital market house of the savings bank Finanzgruppe" can arise through a combining of units of the Düsseldorfer bank with the Frankfurter, it is said in the writing become known on Monday. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The first would bring one "Competence block" with sustainable little in a such business one. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And anyway a such link can be the decisive impulse to further grouping in the state bank sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> So it reads itself if an executive board wants to demonstrate in a difficult time act. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Because the hit WestLB stands still under tremendous pressure. </seg>
<seg id="8"> To find a future solution not only on the part of the European Commission, but also through the Federal Institution for financial service supervision who explained only recently the nordrhein-westfälischen central government the time is urgent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Of one as always gearteten combination between the deca-bank, the savings bank customers because of their investment funds know, and the first is, however the speech already for some time - also on Frankfurt side. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Indeed deca-bank chief Franz Waas made be known with the presentation of the semidates at the end of August, in a merger of the house at the cerium main highway with a state bank, about the Helaba or the WestLB, he does not see does not make sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Nevertheless the administration council of the Deka which ever half is carried by the state banks and the savings bank associations charged the executive board to lead talks with the first about common business activities. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In this case it could be a question of the capital market business or parts from that. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The talks have certainly, so it is called at the financial center, just first begun. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It is not talked about the deca-bank which numbers among the most important employers with their 3,000 staff at in the city Frankfurt for the first time if it is a question of consolidation in the savings bank sector. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2003 it long looked a moment so, as if Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba can fuse with the state bank the deca-bank. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Nothing became from this three Federal Government, however. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Hardly the plans had not become public, the Hessische Central Government spoke out against a participation of the Helaba at that. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The two other houses did not find then to each other. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Rheinland-Pfalz state bank went instead of this onto the Baden-Württemberg state bank in Stuttgart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Nevertheless there were again and again thought games about a combination of the deca-bank with state banks. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Last Günther Merl, executive board chairperson of the Helaba, had spoken out, however, against map exercises about a meeting with his house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Independently of that it seems to mature the recognition, however, that a Zusammenrücken of the various houses of the public sector does needed. </seg>
<seg id="23"> After the regional elections is now in Bavaria past, when first a combination of the BayernLB with the Baden-Württemberg state bank could come closer. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For the Helaba that is absolutely not a good information. </seg>
<seg id="25"> if the pressure to further mergers should increase the partners go out after and after it for that. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the south she would be only junior partner, although they has stood the financial crisis up to now by far better as the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A meeting with the west LB in turn the savings bank and endorsement association Hessen-Thüringen that is participated in the Helaba with 85 percent at the beginning of the year shot a barrier. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The north LB would stay if need be. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Such geostrategic are, however only one side. </seg>
<seg id="30"> On the other one it is the question of the question as the different business models of the individual houses match. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In June Merl expressed, the decisive question with the business model the future ability of the state banks is supposed to be guaranteed was not answered by the German savings bank and Endorsement Association up to now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> At the end the west LB could stand also a dismantling that, however, is not wanted there of course. </seg>
<seg id="33"> So it is talked then also in the letter of the nonlocal executive board of that, it becomes in any case one "all-in solution" for the house targeted. </seg>
<seg id="34"> How that with the meeting of individual units with the can be brought under a hat will still be proved. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The German banking system is relatively stable, federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück stressed first in that one lasted week. </seg>
<seg id="3"> How good, that the politicians the word "relative" use and also still inserted, that the German banking sector of the troubled developments is not spared to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Because that one kicked in at the weekend now. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The inhabitant of Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) noted down in the Dax receives a billions of credit from a consortium of German banks in order to shield oneself from the turbulence at the markets. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A with the situation familiar person, said Reuters on Monday, the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Hypo Real Estate must pay only on the part which it also uses interest. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The money comes both of private and public banks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Losses are background with the daughter Depfa. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Staatsfinanzierer had refinanced itself extremely for a short period of time according to a newspaper report for long period of time projects for which it lent money - what meanwhile because of the suspicion at the markets more is not possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> In the first half of 2008 the cash reserve of the bank had shrunk to 95 per cent on 2,37 million euro, also the equity had given easily from 1,6 on 1,45 percent. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The running profits and net revenue deriving from financial transactions had fallen opposite the period last year onto zero, the proceeds sunk from ascription to demands and certain securities as well as from the dissolution from accrued liabilities in the credit business around more than 70 per cent on 5 million euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Only thanks to higher profits from payments of subordinate settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as from the payment of interests according to the tax and from the business errand for Associated Companies, the profit minus with about 16 percent had made drop out still moderat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The formerly Staatsfinanzierer had after his privatisation in 1990 at first with commercial borrowing capabilities verspekuliert, that then in the Aareal Bank ausgegliedert were. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Because one earned too little in the classical state financing, the Depfa had intensified then in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint efforts of private investors and the state engages (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Onto the value of the daughter the Hypo Real Estate must carry out now writing-off that will have an "essential physical effect" on the typical of the group be called it quite indefinitely. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The fact is that the dividend was deleted. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Already for 2007 it had been abbreviated around two thirds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The Hypo Real Estate is since the Depfa incorporation an important State - and Infrastrukturfinanzierer. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is stronger than other institutes of the refinance at the interbank market dependent, since she does not have any customer deposits. </seg>
<seg id="21"> With the breakdown of the American investment bank of Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the lending versiegt among banks again to a large extent since the banks hoard their solvency. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Hypo Real Estate needs annually short-term funds to refinancing for a part - about 50 billion euros - of the Kreditportfolios of the Depfa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> After communication of the Hypo Real Estate, the need for the group is covered with the credit onto the foreseeable future and that enterprise "of the influence of the currently to a large extent inoperative international ones money market" screen. </seg>
<seg id="24"> From other sources it is to be heard that thanks to the money the refinance is safeguarded until end of 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The HRE executive board chairperson Georg Funke declared, on the other hand that the Hypo Real Estate Group more will not have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Bundesbank and the Federal Institution for financial service supervision (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Gruppe is now safeguarded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> That is entitled to for shareholders and creditors of the bank hope. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But faced with the dynamism and Unwägbarkeiten of the crisis there is not is no certainty. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not even unconceivable that the funding does not have to be used in full extent. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But also the opposite is not to be split off. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> After at on Late Sunday evening according to the hearing the bank still stood before the bankruptcy also at least temporary rescue is able not to calm the feelings. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The share price starts by 75% on 3,30 euro. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> On the other hand quite well the lending transactions hold themselves. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The priority debts do not last in a hardly in motion way show, the courses of the Nachrang-Anleihen drop more clearly. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Particularly the loans of the former subsidiary company Württemberg Hypo and understandably the more than 2009 exceeding terms are affected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If hypo-real - Estate - loans seem a speculative annex alternative formerly whose stipulating must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system so after the clear sharpening of the banking crisis and the institute itself which with the incorporation of the Depfa the crisis had gotten to itself first into the house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> For so long the central banks, governments and less hit commercial bank for to support the system still ready are, for so long a proud eradication of pensions can be gone out of. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Or however it what somebody currently hardly yet dares to hope comes - that the financial crisis is overcome in the next 15 months. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> However faced with the announcements somersaulting with the partial nationalisation only an entitled hope currently became from the probability verging on security. </seg>
<seg id="40"> That might prepare some sleepless nights with the decision whether they are supposed to separate from their commitment particularly for long-term believers. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce himself on the first school day at the Tachibana Highschool the girl start giggling: The German is totally "kawaii"! </seg>
<seg id="3"> What means that? </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas - in the new exchange bonfire it tells about Japan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "this first school day in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I was annoyed. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Already before the way to school I had fear. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I live on the fringe of Tokyo in direction Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the Tachibana Highschool. </seg>
<seg id="9"> I had to find the way alone, for the luck I did not get lost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The teaching beginning does not seem as severe definedly at the Tachibana as with us at home in Lower Saxony. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The pupils arrive from 8 p.m., to twenty in front of nine a short meeting round with the teachers begins, this' home room '. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> However before the education began, I was at the series, to introduce me. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In this case I am not at all for this purpose the model which speaks with pleasure before people who before a class of 40 pupils yet. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because I did not have yet any school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my visitor mother, for this purpose blouse, blue knee-length socks and black leather shoes. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In this lift I positioned myself therefore before the bench and attempted to express everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana.' - I am called Sylvana, come from Germany and have in a week birthday. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In the moment I was very glad, that I had begun already before good two years ago, to learn the language. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The 31 girls in the class whispered all, giggled and gewunken and continuously I have the word "Kawaii" belong. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I knew that already from my Mangas. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It appertains to the survival - important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means' sweet, sweeten '. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Then I darted quickly onto my place. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The girl next to me grinned quite broad, she found an honour it, that the exchanges between pupils should be next to it. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The rest of the moment was quite calm, however, when the gong sounded, I was assailed downright. </seg>
<seg id="23"> All talked durcheinander and giggled and asked me punctures into the gut - in this case it is really heavy to understand Japanese English. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the break all their Bentos unpacked then. </seg>
<seg id="25"> My official mother had made me also such a lunch box - that is once something different than the dull German tracing breads. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I had rice with herbs and spices, small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Mostly I do not have not got clue, which I eat here in Japan exactly. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The things look strange and taste completely novel. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Firmly it is that everything is really delicious. </seg>
<seg id="30"> 'Oh well, up to the saltily pickled plums maybe, brrrr! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The Bentos are not lunch at Japanese schools only one - times. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It happens sometimes that a girl gives a young a self prepared Bento that prepares it especially artistic then - in the hope to become acquainted with the boy near the Pausensnack nearer. </seg>
<seg id="33"> From that I read in my Manga - cartoons. </seg>
<seg id="34"> I am once tense, whether I can also observe that here. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> 'why then it is Japan?', my friends asked to me when I told to them that I want to go into Tokyo to school for a year. </seg>
<seg id="36"> I always said then: </seg>
<seg id="37"> "Because it fascinates me now." </seg>
<seg id="38"> Finally I already for years most with pleasure read Mangas. </seg>
<seg id="39"> And so that I understand the cartoons and the culture in that better to learn a bit Japanese, I began also sometime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> For me it was therefore completely clear that I had to travel sometime here. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Because I also have weak spot for tradition, customs and practices. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And onto those ones one puts is great value. </seg>
<seg id="43"> On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is severe, disciplined and traditional. </seg>
<seg id="44"> And because everything is so well organized, I felt not lost here also yet even if Tokyo is the biggest city which I ever saw. " </seg>

<seg id="7"> I believe that animals have feelings and other awareness states without otherwise I or somebody being able to prove this up to now where we can not even prove that other people have awareness. </seg>
<seg id="8"> However, in this case we may hope at least since all human brains show the same basic configuration. </seg>
<seg id="9"> As soon as we turn to other species, however, and touch questions of the opinion or generally more of consciousness, we enter unwegsames ground because the hardware does not agree. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> If a rat in danger takes, she does the same thing as many other animals: She surrenders in a dead way, flees or attacks. </seg>
<seg id="11"> People behave similarly, to close from which some scientists onto a comparable subjective experience. </seg>
<seg id="12"> I do not believe in that, however. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Two aspects of the brain structural make it difficult to apply our subjective experience to that from animals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> On the one hand the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the side prefrontal Cortex (because of his participation in the short-term memory and at the Ausfuehrungs - / control functions). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This broad region is much more highly developed with the human being than with the remaining primates and seems with other creatures to be missing entirely. </seg>
<seg id="16"> To plan at least with those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex under that the knowledge, who we are, and the ability and to decide, reason to believe exists therefore, that the human being distinguishes even from the other primates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> A further dramatic character might lie in the linguistic nature of the people: Since a so big part of his experience is combined with language, it is said often the awareness depends on that. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this case one could exclude animals. </seg>
<seg id="19"> However, even if conscience did not depend on language, this would influence it certainly so that animal consciousness as it likes to be also to get it would be distinguished from most of our Bewusstseins-zustaende probably very much. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Therefore it is heavy to investigate how awareness likes to look at other animals. </seg>
<seg id="21"> When it, as something Intern and Subjective, neither do not measure yet, because of the specific hardware, analyze by means of our own experience makes, so his research into puts us before major problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Most of my comments refer to the contents of the conscious experience, nevertheless there is next to that another further aspect of the consciousness which might be scientifically more simply accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> One could examine the processes of awareness of animals without regard for their content, and happen exactly that with studies about the short-term memory of primacy, in particular at the example of the visualization. </seg>
<seg id="24"> However with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed one rather resorts to the neuralen correlatives of consciousness than onto the causal mechanism: Both like to be identical or neither. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Interestingly enough this approach accentuates also the importance of the prefrontal Cortex for the materialization of the visualization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> what turns out now for the feelings? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I would drive it back on an emotional system as that of the fear being activated in a brain, conscious of his own activity. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What we as "fear" describe, the mental state in which we are if main memory proves the activity of the defence system localized in the brain (or its consequences such as physical reactions) is therefore. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Feelings are so seen tied to the areas of the Cortex that distinguish primates and in particular the people closely. </seg>
<seg id="30"> fine varying degrees of the surrenders to Combined with the linguistic nature because we can differentiate situations with the aid of the words and the grammar and categorize states in order to ascribe it also to other ones next to us ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> On the other hand Antonio Damasio thinks for example that feelings follow from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the Cortex and the brain stem similar to Jaak Pankseep, who concentrates on the brain stem more, however. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Since this network did not change in the course of human evolution very much, it can be participated in kind - comprehensive feelings absolutely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> In that in theory I can not contradict that, it holds, however, for unprovable. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Pankseep argues, what appears with rats and people like fear probably feels so also in two cases: how, however, can one check whether rats and people feel the same thing if they behave similarly? </seg>
<seg id="35"> A cockroach flees in the case of danger whether also she feels fear? </seg>
<seg id="36"> In my eyes bare similar behaviour can not prove yet any experience equality. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Indeed the neurale arrangement keeps on helping: Rats and people have similar brain tribes, cockroaches on the other hand not even a brain. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But is the brain stem responsible for feelings? </seg>
<seg id="39"> And even if one could prove that for the people: How did one want to prove it at rats? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> I believe, that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), feelings have. </seg>
<seg id="41"> But I would not know how I should prove that. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And because their feelings are presumably distinguished from ours basically (since the human consciousness is based on specific circuits and on language), I investigate more with pleasure the emotional behaviour than the emotional feelings of rats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Anyway progress beckons here on the neuralen tier provided that one measures the same thing with rats and people. </seg>
<seg id="44"> How I do not investigate language and awareness at rats, so neither feelings, I know nevertheless not, whether they exist. </seg>
<seg id="45"> One likes to hold that for shortsighted, but I come more with pleasure ahead than to walk continuously against a wall. </seg>
<seg id="46"> I am now more practical emotional ist. </seg>

<seg id="7"> In order to close this service distance, Obama education action plan recommends a bilingual in particular among other ones in the training for those ones who learn English first. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Nevertheless the question exists at Obama darin whether his use contradicting his interest for the bilingual training that puts which focuses on onto instruction in other languages than English reducing the distance in the sportsmen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> let's take "Sixth Street Prep" a primary school, as an example in eastern Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Is The majority of pupils hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> More than one third parties of the pupils from whom many are not before recently in the country learn English. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Nevertheless 100 percent of pupils of the fourth class passed the public examination into 2008 amazing ones in Mathe on a good level. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Also surprisingly 93 per cent of children were valued as good from the fourth school year in the English examination. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This astonishing success was achieved with other methods, as those ones that are preferred by Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The school Sixth Street puts its focus, onto permanent control of the knowledge and an attitude which does not tolerate no exceptions, on inspection and practice. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Furthermore the school practises the approach to which the training proceeds in a English-speaking surroundings. Exactly that the point which Obama is supposed to pay attention to, according to the headmistress Linda Mikels is. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This approach puts importance onto the almost exclusive use of the English language in the compartment instruction. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Woman of Mikels, who refuses the idea of bilingual training, said to me the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil who only shortly before had come from Mexico. 12 months later one would enter the schoolroom before and would not recognize could it anymore. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "It functions", she said, "it functions for us". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Obama would become a school how this "Sixth Street Prep" as model for other schools with great proportion at Latin American and other English learning pupils take? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The performance of the school would make the answer to this question easy, however, the formation - political positions within his of own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen already long support the idea of bilingual training) and his own unstinting support for the bilingual training do answer to predictions uncertainly above Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> While he is agreeing to the point, that immigrants should learn English, it trivialisiert the issue recently in his saying that people should stop to make oneself for worries about the legislation aiming at "only English". </seg>
<seg id="23"> Instead of this, he said: "her are supposed to guarantee, that their child Spanish can". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If Obama wants to close the service distance in fact, he is supposed to consider carefully education systems that function instead of despising it and trivialisieren. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Favre found Coles in this quarter for another two Touchdowns, the one time as an outside defender slipped and that other once 10 seconds in front of the end of the half. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> "I has me not especially tire", Coles about the passports says that to Coles went. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the maddest. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds remaining in the game than the jets reconquered the ball and Jay Feely changed one 20 yard shot to the 34 to 0 leadership. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia pointed again, why some hold him for the best distance runner of all time after it broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first Menschen to get the route from 42,2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> With the victory on the flat course in 2 03 59 previous result which it had achieved last year in Berlin improved Gebrselassie to his from 2:04:26 around 27 seconds. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Gebrselassie, 35, set up in this way his 26th world record in his multifaceted career, in which it reaches at least a world cup title on every route of a kilometre until the marathon or made a world record. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Last month Gebrselassie let out the olympic Marathon in Beijing, for fear that it was afterwards maybe exaggerated that the air pollution could verschlimmern his asthma problems. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Instead of this he enrolled itself for the race in Berlin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the destination - Gebrselassie with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile won. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Since railway stars as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat changed from Kenya on long routes, is the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years fell around more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo obtained Costa there from Brazil in the year 1998 in Berlin with the result 2 06 05. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> 05 has won. According to his victory on Sunday Gebrselassie of the press informed, he would have had cramps two weeks ago in his Wade and it could not train therefore a week. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Obviously is refreshed it after break and rustedly not come back. </seg>

<p>

<seg id="13">  I resumed the training a week ago and had some objections today still, nevertheless at the end what of everything super. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> It was criticized for that - in particular in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from east Africa - that he orchestrates his running - races excessively, a lot of world - best Marathonstars general avoids, too very much onto the running - chiefs quits, when whether that would be a railroad race, and puts world records about the race. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But this criticism hardly damages the size of Gebrselassies as distance runners. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday Accompanied had reached the heart of the line in 1:02:04. </seg>
<seg id="17"> 04 reached. Two elite stars from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi kept on provoking Gebrselassie, after the speed makers had decreased. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Something more than three miles before the finish did Gebrselassie his last start in order to separate from Kwambai that when second in 2:05:36 has arrived and so that his best time improved around almost 5 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Kamathi became third parties in 2:07:48. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> 01 arrived. The pride and the strains in the life of the black population, in a city in the very particular kind of </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> a calm city in which the pride and the complications of the Afro - American culture come is, a few miles remote of the twinkling, loud and gigantic driving, hidden between the outgrowths of leisure parks within a radius of Orlando. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home town Zora Neale Hurstons, is more as simply not to be described as Hurston did it in 1935: "this city with 5 lakes, three croquet places, 300 brown skins 300 good swimmers do, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nowadays it is a pilgrim place. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Come festival in Eatonville around the most famous authoress of the Harlem Renaissance commemorate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And nevertheless is and the city that describes it stays - and that they did to a tourist place of excursions, when she incorporated it into the Florida tour guide, that to the times of economic recession was produced of the federal writer project's - in a lot respect a place of very specific variety. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Eatonville is so independently, solidly and privately as in the 1930ern when Hurston wrote that rural black municipalities often refused to share their true idea with the white man in Florida this "so little white about us, that he does not know what escapes it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Even nowadays, in a year in that a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, to one open conversation about race circumstances calls, it keeps on being many here, to be observed by mavericks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "we are considered very on that as our history told becomes", so Hortense Jones, 59, from birth at a resident of the city and parishioner of the oldest church of the city. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It must be right. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> a long time was defined as a Paradox of triumph and the fight to Eatonville. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is both a historic example of the black movement and a municipality of almost 2.400 inhabitants in which the poverty line is twice as high as the national average. </seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand it a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example is that one - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, that has their roots in the American slavery. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is not surprising, that people here both proud than are also on the guard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And so correctly the concerns began around Eatonville 'it image actually with Zora, as here all Hurston name. </seg>
<seg id="16"> She introduced their home town in books that came of heart and was written in either to the world so as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Five heels in the Florida guide changed the city that suits to the route 77 very near a road that through the oft - forgotten center of Florida leads, to the scenes of black history and human tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Insolently as Oskar both in real life and in the literature, Hurston Leser to the shop of Eatonvilles led first mayor, Joe Clarke, and turned then to more private matters. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "off the road to the left", she wrote ", were the brown - painted modern school, with its leafy gardens and playgrounds which Howard Miller always sees to although he can hardly read and write, knows. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> She mentioned also the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "Drinks of any kind sells and was-auch-immer to time areas fits." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Only in just a few hundred words Hurston brought therefore Eatonville with self-government in combination, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This was not a tour guide ganz sicher. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In Fact this was not a portrait which was valued by all of them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> "Zora the things described so, wie sie waren", so the 90 - year old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls the Hurston immortalized, when them the men the songs about which sang their beauty that was fuller sexual innuendo summoned. </seg>
<seg id="25"> She added: "Some people did not like this." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> One remembers here still Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin who returned regularly after the family had moved according to Jacksonville, Florida. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Augustus of Rome Franklin 77, remembered, that if Hurston came into the city roaredly, they this mostly without warning did, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in trousers in a city the even today something onto their venerable clothing style imagines. </seg>
<seg id="28"> According to Mr Franklin the majority of inhabitants were fascinated, wohingegen many it despised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "this people were always glad Zora to sight", Mr Franklin said. </seg>
<seg id="30"> but "sie stayed never too longest", he added while it was swinging in his chair, on a to the back sited terrace that looks at the Sabelia See in which Hurston was christened according to all probability. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> When Hurston died in 1960 it was poor and its books out of print. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Together with the bulk of the world it seemed to have forgotten to Eatonville. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although she was a famous author once, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard college in the 1920ern, she became in fort Pierce, Florida, where it lived, buried in an unmarked grave. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In Eatonville there was not no great ceremony, no public readings in the big style. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "I thinks not, that they was published your contribution in the world or their heritage in the least understood credit", so Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography above Hurston the 2003. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The turning point came in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Orange County authorities wanted to put a fünfspurige motorway through the city in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main road of the community. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Orlandos suburbs had pushed already the motorway 4 through the western outskirts of a town. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The proposal was made when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in its history. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Mandatory integration, among other things, had put an end the relatively idyllic isolation to the community. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In the fifties the fight brought hatred against racial mixing into the community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "In this time a bunch of white boys came often and they flung oranges and stuff onto those ones off sitting people", Mr Franklin said. </seg>
<seg id="43"> "it even once a woman gave the in this case was killed. </seg>
<seg id="44"> You flung a watermelon from the car. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> In 1955 Orlando Sentinel questioned Hurston in a writing onto that the demand of the Uppermost Court of Justice to force integration when they described his decision in the case Brown against the school council as "offensive instead of my race respecting". </seg>
<seg id="46"> Residents say nowadays, that although the lifting of racial segregation was in a way positive, they the group cohesion in Eatonville and self-assurance its young people weakened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> "Black children were accustomed it, to be embraced - I remember that - one embraced his teacher at on the morning and one embraced his teacher at the evening", so N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managerial directress of the non-profit group to the protection of the Eatonville Gemeinschaft. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> That could be received for so long erectly, she added until teachers and pupils did not come from the same place anymore. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "One did not embrace his white teachers, because he was a white teacher - I mine there is a cultural divide available", Ms Nathiri said ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> However, the civil rights contributed to place being created for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists, that disregarded prejudices, so as she did it, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "as can refuse somebody the joy of my society! </seg>
<seg id="51"> I do not understand it. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In 1975 the writer Alice Walker onto the path turned herself into Hurstons nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of their fame. </seg>
<seg id="53"> An a lot praised Hurston-Biographie of Robert E. Hemenway was to be found five years later in the bookshelves, and made it renewed to a part of the American literature canon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> The distance route project came exactly at a time, in the Eatonvilles most famous daughter again once in the light of the stood. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And this time Hurstons old neighbors saw her as a Retterin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> The community began festival in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston in order to show what the district with the construction of the motorway could destroy. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and each January many return for the celebration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> A few years later the district averted itself from his road construction plans. </seg>
<seg id="59"> "this plans of a fünfspurigen distance route livened up the city, sped up the whole thing with top speed, woke genuine Citizen proud", Ms Nathiri said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Ms Boyd a little more simply squeezed it out: "Zora saved Eatonville." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> The victory against the distance route project contributed to a modification of the selfpicture of the city. </seg>
<seg id="62"> More and more Zugereiste came, so as Rachelle Munson, an attorney that goes into the church since 1993 here, and local began to estimate the past new. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Eatonville was incorporated in 1998 into the national historic register. </seg>
<seg id="64"> A new one-storeyed library (named after Hurston of course) opened in 2006 on the again paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> Nowadays Eatonville still is a special feature in Florida: just 6 miles from the city center of Orlandos it can feel sometimes as a rear lane in the summer rains, as small as then than it was founded only by 27 black families in the 1880ern. </seg>
<seg id="66"> (It is nowadays black to 90%.) </seg>
<seg id="67"> External ones in search of the history Eatonvilles and its importance are handled often still with caution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> For most interviews a approval in the run-up to is necessary and certain things - so as the wall painting of Eatonvilles of oldest church which was painted from a white and represents black men during the work in the fields - must not be photographed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> Many in Eatonville, as Ms Jones, a courageous, teacher, selfconscious that their shielded community is misunderstood, with a penchant for Dunkelrot, fear still. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> And nevertheless, at the same time to which the Hurston-Festival became bigger, also an increased degree at internal pride was born. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Particularly young people tend to seeing Eatonville like this as Hurston saw your whole race: wonderful, with all its problems, neither worse even better and just as proud, creative and industrious, fool around and mixes as any other race and nation group in America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> It is the genuine love for this city that one in the voice of gentlemen Franklins nephew can hear, the 18 - year old Edwin Harvey that plans to return to the college according to Eatonville that could use some help according to it in order to work in the City Council or near the police. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73"> And even the juniors, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven year old twins from winter park, learned to describe Eatonville correctly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> "this most people, that only think here gone on become:" Ach, this city is not anything in comparison with all the other ", Alondra Kenon said recently on Sunday after the church. </seg>
<seg id="75"> "but if in fact one stops and its history long considers a moment, it is a very beautiful city. </seg>

<seg id="20"> 'us the largest of us all has leaving', confirmed George Clooney, maybe one of few, that attempt to dare today to live as Paul Newman lived: high demands on the rectitude receive a responsible private life, to lead far from the cameras away. </seg>

<seg id="1"> For the Olympic Games the streets are deficient in Madrid. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some olympic disciplines in Madrid after the failing for 2012, nevertheless it can be in maybe 2016. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But I ask to myself: ` are we for that prepares'? </seg>
<seg id="4"> Yes, we follow the example of the old streets I say that it is not right! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It was designated as a perfect street, and according to in my opinion, she was the worst street with all for that and at that there was. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That is natural a lot of rubbish if one paid attention to the assessment and I could check it something like that would not have come through unambiguously. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But, let's go through from the outset onto everything. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The nonsense begins with the ticket - getting that allows you when first go. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It does not seem to me either to be bad, however if they make you already go ahead, they should give you also everything then (including crisp, in order to avoid the jams on the road). </seg>
<seg id="10"> Therefore nevertheless not. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Here they make you get just the ticket (the first nonsense to consist in going there only therefore) and (to a never-ending queues) there the surprise is! There was only the satirical T-shirt like in the size 'it' (a second nonsense, because I need the size XL) </seg>
<seg id="12"> where do we live actually? </seg>
<seg id="13"> Or is it so that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts of less substance? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Therefore good, matters like these are a small thing in comparison with the days on the street. </seg>
<seg id="15"> already had a queue of at least 15 minutes is, foreseen of one having to go very early in order to get the chip, and, in addition, one must forget the schoolbag. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The queuing lasted more than 35 minutes what is unintelligible in the case of a street, where 11 000 people are expected. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Finally, as it was also to be expected, the streets caught at and we had not made our moving - bags lie before that even if it had succeeded once, but to fetch it back would be already more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition looked it, in these 40 minutes of waiting for rain, so that it resulted in the temptation, to organize a popular uprising and to raid the cottage. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I believe, some 500 people become tomorrow certainly pneumonia have united and as I to become because of this crisp that I got not even to appear punctual during the classification, I can think already that the outcome was stamped wrongly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Natural, if one asked me for a perfect Road, I would never remember this road. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So I believe, we will dream still long about a city that is good for the Olympic Games prepared </seg>

<seg id="2"> on this' Emerging Technology Conference ', organizes of WITH, Microsoft presented the progress of the new picture labelling system and the human being communication, to order a being of the artificial intelligence without much intelligence that, however, is capable, it unites to finish primitive work, as such a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft that is a distance designer in order to move on the campus of the company).

<seg id="4"> It can classify also present into the groups after the talks. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the presentation video bemerkt 'this Rezeptionistin' one third person, however she understands that this person to the group that leads conversation with it is not corresponding, and that also no farm workers is. </seg>
<seg id="6"> She asks about whether the person wants to visit anyone here and answers that she will soon listen. </seg>
<seg id="7"> All without the blue Screenshot </seg>
<seg id="8"> impressing </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> That is certainly the future. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Now the company has better things which it can be concentrated on, for example onto the next version of their operating system of Windows. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This week one talked very superficially about the change of strategy by Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Windows 7 will be faster and not have as many bound programs. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Steve Ballmer found, that if the computer were endowed with the most necessary instead of filling it with the commercial waste so they would function five times more quickly. Human being, stem, that will be only for the Few ones. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Everything is just a statement if one considers that Microsoft in Windows versions one or other function and 'Extras' add. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The shift is worthwhile </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Microsoft has right, the operating system loses importance by degrees, exactly as the software. </seg>
<seg id="17"> When Google chromium appeared in the network, that was a part of the theory that it is the first step of Google in order to compete with Windows. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Sent many referred to the browser not being an operating system. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The operating system, as an indispensable part, will be always necessary so that hardware and software can function simultaneously. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The operating system fulfills the function which can be compared with the function of his wife or his her husband if it is a question of informing his mother-in-law of something. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> That is right. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The system will never disappear, however one must at his' death ', not as an absolute, but as relative truth, think. </seg>
<seg id="23"> What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The people give each time less attention to the operating system, for that more the web browser. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The computer exports only started, around the Firefox, the Explorer or chromium and every day we spend more time at the surfing, than in the environment this' window '. </seg>
<seg id="26"> what does the half serve for in the computers of existing applications? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Little is more </seg>
<seg id="28"> And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista must. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Easier, not so exaggerated, complicated little. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The interest of Microsoft exists more in integrating his on-line services that then can become, finally, the alternative to Google. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the reality they need that, without doubt. I bring a small example of that. </seg>
<seg id="32"> I did the photograph of this place in talking - moon in one of the recovery rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. </seg>
<seg id="33"> on the soft drink machine is a shield attaches: 'your search. Ours future'. A request prints, to use own tool for online search. </seg>
<seg id="34"> In 2006 an independent study came at the end of, that the 66% of the employees at Microsoft, Google for the research on the network was useful. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> After all, last week was also confirmed, that the new version of the Windows Mobile 7 is guessed in the delay. </seg>
<seg id="36"> It does not become initially, but at the end of 2009 appear, rather even 2010. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Microsoft seeks to bring the possibility, Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously on the mark. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Every day the telephone changes itself in a computer. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money. </seg>

<seg id="12"> In Any Case, that is a little bit investigated phenomenon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The frequency with which it appears is very variable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It can be that one speaks calmly in individual words whispers or it can completely be an opposite (Shouts, wines long debates). </seg>
<seg id="15"> In the cases if the comment is very intense it is recommended to observe the child that causes fear and is achieved in this way and to make be advised with a specialist in order to check whether there is a problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> We said that it is a positive disruption, therefore it is not handled, it is united with another sleep trouble, which can be handled (for example, with the Schlaf-Apnoe or with the stress). </seg>
<seg id="17"> What one can do is, one series of simple preventative measures would go on: </seg>
<seg id="18"> Attempt not to excite the child before the sleeping. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Therefore, calm game for the child select and stressige channels that terribly and a little are too wild avoid. </seg>
<seg id="20"> With the nervous children who expansions are recommended to extension methods in order to help them to get a certain amount inner calm can be used. </seg>
<seg id="21"> That helps the child with sleeping calmly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> If the talk occurs in the sleep once, attempts to preserve the rest. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Thinks, that it is harmless for the child and on the next day will not be able to remember anything that happened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Useful advice </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Do not wake it on. </seg>
<seg id="26"> That is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it from the sleep. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Although the child speaks, sleeps it, therefore it rests. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Think of that if it is proved according to a few phenomena verängstigt, so it is recommended to make oneself be advised or to find out what is the reason the baby has for the fear. </seg>
<seg id="29"> if they understand what does not say it (what is not so usual), the child does not put under pressure, in order to carry out an interrogation and to figure out more information. </seg>
<seg id="30"> So you will not be able to achieve anything in this way, because if the baby sleeps, is unconscious it and can not think about that. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In addition, you will hear what says it, but you will not know what dreams it and why it says that, therefore they are cautious with the interpretation of the information and that ends that draws her from that. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Maybe, do not say it to the child, that to hear you that at night and to know his secrets. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Not even as joke. </seg>
<seg id="34"> That causes a lot of fear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Therefore, does not do you no concerns, it is not anything bad, that is a moment that lasts only a few minutes. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Meeting - Of from the blood, that again secure became </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary their creation yesterday, and their president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all reason to be pleased, because Hema-Quebec became one of the most secure and most efficient blood banks of the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And particularly she retrieved the confidence of the public which had been shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980th and 1990th years heavily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As one knows, the national blood reserves managed from the blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated during the 1980th years with the HIV and hepatitis C virus. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Faced with this tragedy and the discontent public the government of Canada initiated in February 1994 an investigation public, seen through the judge Horace Krever that to the goal it had to bring light into the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and to prevent to elaborate directives, around a renewed disaster of this type of. </seg>
<seg id="6"> while judge Krever was still hesitating with giving his report several provinces set then a committee onto the legs that aim was to develop a new system to the administration of blood in Canada it. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In Quebec the committee Gélineau fulfilled this task. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the reports by Gélineau and Krever two blood banks were set up in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, in order to supply the other provinces and the two territories. </seg>
<seg id="9"> ` 1998 when Hema-Quebec started their work hardly any 38% of people had confidence into the blood preserve system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was discouraging. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Through the enormous efforts around the safety of the blood to improve and through the work on this field during the following years, we have the confidence of the recover ', they says, before it stresses proudly, that at the beginning of 2008 in the meantime almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Dr. Décary keeps, however, in the consciousness, that ` confidence something extremely brittle is'. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since their foundation on 28th September 1998 Hema-Quebec acts according to the principle of caution. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At this time we lived through the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman that holds the leadership since the creation in 1998 tells. </seg>
<seg id="15"> 'and we had not the slightest idea, whether the disease could be transferred via the blood. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Therefore we referred to one of the key directives of the reports by Krever and Gélineau, according to which one uses exclusion measures if one does not know this that leads to death unavoidably and if an illness that is expressed through a degeneration of the brain continues only slowly as it is the case obviously during the Creutzfeldt Jakob illness. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore one did not accept in April 1999 any blood of persons who had detained themselves longer since 1980 than a month in the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Now, few years ago it was proved without any doubt that this disease will transfer via the blood. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So this event showed us that the principle of the caution that we used absolutely has a purpose. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In 1999 a much more precise technique for the recognition of HIV appeared on the market: To prove the Nukleinsäure tests (NST) that facilitate it directly in the blood of the donor the occurrence of the virus itself, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as it was the case at the up to now used tests. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The NST made it possible to reduce the incubation period that between the time when, to which the person was infected and that, if the first viruses can be proved by our techniques in the blood, occurs, the specialist declares. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This time could be reduced to a period by little as a week. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The risk became like this that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, considerably reduced. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These improvements facilitated it, the risk, to assign AIDS about a blood transfusion to lower in considerable extent. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Nowadays one of 12 million persons runs danger, with HIV infected blood keep. </seg>
<seg id="26"> ` in other words that is called, that one would have to distribute 12 million blood conserves before somebody was infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400 and 500 blood every year, it would last more than 24 years before a case occurs with the HIV about a blood conserve transferred. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I believe, that one can feel well in this case nowadays if one gets a blood transfusion or prescribes a blood transfusion around the health reconstruct ', the direction head of Hema-Quebec means. </seg>
<seg id="29"> ` our challenge for the next ten years it is, the safety of our products to receive. </seg>
<seg id="30"> One never knows how germs can reach into the system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Only in last year the Chikungunya virus emerged on the island Reunion, which will transfer, just the same as the west Nile virus, through insects on the blood. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We must 'control' constant ', Dr. Décary goes on before it stresses that Hema-Quebec must in addition provide a secure supply next to sufficient supply. </seg>
<seg id="33"> ` this demand climbs, because the population ages. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Since the treatments for cancer is more aggressive, the patients need often new red blood cells or blood platelets. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The of the population affects also the blood donor net, to which on average only 3% the to the blood donations appertain appropriate inhabitants of Quebec. </seg>

<seg id="10"> Although it was mentioned recently frequently in the speeches of the prime minister, the aperture of the North was - the northern field on the 49sten degree of latitude - still not been ever subject of a presentation. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The prime minister restricted himself to that, however, declare, why the north 'one jewel with enormous potential' were, named, however, not a date, no investment figures or exact priorities for the next projects. </seg>
<seg id="12"> At most some views on which could be worked on more: Favored by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure particularly at the water vigor, at the forest, but especially at the mining industry sector. </seg>

<seg id="17"> 'it appertains us, it is ours future', he added to consider after his having inserted a theatrical break around the huge card behind itself. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The north, 70% of the area of Quebec, closes a part that Quebec always demanded from Labrador, the prime minister declared opposite the press. </seg>
<seg id="19"> ` this a traditional attitude that all governments pursued is. </seg>

<seg id="31"> ` as the liberals, which were before us in office, we thought, around the challenges in new Growth - and to change Entwicklungschanchen. </seg>
<seg id="32"> This was after all one of the again and again raised topics of the weekend which was revealed to of the party leadership on Friday with a great cocktail party for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the through Jean Lesage. </seg>
<seg id="33"> One of the accepted decisions plans to rename the power station of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm. </seg>
<seg id="34"> ` of Godbout that has to create Hydro-Quebec to determine the future to Bourassa that did the James bay, our party always knew, over Lesage that achieved the quiet revolution and the nationalization of the water current ', declared Jean Charest. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Opposite the press he took Bezug onto another, this time conservative project, and indeed on the program 'Roads to the North' of John Diefenbaker prime minister from 1957 to 1963. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="39"> It stresses that his agenda, however, is full particularly because of a mission of the community council in China and a peak between Quebec and New York. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The General Assembly on weekend provided the liberal a party leader with a platform from nationalistischen plans, particularly from ` this constitution concerning destinations' that were accepted without further: The PLQ completely requires particularly the recognition the ` special feature of Quebec 'in the Constitution. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Free view - The orwellsche speech of Barrick Gold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Le Devoir published in its edition of the 17th September a letter of Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian gold mine Barrick Gold. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms, and hunts in this case a Orwellian, that the largest gold extraction society of the world strove for a libel destitute publishing house more than six million against three authors and one small, with the destination, to start 'transparent debate' one ` public. </seg>
<seg id="4"> if it is right that the judges are independent and impartial, then they judge not the truth, particularly not in the case of slander complaints, but the law. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As expects, this fundamental difference was completely hidden by Mr Garver. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Because for Barrick Gold it is to lead the kind, best to drive everyone into the ruin that dares to represent an opinion countered theirs with public debate one. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Very same as the process goes out that authors and the editor of the book considerable sums that are paid to of the gold mine from the almost inexhaustible pockets will have to distribute noir Canada in order to prepare their defence and to fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The tactic in these unequal fight is by the way often to ruin the defenders in order to force an agreed regulation that makes the other side mouth - dead and in addition deters everyone that risks it renewed with the question to deal. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If in fact Barrick Gold wanted a public debate, she would have had to present their vision of things before the of public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the contrast to what in many that one is to countries in which Barrick Gold works gang und gäbe debates are usually delivered in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not through stick blows. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It would have sufficed therefore, when the gold mine their books and files disclosed and would have opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent checking - teams that could have brought light into this issue. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But Barrick Gold seems not to have no confidence into the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to in support of the authors aside from noir Canada with a hand. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Mr Garver could declare maybe, as it simultaneously about one ` public 'Debate can ask and to disregard but the views very this in this case? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apparently this word contains in the world of the vice-presidents only the on a large-scale paid attorneys, and not the community all Canadians; a very beautifully restricted viewpoint of the term. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy even the detractors have to speak the right. </seg>
<seg id="16"> What Barrick Gold does not understand - or not wants to understand - it is that the public that supports the authors and editors of noir Canada does this particularly therefore because she refuses the brutal attitude of the gold mine. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This public is ready for listening to Barrick and judging, however, on the basis of a civilized replacement of arguments, and not in a framework, which many perceive as silence complaint (in the course this' public debate 'has Barrick Gold just a request addressed to the authors from noir Canada, in which it demands from them, not to use this term more.). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Foreseen from the surrealen speech from Mr Garver, the complaint of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the Wahrheitsfindung that are fundamental for any democratic society. </seg>
<seg id="19"> She completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss about facts and interpretations which form the basis of the intellectual work. </seg>
<seg id="20"> To investigate issues, when it is impossible in a country like Canada, and to discuss, which the rich do this world do not like, who otherwise can do that then? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If in fact Barrick Gold wanted a public and open debate, it could lead these in her following the scientific norms which were used by the authors of noir Canada. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It has a right to answer. </seg>
<seg id="23"> To get the on-campus environment to which we belong, white for a long time, debates and inconsistencies in the control and to solve conflicts. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold shows clearly that she does not have no desire for a transparent debate, unlike what she sets. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is a loss for the university world, just the same as for the public debate, and it becomes time that the governments take measures that restrict this kind of unwarranted complaints. </seg>

<seg id="9"> The negotiations had sped up during the last two hours, for fear of the effect which would have had a renewed failing onto the mood of investors. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The period of time which had been agreed was the market opening this morning. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The two American premiership candidates that participated in the negotiations first late rather showed themselves than proponents of the agreement without failing, however, to be expressed their dissatisfaction about that one must hit they in these extreme way. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The democratic senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain decrees for agreement, particularly such that is supposed to make to keep their homes for the owners possible it, and such that the salaries of the executives of the enterprises saved by state concern. </seg>
<seg id="13"> ` if one asks the taxpayer for that, to take extraordinary measures due to of the irresponsibility certain people, is not that anything which one could congratulate oneself on. </seg>
<seg id="14"> However these measures are necessary ', he declared on the American television channels. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When it was asked on another channel, whether he will vote for the suggested plan, his republican opponent John McCain answered: ` I would know with pleasure first the details, however I hopes it. </seg>
<seg id="16"> ` this guiding principles that I read [to show], that this is a matter, that we all will have to digest, and with that one we are able to get on. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The option, not to do anything at all, is very simply not acceptable ', he said. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The 700 billion the action plan is achieved on that, with the money 'taxpayers </seg>
<seg id="19"> It comes 14 months after a crisis, activated by the bursting of an immovable bulrush, that at first for the collapse the risk - rich mortgage credit (subunison) led, before they stretched loans' more spread onto other forms (PCAA), and finally into a freezing of the financial clout and into the ruin of the banks and financial institutions ended. </seg>
<seg id="20"> A group of Republican member was it, that made the first attempt to reach agreement fail last week. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Since the democrats accepted, that certain ` poisonous' To be supposed to be safeguarded assets of societies in trouble only from the government and to be bought for Aktiva of the societies, one believes the dead-end street escape. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In order to round off the visual angles for all in Congress, one added also a decree that says that it can raise new taxes then if the government with this program should do losses within five years in order to get back so their used capital. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The new plan plans the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion that further 100 billion can join if the president looks it for necessary. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The extra 350 billion must be adopted in a renewed vote by Congress. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In return for his aid receives Washington parts at the supplementary enterprises that are to him worth in the case of win dividends, and that it can sell again if the storm has moved by. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Federal Government will have the possibility to stop the seizure procedures concerning the apartments which are tied to the mortgage loans affected from this plan, and in addition to set periods of time for the redemption and the compensations which are paid to the executives of the affected enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The developers of the plan would have it with pleasure, that the chamber of deputies already votes on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In spite of all their efforts is not secure that your plan will get green light yet. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In fact more votes arose yesterday against this intention, both on the part of the Republicans as well the Democrats. </seg>
<seg id="30"> ` whole obvious Washington understands us not ', the republican Scott Garett, member of the financial commission of the chamber, declared to his constituents. </seg>
<seg id="31"> ` yes, we have a big financial problem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Yes, there are solutions. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But not the one that consists in that the taxpayers the foot bill to bitten '. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The democratic representative Brad Sherman, conductor of a group in Congress, this' this Kaukus the sceptic 'genannt becomes, represents the situation differently, comes, however, to the same conclusion. </seg>
<seg id="35"> ` four a hundred excellent economy professors, under that three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us in order to communicate too: We ask the congress for not making oneself be put under pressure, and considering carefully what path is to be taken ', it declared yesterday. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The psychology of the outdoing - or why we are ready to pay more </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the case of auctions the customers tend to issuing more and überbewerten the Feilgebotene thus. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Neurologists and economic researchers of the university of New York succeeded now in discovering the neurologic - economic basics of this familiar and seemingly irrational behaviour. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a study published in the "Science" magazine the people do not want to give themselves beatenly in a competition, as such an auction on, and are therefore ready to pay even excessive prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The researchers attempted to find out the neurologic scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A group of volunteers should play National while the other one was participating in on action - in both cases the acting brain regions of the probands were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> With two play the participants could extract money, however, an increased activity of the Striatum, a complex below the brain rind, with losers of the auction in the case of which the outdoing of the rival plays an important role was measured. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Next to many other functions this brain region is for this "selfreward" of the nervous system responsible. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The researchers thought therefore the price could be explained through the avoidance of a Überreaktion of the Striatums. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In order to support their thesis, the economists did investigations to follow the money in the research group besides. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In This Case three groups should offer against a partner under different conditions. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The inspection was informed of the true value of the product, after that they did their operations. </seg>
<seg id="13"> 15 dollar reward were in addition promised to another group, for the case, that they emerge as winners out of the game. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The third group received 15 dollars in front of the auction which were also lost in the case of a lost game. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The difference between two groups consisted therefore only in that, that the accentuation at one on the winning lay, during at the other one on the losing. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Expressed by neurologists as an evidence for those ones hypothesis however the members of the group playing "against the losing" to higher operations were ready, as those in the Control - and/or. the "profit" group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "These results can not be derived from any previous economic theory. </seg>
<seg id="18"> These justified indeed up to now the behavior observed in the case of auctions only with the joy about the winning, and/or risk avoidance. </seg>

<seg id="5"> The symptoms are often similar - bowel liver and jaundice are frequent, however, the pathogens and the diseases distinguish from each other. </seg>
<seg id="6"> According to virus the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: with hepatitis A and E through the digestion row (for example through contaminated food or water), with hepatitis B, C and D the viruses through blood and other body liquids can will transfer (as about sperm or, secretion juncture or spittle). </seg>
<seg id="7"> An inoculation is recommended to travellers anyway against the viruses A and B, against the virus C there is not no vaccine. </seg>

<seg id="9"> After that the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can two - for three weeks last. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Worldwide approximately 1 million dies. people at the illnesses caused from hepatitis B, far more difficult as cancer of the liver and hepatic cirrhosis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Main reason for that is that according to it is estimated only every tenth infected is in medikamentöser processing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Also hepatitis C can have serious consequences: in an untreated way it can lead to hepatic cirrhosis and cancer of the liver. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Most infected do not know answer even about their illness since the pathogen destroys the liver insidiously - in many cases the first symptoms are proved after 20-30 years. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Therefore punctual bending forward, as such regular inspections, is vital. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There are three groups in which the disease occurs more frequently: those who subjected themselves to a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed ones. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Currently the number of the ones Sick at chronic hepatitis C becomes worldwide on 200 million. estimated. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Scientists of Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment: It was examined, the British one announced to what extent the believe in God influences the pain view of the people leaf "telegraph". </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the course of the rather bizarre investigation ever 12 Believers and atheists received electric shocks while they were studying a painting of the Mother God. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the results showed the believers could eliminate most of the pain. </seg>
<seg id="6"> By means of a Hirn-Scan Technologie it could even be proved that the Catholics could activate the part of their brain which is responsible for the pain regulation. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The investigation was the first in an research project which next to scientists also philosophers and theologians of different sections of the University participate in. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> During the experiment a sparkling device that gave the electric shocks was tied the probands to the left hand. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The participants were asked for concentrating on two paintings strongly: On the one hand a picture of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other Leonardo there Vincis "ladies with the ermine". </seg>
<seg id="10"> The researchers hoped, that the sight would cause the virgin Mary among the believers a kind of religious trance, while they were selecting picture to Vincis there, because it was hardly distinguished from the same as the other paintings and because it was felt as calming. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The trials spent ever half an hour in a MRI scanners, and received in this time a total 20 electric shocks in four stages while they were should notice either the religious one, or the other paintings. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Catholics told, they would have themselves with at the sight of the Mother God "out of danger" felt, as if sie "worried" wae ren, and they hätten "rest and peace" felt. </seg>
<seg id="13"> During the considering of the religious painting they reported about 12% less pain, than if they had Leonardos factory before eyes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The psychologist Miguel Farias that participated also in the attempt meant, one could cause similar effects also with pictures other, working strongly also with the atheists, one would have to find the photograph bare. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "We would have to find a picture which activates very positive feelings as such a mother or a father", according to the psychologist. </seg>

<seg id="17"> "this Practise of faith our personality should change, and it does also in many felling", so Wright. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Schmidt declared, Google is after ten years of world - changing work still only at the beginning of the information - compiling. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Asked for the Status Quo in five years Schmidt meant: he wanted Google would be in the situation "questions as" Which I "am supposed" to do "tomorrow"? or "which job" suits me in fact "? answer, however software programmes are not yet since they would not know enough about the users in the situation for this purpose. </seg>

<seg id="13"> A perfect example for that was recently the action taken against Pädophilie in Brazil, in the course of which Google the Brazilian government presented information which were gathered from the community site by the name of "Orkut" and made also a identification for the Pädophilien possible. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Users, worried about personal rights, could revive, however, still in May, when Google pulled together with the massive datamining experiment EFF successfully against the FBI before to court: accordingly Google also in future with no point of the constitution can be forced to handing over information to the FBI onto secret question. </seg>
<seg id="15"> (However the federal government obtained successfully the delivery of 50.000 website addresses and 1.000 search keys under reference to the protection of minors law passed before years ago, however, the list of individual users, and/or their weaving and search key list onto two months was withheld from her retroactively.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Googles image remains therefore controversial: Those who hand over their personal data reluctantly because they fear the loss their private and right to privacy through the use of the Google - services castigate the enterprise with the indignation being deserved by the companies representing themselves conservatively. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Meanwhile sees the American "Geek culture", which is present in many countries and inspired computer fans, activists and users eint, the next generation this "cool entrepreneur" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows Marktführer even if both fight for the same goal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> A possible reason for that is that Google does not demand any identification codes from his users unlike Microsoft, and provides its services freely so that an open, continuously updated source code and Programm-Package to seem to be far more attractive, more youthful and cooler, as the official practices of the software giant. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the other hand to look through the Geeks the problematic relationship of individual rights and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship, that in particular in the last years thanks to that Begriff "Web 2. 0" in the heart has moved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> at the "Web 2. 0" gone it indeed around nothing other, than around collaboration, speak, the user leave behind traces on purpose and use available channels of communication the, and even if proportions the are individually different, main thing remains the same one, to show oneself in public indeed. </seg>
<seg id="21"> An average of young people can manage be profile simultaneous on several community portals - of Facebook above Xanga, can these by means of other services, as about Twitter, or music services as last.fm can join with each other, and finally FriendFeed or Blip.fm bind this into a Nachverfolgungssystem all as about. In addition they can lead Blogs which represent the newest photographic galleries to be on Flickr or Picasa geostet automatically. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> And a number other exemplary cases proves: While considering the party photographs of last night the girlfriend finds out soon with whom their unfaithful friend enjoyed himself, or the staff is released because it does air to his on the management only far too honestly in his Blog - one is secure: The Begriff "privacy" became in the meantime entirely again interpreted. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Who leads an online life is what it gives away from itself - so in for instance one could formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And who attempts to keep something a secret, or to avoid quite the Google monopoly, can do that with pleasure - as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses the search engine Google, however, on purpose any traces does not leave behind. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Not a very few people do not register on purpose also the applications for online of Google on community pages so that they are not discoverable, however, as about Text Processing - and graphic Tools and RSS-Feeds, make deal with alternative versions that are not tied to any gigantic server parks and therefore either do not generate the best possible profile from the user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Meanwhile Public opinion waits for that excommunicatedly until Google shows its true face. </seg>
<seg id="27"> With its current value of $156 there is even the company for Mrd. IBM (USD 140 Mrd.), Intel (USD 124 Mrd.) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 Mrd.), the advertising spaces of AdWords / AdSense threaten the income of the advertisers, and that increasingly faster introduced services prepare is not only Microsoft, but also other software developers head fragmentation. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Critical observer might find, however, also the worrying counterpoles: So the directors entirely rejected about a protest of the staff after the charges the company ’ s kindergarten were doubled, in addition the management thought the frequent meals of the staff is too expensive. That all seems, however, almost mildly against Google going even into the knees in 2006 before the Chinese government and being agreed on an agreement according to which all regime - crucial hits, or those which offend against the good taste would be extracted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The internal settlement of the group says, that in advance no new service is applied, but only if this is already available. Nevertheless the events of the next few months and years could turn up again some strongly: While some are meaning, Googles Book - and to Magazinscan- and/or filing project accepts in the meantime scales, that the company would have to deal soon with the Uppermost Court of Justice, other are rather like this because of the Systems "Health" beunruhigt, that facilitates the preparation of a complete health section by means of findings, doctors and problems. </seg>
<seg id="30"> And the fact that Google establishes a genetic data base provides the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors with have the substance - approximately "Scroogled", the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes in best orwellschen manner a future, in which a human being thanks to data gotten by Google becomes frightening near - bar. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Intelligent car copies the flight of the Hummel </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> what the best method for the evolution of new technologies for the accident avoidance would be, when not to copy the obstacle sensors from the nature? </seg>
<seg id="3"> For example the one of the bees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the CEATEC in Japan a startling project was presented, at which the Nissan engineers of bumblebees during the creation were inspired new accident of avoiding systems. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In cooperation with the Tokyo University Nissan built the biomimetic system of the model BR23C controlled by car robots, a mini-car, endowed with the qualities of bees with the aim, to support the evolution of a system that avoids any collisions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In in flight Each bee forms their own, oval "private field", that our own "shield" very similar is, Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for Technology PR and investigation evolution, during the exhibition said. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The eye of the Bee put together that can see into any direction and in a corner from more than 300 degrees plays in this case an important role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In order to imitate the function of the eye put together the researchers picked up the idea of the optical maser - controlled telemeter. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a field of sight of 180 degrees within two metres, calculates their long distances and sends signals onto the microprocessor at board that immediately initiates the collision - avoiding process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The barrier is registered in fractions of a second, and the robot car changes immediately the course, similar to the movement of the bees, when he turns the tyres around the relevant corner. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unlike previous systems this ploy occurs in that instinctively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "If it was not like this, can the robot car not fast enough" Toshiyuki Andoh, conductor of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the selfrobot project, declared "to react in order to evade the obstacles". </seg>
<seg id="13"> The system must react instinctively and immediately since this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the protecting US from recession - a shift, to currently still be regarded as unavoidable within the accidents. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees if they avoid other bees. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And that must end in a split second. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, the evasiveness can not occur, unlike the bees, up, down, or at all diagonally - it can be only two - dimensional, and indeed only in the direction the Wendbarkeit of tyres. </seg>
<seg id="17"> To stand during the bees here infinitely many possibilities openly in order to avoid other bees could help the researchers at the robot car of only the rotary motion, and/or the speeding up and slowing-down's. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BR23C contains polymer lithium batteries which are lighter and more vigor - efficient, and therefore have a longer life, as traditional lithium ion batteries. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Andoh declared it depends on that the instinctive intelligent response and little onto the processing of the data, and still less onto the ability to store these. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> This device must process only a few inputs per second and react to them correspondingly. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It does not have to store these, or must produce by means of previous manoeuvres so that it uses constantly only a handful KB Memory. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It gigabyte and megabyte - heavy Memories does not need any. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is the first step in the evolution of the immediate conflict prevention technology which will be serial according to appraisal of Nissan within the next ten years in production. </seg>

<seg id="3"> In the first round half the money is supposed to be distributed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In a session, that on Saturday after midnight local time east coast zu Ende ging, struggled themselves the congress representatives after more - daily debates for an agreement about that 700 - billion dollar heavy rescue parcel, reported Reuters. </seg>
<seg id="5"> "we significant progress have achieve", Nancy Pelosi, democratic president said in the American Chamber of Deputies, and meant one must only still bring the agreement to paper. </seg>
<seg id="6"> both presidential candidates supported the achieved compromise about the rescue package - Barack Obama and John McCain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Minister of Finance Henry Paulson thought to the result: the programme will show effect and it becomes efficient, one must do, however, still more. According to Pelosi of Wall Street would not go it here around the rescue, but around pulling the helm of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The written composure of the package still became before the of the Asian markets, therefore, Washington time on on sunday night 8 at (Central European time Monday 2 a.m. in the morning), publishes, did not activate, however, any flight of fancy on the stock markets. </seg>

<seg id="11"> We are satisfied with the progress achieved in the night and value the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House, said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> the programme differs, however, from the initial recommendation of the Bush administration according to which the 700 billion dollars should be spent at the same time for the purchase of bonds rotten, burdened with loans. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a first tranche maximally half of the 700 - billion - amount with which 250 billion are immediately available is supposed to be distributed after as expected the congress will vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is supposed to be spent for the purchase of credit - loaded, bad bonds, and the president is supposed to decide on the further 100 billion USD. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The programme is checked by an own commission to which also the president of the Federal Reserve belongs. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The other half of the 700 depends on a further decision of the Congress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the sense of the law the Treasury can use also a combined tactics: Can buy same time bad loans, mortgages, and bonds burdened with mortgages, or also other "poisonous" credits. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Told as competent persons of the ministry the purchase can both in an auction, than also directly occur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The law makes to participate in an insurance programme with which the Treasury guarantees the worrying resources, and the companies pay the Exchequer charges corresponding to the damages to be expected for the affected companies possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so, that up to 700 billion dollars can be provided as emergency aid for the American financial system is for the large-scale purchase of bad means, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk which is activated by the collapse of a bigger bank. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We set Paulson the necessary steps so that we are ready for the introduction of the law as soon as it was signed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The chiefs of the banks in trouble guessed and now dependent onto government aid can reckon, however, that their dispatches which are mentioned "Golden Handshake" in the overseas - slang salopp are shortened by the government. </seg>
<seg id="22"> There will be A cut of salaries only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury helps out in each case. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The reduction in means basically, that if the department buys within the framework of an auction, so this "Golden Handshake" besteuert becomes, unless, that serve bank leader is removed into the pension. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In the case of a direct purchasing the bad loans the government will join in aggressively in order to guarantee that the directors ’ pay are not exaggerated. </seg>
<seg id="25"> To the picture appertains also, that the existing Golden Handshake-Verträge are changed not - the restrictions refer only to new agreements, in this way all the more people participate in the programme. </seg>
<seg id="26"> That is the first case in American history, the democrat Barney Frank, chairperson of the Financial Committee the measure, commented on cuts being controlled with manager - salaries by law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> The state gains participation rights at the participating banks so that the risk sinks for the taxpayers since they can also be involved as soon as it the economy and in this way also the saved bank again better goes. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The draft law plans that the president must make a proposition how the taxpayers' are supposed to get back their lost money from the financial sector again to the congress in the next five years. </seg>

<seg id="30"> That is not what the American people expect of us, the plan does not protect the money of the taxpayers under any circumstances, according to the Californian republican Darrell Issa. </seg>

<seg id="8"> Five years ago - added, under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber standing at his career peak - the Christian Social Union reached another 60,7 percent. Now, however, a year after the coup against Stoiber they could safeguard only 43,4 percent of the vote. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="9"> The CSU was 46 years long "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria, which erwirtschaftet 18 per cent of the German GDP. </seg>

<seg id="17"> if the CSU which contributed to the success a lot in 2005 also on national level should not be put on its feet with a common effort again, Merkel can not become chancellor again after the election of the Bundestag in September 2009. </seg>

<seg id="18"> The biggest rift consists in the American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them. </seg>
<seg id="19"> 56% of their editors-in-chief on national level are secure, their reporters share their values with them while it is being only 23% on local level. </seg>

<seg id="24"> Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. </seg>
<seg id="25"> To offer in a vast nation as it is the United States with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, broadcast and TV senders and internet operators the employers as they like it and a question of take it or leave it becomes like this it. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The elite is in danger </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The phenomenon as the chamber of deputies against which in 700 billion - dollar saving - parcel of the White House voted had already few days ago manifested itself: One large part of the Americans was and more is at that interested Wall Street to punish as the economy to save. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms the edition of the New York Times that reports about that, divided as the crisis in the run the republican party that divides itself up in their old and moderate East cobough soul more and more, of yesterday that always favored the state institutions and the business community and that neoconservative, that "those in Washington" and the of world finance hostile faces and before a. in the South and the centre of the states electorate wins. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This part of the party owes his rise before a. the voice of that, that I above-mentioned. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Meanwhile this just mentioned example is only a small part of the great modifications which the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, also in the whole West and maybe will be also beyond these concerned by these. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Both in the states and in Europe the crisis seems to speed up the long feared events which accept take shape under these new conditions at last and come onto to light. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard Renaissance of the state, in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In Fact the crisis means a decline of the banking and financial institutions, which close links to the outside have and at the same time an enormous amount of assets from private households that lives in a single state manage. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This means a direct political problem for the governments: indeed as it is to behave opposite the affected families necessary, which yes also one enormous electoral measures represent. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The crisis appears therefore economically global, political on the other hand it is almost in that national. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The political internationalism seems so to have gotten into marginalised in and to have lost be allowed at itself: The obvious evidence for that was given by the EU, not to find which one due to their division in various national and international conflicts a common way white. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Therefore calculate now all with the intervention of their own state; Rescue plans, new rules, and before a. distribution of aid fund: Since the crisis became increasingly more serious only the United States are in the economic situation to escape without foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And next to the resources they in addition have also the legitimacy these use: thus two conditions not too überwertende - under certain circumstances -, onto which ones else is not an international organisation and not a market in a similar way will be able to go back. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> That new emphasis which is put onto the public - national element is by the way in perfect unison with the increasingly greater importance which recently is brought in the economy with a sector allied onto the narrowest in touch: to The territoriality. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Paradoxical way is to just have joined a cross-linked entire empire it now when we were nevertheless so convinced by that for a long time, into an empire of the always refined technologies, the immaterial one, that we must find out at the same time how nevertheless our future will depend on the things in an essential way physical more and more: </seg>
<seg id="16"> Water, harvest and oil. These can be transported to the other one of the world certain indeed all of a place, nevertheless are awake, however, utmost united with a closely paraphrased piece of earth - a territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Therefore that one that has a such territory is to another that lives in a field harvest - free, water - free or free from oil reserves opposite to advantage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I come now to the second innovation to presuppose, however a brief insertion. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Who territory, who government, who says policy, says too leadership in this way. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the one hand the knowledge is white to that one there around the necessity of Leaderships looked at, that is the demand for somebody, as one controls the things. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On the Other Hand now a wave of the indignation about the existing leadership exists, before a. those of the economics that turned out as inadequately and fully blind sectors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Finally in addition a deep aspect sufficing and worrying in some ways still comes: A confidence loss, an Unduldsamkeit, a picture of the whilst, a feeling of the distance which is directed itself towards a whole class all from managers of the western countries. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Seems to clear like this the conviction under large parts of the population the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content the majority than always other and überkommener represent. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The demand for Leadership nourishes in a therefore underground way a branched but powerful movement of the Entmachtung of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in sudden "Revolts" this voters and in the unprovided change of the collective state of mind of the last time: beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the breakdown of the Labour Party in Britain, there for the rebellion of the American members against George Bush (and maybe also the victory plays the rights in Italy here a role). </seg>
<seg id="26"> One gains the impression as if the old elite has their parties their programmes, but also their Riten, journals, intellectual creditors, to some would become say to her format, more and more sense problems and therefore less representative value concerning what nowadays goes before itself in the lower social classes of the West and still amplifies from the financial crisis and is driven up to the Überdimensionalität. </seg>
<seg id="27"> in the face of all of this would be it in a simple way exaggerated, of one "rebel ion the Massen" to speak. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Holding the eyes far openly, however, is not meanwhile surely. </seg>

<seg id="1"> On reunions to the old movie theater Paradiso - the towns lock their historic cinemas </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The historical movie theaters close due to the favored multichannel movie theaters. </seg>
<seg id="3"> "one city without cinemas is a blind city, as a face without eyes. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore currently describes something with effect in the large urban centres Italy, and also in the provinces, happens. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The process of the exclusion of the movie theaters which began with the birth of the big multihall complexes in the periphery means in the long term the death for the one eel cinema in the center. A process which does not appear only unabwendbar and irrevocably, but supports also the trains of a cultural crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Mostly historical places of full memories are affected ", to lose as a friend" it is, with which one a piece streets of full of emotion put back plan ", so the director of the film" Nuovo Cinema Paradiso ", which brought in the Oscar and the big prize from Cannes for him 20 years ago. It is a question of the history of a Vorstadtkinos and his nostalgia which consists of living in a presumably forever lost movie theater world. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The figures, which the particular, the central trade association delivers, speak one clearly language: in the past five years the enormous amount of 316 of traditional movie theater had to close; the cinemas paid this bill to for the most part of in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 into Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> To the most strongly affected areas belong Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost movie theaters, followed from the Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This shows the main culprits being the multichannel movie theaters, because it is just these three areas in which the greatest number of these modern movie theaters was registered: with 195 in the last five years the Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are it both in Tuscany and in the Emilia-Romagna. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "this business has in an irrational manner develop", so Paolo Protti, the president of the particular ", it is useful indeed, that new structures turn out, nevertheless at first place the receipt of the already existing one stands, because a hall closes in the city, all his regular customers are not ready to consult a multichannel cinema instead of the old one in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And here still the lack of budget remains for the ground of the trade association of äusser care: the burden of debt noted by the state is approx. 10 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a disgrace from an ethical position that the government does not pay attention to the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In order to receive the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be per in the year of needs ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The case of Bologne, the first Italian city to decide due to of about the old cinemas on protecting these through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec, is interesting; it is a question of that to protect first descendants of this kind in Italy, which aims at that, the traditional movie theaters and to support, and this both in the historic centre, than also in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Under the foreseen measures also tax Bevorteilungen are for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the audience concerning the local traffic's: it will be allowed to go into the traffic - limited fields of the centre and in addition to park to more favorable parking fees. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "it a pleasant Initiative is", so Giuseppe Tornatore ", I hopes, that other cities will follow our example and in addition also still project new concepts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Certainly, however, we need also a better audio and video equipment in order to be able to achieve something against the superpower of the multichannel halls, because finally the public is from today more pretentious. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The defense of the traditional movie theater was always an important issue for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that brought me for this purpose this "Nuovo cinema Paradiso" to found, even if I had played with the idea already since 10 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Since 25 years I live in Rome; when I pass by at the Rialto or at the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I experienced so many different emotions, I turn myself to on the side in order not to have to see the dust - overcast posters. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The accusations of the disbarment of the anti-Mafia - authority of Kalabriens against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality Gioia Tauro that this morning was arrested because of involvement in mafia activities are fatal. </seg>

There are places in which the concentration is greater to of the Mafia than in other ones in which such links are virtually inevitable. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> The arrests of this morning follow those of the last July with which according to the police the clan Piromalli was beheaded. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since the end of the last April the town council had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro, nevertheless already 1991 - and also then due to alleged combinations between organized crime and the local administration - the local politicians their town councils had been relieved. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="14"> From a listening - action in connection with the investigations for the case Dal Torrione, the willingness to comply with the wishes of an entrepreneur that a representative is to the large group as is generally known around the Piromalli was proved - through which the measures of public administration became identical with the interests of this clans.

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is a not versiegende money source, which one above 70% of the surface of the planet covers and the big energy companies of the world do not seem this before now understand. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable sources of energy onto those ones now all look, and also to occupy seek, such giants as Chevron. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The possibility to gain vigor from the movements of the sea is already since 70 years taken into account and examined; not by chance these studies were intensified since the first oil crisis considerably. </seg>
<seg id="5"> When the price of to in 1980 started around 1980 vergas one the idea of the energy from the sea now, however, environmental organisations and the climbed the price of oil would insist on new impulses in this sector. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The World Energy Council (WEC) in London reckons that 15% of the Worldwide energy demand of the vigor produced through the ocean waves could be covered. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This would amount to the double one of the vigor currently produced through nuclear power stations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition the currents and tidal would in addition still come. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Giants in the attack. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The first company to put on the energy from the sea now is Enersis who signed a contract for the establishment of a power plant in 2005 in northern Portugal. </seg>
<seg id="11"> When This news was published it seemed to act around a revolutionary step. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is two years later now more and more to firms from the traditional energy policy that put on the marine energy production. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Chevron examines these technologies" - so the speaker of an enterprise, known to the American Giants, in the Wall Street Journal - and the possibility to cooperate with us considers. " </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is a question at that of to obtain a listing from the American energy commission which is necessary in order to start a project before the coast Alaskas. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This is a sign not to be underestimated, before a. if one considers that just in Alaska oil keeps on being won through the United States and president Bush got first the plans going recently for new borings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Next to chevron also the companies are Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey that invest in the new industry; nevertheless, if the details are not known, observers speak so of an increasing interest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Still improvement - worthy technologies. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Experts speak of a technology being still in the departure, this last but not least, since the last doubts are not yet clarified on the part of the environmentalists. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Up to now projects such as the one are in Portugal and also Scotland rather small dimension and no ecological problems to be taken seriously to cause shine. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In order to produce vigor, however, in a large scale, it needs technologies with far greater influence on the environment. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There are several possibilities: Ocean Power about is useful a system of buoys joined with each other. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The shear of the waves that moves the buoys up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmers about plungers and magically. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This drives a turbine which practices in turn a generator. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The electricity is sent on that about run-off water management to the coast. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Until now there is four planned plant this kind that only still waits for the state approval. A part of the gained vigor could serve also for military facilities. </seg>

<seg id="26"> Meanwhile Verdant Power produces already energy for a product department store and a flap park with the aid of submarine turbines in the East River from New York. </seg>

<seg id="31"> Nevertheless, although it is a question also of an irregular phenomenon the tidal are better predictable as wind currents, the sun and the waves, and therefore a trustworthier power source. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Just the tidal power it is, which Federal state as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states brought to investing dollars in the year 2008 in the year 2008 - for 2009 are already up to 35 million planned. </seg>
