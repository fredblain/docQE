<p>
<seg id="2"> We advise you in your election </seg>
<seg id="3"> While nearly every mobile phone MP3-Dateien, moreover, may not yet telephone MP3 player. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Therefore it is, of course, is that it is better to buy a phone only. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Despite this, there is plenty of reasons why we should get a stand-alone player. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The election is of the type of use and the demands of the future owner. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Certainly we buy it at home for a splendid expensive Plattenspieler to put out the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc to hear. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Even such musical new features to appear not LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Have you LPs, however, with the kind of rock, jazz or Blues in the shelf, it is likely that you dream of at least one of them. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It is also with the music on travel, with condensed music - music in a simple MP3-Format. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Here, too, there are price and quality categories. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For a perhaps it is not acceptable for a player to spend eight thousand kronor, but also to a Pink-Floyd-Fan headphones for twenty kronor from the market. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Two extremes, between which it enough room for everyone. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The selection is widespread. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The life of the batteries is crucial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Some good music player for much more than just music, moreover, but what mobile phones, they do not even create an indication. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No modern equipment are as universal as the telephone. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition to the primary functions, the phone calls and the Simsen, may reflect music and videos, both, it has a better, sometimes a worse photo apparatus and can also perhaps way. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And if you still the Smartphons and Kommunikatoren, it was almost a small computer in the bag. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a small miracle, because no fridge can souvenir Grillen and no television. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more often you will, however, need to shop. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And the playing of music is one of the largest Energiefresser. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Only a few mobile phones can music for longer than 10 12 hours are commonplace, mostly it is much less. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In this respect, are Music player (especially the simplest) much more efficient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> This is why you must count on the cheap mobile phones so that they do not longer than a few hours of music are commonplace. </seg>
<seg id="27"> If you then to telephone and yet, you prefer to buy the safety a loading gear for office - and this applies to more expensive equipment. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In MP3 players, you may not have this problem, even the less good consider at least 9 hours of operation with a time of loading. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Another problem is, if it is the music on the mobile phone überspielen wants. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Unfortunately, only a small part of the equipment on a USB-Abschluss, is also not every mobile phone without specific software directly to a PC. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Of course, the music can be directly to a storage medium überspielen, but only a few cards reading equipment will be without reduction with the tiny memory cards, which are used in mobile phones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> In the players need you to exceptions (iPod) no special software. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They need only on the machine USB-Port with music from your PC to feed. </seg>
<seg id="34"> The majority of mobile phones and even player a music library, in an orderly fashion after the name of the performers, the title of the Albums, the genre or, for example, the assessment by users. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Some devices are only the tree structure of the Adressverzeichnisses, similar to the Windows Explorer, certain people are both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Players are easier to operate, more mobile phones can </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In the selection of a specific piece of equipment you should, especially after the lifespan of Akkus, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of Klangs and, of course, the Bedienkomfort back. </seg>
<seg id="38"> You have music scene in particular and hear it every day, for example, only briefly in the trams, then enough any mobile phone to MP3-Dateien developments. </seg>
<seg id="39"> What really can almost every mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="40"> They must not even particularly control what music formats, a mobile phone or a player can process. </seg>
<seg id="41"> MP3 all create, and most of the music that you get, will be particularly in this format. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The format is one of the most widespread, and most of the equipment also music WMA-Format shrouded in. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Less customary is AAC (a format that Apple and its i-pods use). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Better mobile phones also allow the purchase of music online. </seg>
<seg id="45"> We need only on the side of a mobile Internet Providers (or of another supplier to call), and you can buy a song or album. </seg>
<seg id="46"> This is a service that is already in itself be a sufficiently convincing argument for why we should get a music phone. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Unfortunately, the offer of the provider is bad, and usually only limited on rapid Radiohits. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The prices are not the lowest. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Generally expected but that it is just this sort of selling music (be it on GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) in future, the music industry will dominate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> The mobile phone bear the most. </seg>
<seg id="51"> If you have the inclination, to listen to something, you after the mobile phone in the with them, while the player at home is forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="52"> It is, however, whether you always, or at least a wireless headphones Freisprecheinrichtung in themselves. </seg>
<seg id="53"> If not, you can rely on the integrated loudspeakers, on almost every mobile phone, but only the least MP3 player. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Probably the greatest benefit of the music mobile phones for many in the price. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Usually the cheapest cost less than three thousand kronor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> For three and four thousand kronor will get you a very decent Walkman. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The biggest handicap for the majority will be that no normal headphones. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The best and most technically advanced phones with a 3,5-mm-Öffnung for normal headphones cost of up to fifteen thousand kronor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The advantage of the player is the light. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really each service. </seg>
<seg id="61"> A minimum of functions, the similarity in the restaurant with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or, for example, the Plattenspieler is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="62"> There is no collision in the form of a mistaken salaried mobile Internet and then a horrendous bill for data transfers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> The equipment should now be resort </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64"> The cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) are generally a slot for exchange at storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.). </seg>

<seg id="66"> But respect. </seg>
<seg id="67"> In the basic models are usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB supported. </seg>
<seg id="68"> 8-GB-Speicherkarten only the most expensive can also read. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The first virtual providers are already in this year after the Czech Republic. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Perhaps it </seg>
<seg id="3"> The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite fully developed, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they also by its partners in Western Europe are offered. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless, is missing something here - a virtual providers, the conventional forces to lower prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Perhaps this is not be long in coming. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Czech mobile telephone providers to the most expensive in Europe in the first place to work, as we have often on Mobil.cz reported. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, the attention made that the price of a text message here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. </seg>
<seg id="8"> After the last steps of the European Commission in terms of regulation of roaming charges is as likely to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone operators will be cheaper SMS from abroad than at home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> So how is it that the prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe so high? </seg>
<seg id="10"> The answer is simple, there is no competition, which really a challenge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic, but there are three mobile networks and a Penetration of far more than 100%. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The mobile phone operators to go against the fact that it in the Czech market is very much competition. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The does often also the chairman of the Council of the Czech telecommunications authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, which in the past has often said that no place in the Czech Republic for another supplier. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is likely that a classic providers with their own network no longer has very many opportunities (incidentally, he probably would hardly any frequencies. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But there is still a possibility - a virtual providers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> It is precisely the entry of virtual providers in the mobile market expressed a clear price reduction, on the traditional mobile phone operators had to respond. </seg>
<seg id="17"> But was it before the entry of such firms such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain similar votes as in the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But it has shown that there is room for such providers and that this really can succeed. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Incidentally, you need not long after examples to seek. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In February of this we have on the launch of the virtual provider mobile King reported in Poland. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In just half a year, this providers, more than 100 thousand customers to win and so on the five biggest supplier of the country standing. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Behind mobile King is the financial group Penta, in the Czech Republic, among other things, U: Fon has. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The advantage of virtual providers is that it on a much more specific target group can focus. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In order to be able to be efficient, virtual providers need much less customers as a classic providers. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They need not a relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the world as the virtual providers themselves as normally Low-Cost-Firmen - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, however, often by a less extensive service. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> So, for example, offers Tesco in the UK Mobile SMS by at least half cheaper than its competitors. </seg>
<seg id="28"> However, as the example of mobile King in Poland shows that it can also be a very good move on a not klischeehafte target group. </seg>
<seg id="29"> This providers is specifically aimed at men. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "Real Kerle choose mobile King - the provider, they like it and they can trust," David Seibert, the chief executive of the Mobile entertainment Company, the company of this virtual provider. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It's hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland and in the Czech Republic could take root. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Doubt the press secretary of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is for a segment of the market, in the most virtual providers are based, relatively small. </seg>
<seg id="33"> He is also from the point of view of the services offer relatively saturated. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In the Czech Republic chancenlos, my mobile phone providers </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile phone operators segment of the Czech Republic, this does not mobile King will be. </seg>
<seg id="36"> "We talk about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations are not particularly hope. </seg>
<seg id="37"> It is rather to a market of mobile King in other countries are our region, "says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press spokesman for the financial group Penta. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Indirectly, confirmed it so that the current mobile phone providers in the Czech Republic that ideas are not particularly favor. </seg>
<seg id="39"> On the contrary, they are trying to ensure that not a potential competitor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Their interest in a launch of a virtual mobile provider for some time already shows the group GTS Novera who wish to take a further step, a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of wholesale to be. </seg>
<seg id="41"> "We have a great interest in our customers do not only fixed, but also Mobilfunk-Telekommunikationsdienstleistungen offer. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And the sooner, the better. </seg>
<seg id="43"> This is the opportunity we have repeatedly with all the Czech mobile providers negotiated. </seg>
<seg id="44"> With some of them already, we were able to achieve progress in negotiations, "the press spokesman for the group Kaidl Pavel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Perhaps now come better times. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Is not official information reveals that the first virtual providers perhaps to be expected by the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="47"> So far, but this is of an insurmountable wall of silence surrounded. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "At the moment we are not assuming that in the Czech Republic for a full virtual providers. </seg>
<seg id="49"> The Czech market compared to other markets has great specifics on. </seg>
<seg id="50"> So far, we still has no subject with a complex and serious project in this area mentioned ", says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> On the specific nature of the Czech market point further providers. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The press by German operator T-Mobile presenting its spokeswoman Martina Kemrová bows in rare agreement with the statement by O2 added: "So far, we have not yet a viable and mutually albeit found on which one could build on." </seg>
<seg id="53"> And it added: "In the network of German operator T-Mobile presenting its by the end of the year is hardly a virtual providers. </seg>
<seg id="54"> In this moment we should already have a concrete offer, in order to be able to think in the short term. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Vodafone direct its attention more to meet the requirements of the own 3G-Lizenz. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers are we open, particularly in the field of division of costs and infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="57"> We look at it from the point of view of the customers as the best. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in search of a partner to build a shared network for a quick mobile Internet. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The actions of the mobile telephone providers is easy to understand another providers would be more competition, that would lead to a fall in prices and also lead to a decline in profits. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Why, then, should be such a competitors from entering the market facilitate? </seg>
<seg id="62"> That the providers can pull together, if something is also fined the long commuting the emergence of U: Fon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Probably the strongest pressure in the direction ČTÚ was at time when U: Fon came on the market, of the German operator T-Mobile presenting its society. </seg>
<seg id="64"> The show also the publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ-Webseiten. </seg>
<seg id="65"> But now is precisely U: Fon as a reason why we should not allow a virtual providers. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Martina Kemrová said: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently been entering the market and a fourth mobile provider strengthened. </seg>
<seg id="67"> In light of the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is clear that a new player in the market itself and, above all, his services high standards. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> In view of this approach of the mobile phone operators, however, surprised the absolute indifference of the Czech regulatory authorities. </seg>
<seg id="69"> It is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ in Czech, unlike Britain and other developed countries - not the competence has, to intervene in the economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="70"> This is exclusively the office for the protection of economic competition (ÚOHS). </seg>
<seg id="71"> This but was this whole problem to his very typical attitude. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> "The market of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after it to a contract between a mobile phone providers and a virtual providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="73"> So far, no such contract was concluded, because the supply of potential stakeholders for the traditional operators was probably not enough interesting, "in his response to our question Kristián Chalupa by the department of external relations ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> By representatives of the providers would not be surprising. </seg>
<seg id="75"> By one authority, the consumer interests represented and, among other things, to ensure that no one misused his position in the market, this is more a matter of concern. </seg>
<seg id="76"> Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual providers work quite normal, is entering the market at a price reduction in mobile telephone services has helped." </seg>
<seg id="77"> But are probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and not a price cut to the interests of the ÚOHS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> It is truly shocking in this case, the almost touching line of the three mobile phone providers, from their reactions. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The question of whether it really is just a coincidence, is obvious. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Just as the absolutely same petrol price of petrol stations certainly only coincidence, the consequence of the tough competition. </seg>
<seg id="81"> "The authority has no evidence discovered in this matter, at a point against the competition act along, and therefore has no reason in some way to intervene in the matter. </seg>
<seg id="82"> None of the supplier has a dominant market position, so he has not the appropriate increased responsibility for his actions in the market. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The necessary instruments for the opening of the mobile phone market for virtual providers also probably lack the regulatory authority for telecommunications, led Chalupa in his statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points. </seg>
<seg id="85"> There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drafted by the ČTÚ, after the telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market. </seg>
<seg id="86"> In such a market has, of course, none of the Czech mobile telephone providers a dominant position. </seg>
<seg id="87"> But some legal experts have a different point of view, for access to the market of a virtual provider is always the approval of the network operator. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And the mobile phone providers - logically has - for its network the monopoly. </seg>
<seg id="89"> The means that he, in a certain segment necessarily a dominant position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90"> Even if we were not able but with this argument, it for the ÚOHS should at least be a warning that three mobile phone operators are remarkably similar. </seg>
<seg id="91"> This show complaints of a number of interested parties (including the above society GTS Novera) that it in negotiations with all providers in very similar difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="92"> Buck-passing ČTÚ is on the in the telecommunications services quite a common ploy, with the ÚOHS of the whole matter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> This was so in a number of similar cases. </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately it is possible in the recent revision of the telecommunications law passed the enlargement of the powers of the ČTÚ on the field of economic competition in the telecommunications, although a number of experts from promised an improvement of the situation. </seg>
<seg id="95"> This is the representatives of the ÚOHS know only too well, but they probably have other interests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="96"> It is, if no one watching </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> First unappreciated remains the functioning of any pseudovirtueller providers, which in the Czech mobile networks several. </seg>
<seg id="98"> There are firms that own price lists for mobile telecommunications services are spending, but only partly open to the public. </seg>
<seg id="99"> It is normally by firms in the area Multilevel-Marketing act. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Their own mobile telephone services offer Amway, for example, Bohemia Telecom, Star life and others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="101"> The price lists of these firms usually only selected to come. </seg>
<seg id="102"> The joke of the matter is that the firm to the operators as a classical firms customer occurs, of a large amount of SIM cards. </seg>
<seg id="103"> As an important client receives he then specific price offers (and other offers). </seg>
<seg id="104"> The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone providers a similar resale ban. </seg>
<seg id="105"> "Should there be cases that you describe, then it is a violation of the contractual conditions, which we are working, which brought an end to cooperation with the relevant society can bring," said Martina Kemrová to our question on this problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> However, it is unlikely that something in the leaders of the mobile phone operators gets around not. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Particularly in the case of the three listed firms can it be thousands of customers. </seg>
<seg id="108"> No operator, however, opposes such a move. </seg>
<seg id="109"> From the activity of these companies that they are not negligible gains, at the same time, be it - unlike the real virtual suppliers - not by the real official marketing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="110"> To possible problems Miroslav Čepický: "The law allows these types of speculation, despite all the services of these firms, only a very small percentage of customers used. </seg>
<seg id="111"> This must also accept that the SIM-Karte in their telephone not on their behalf, so they may not have fully about how the normal customer of the mobile phone providers. " </seg>
<seg id="112"> That alone but should the ČTÚ at least strange deposits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="113"> It also opens up a further question for the ÚOHS. </seg>
<seg id="114"> Close the mobile telephone providers from such an approach, why they are against a virtual providers? </seg>
<seg id="115"> It is to add that the ÚOHS to uncover such activities have very strong powers, and if it does not want to, it must not with the declaration of the providers, they knew nothing and their business conditions would this ban, satisfied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="116"> When the Czech Republic is not the most expensive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117"> As the text has already been pointed out on several occasions, the market brought a sharp price drop virtual providers in the various services. </seg>
<seg id="118"> Bearing in virtually all countries, where virtual providers are created, the traditional providers tried to the emergence of practically more or less to prevent. </seg>
<seg id="119"> The arguments used by them were virtually identical - is too small, or too much gesättigter market, problems with the quality of the services, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> In the advanced countries but just stepped in these times, the regulatory bodies, the far from the interests of the mobile telephone providers, but tried to maintain their customers. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Is it by formal or informal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operators, and this was followed by further. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies raise to the whole case like a hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="123"> On the basis of our experience, we can not get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competence in these cases is more than favourable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> But we do not throw the Flinte. </seg>
<seg id="125"> If the background information is correct and soon a virtual providers emerge, the Czech mobile market may soon to move again. </seg>
<seg id="126"> If a supplier to the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, is allowing the ÚOHS will remain inactive when it comes to reject (to discriminate against other interested parties). </seg>
<seg id="127"> And finally, the Czechs are no longer telephone more expensive than the rest of Europe. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In big words lack in the letter of the WestLB-Vorstands to the staff of the House. </seg>
<seg id="3"> By a coming together of the Institute Düsseldorfer money with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank "could the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe", it says in the letter on Monday reported. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The advertisers by WestLB, a "competence block" with sustainable profitability in such a business. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And could such a link of the decisive impetus to further Bündelungen banking sector in the country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> So reads it, if a board of ability to act in a difficult time to demonstrate. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The wounded by WestLB, still is under tremendous pressure. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for securities regulator, which the government nordrhein-westfälischen country recently has made it clear that the time is pushing, a future solution to be found. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Of a sort of link between the Deka-Bank, the savings bank customers for their investment funds are aware, and the by WestLB, however, is for some time - the speech at Frankfurt side. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Although it has Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas in the presentation of the half-yearly figures to the end of August, in a merger of the House to the Mainzer highway with a country bank Helaba or by WestLB, for example, see it would make no sense. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But has the Board of the Deka, the half from each of the country, banks and building societies were going associations, the Board mandated, with the by WestLB talks on joint business activities. </seg>
<seg id="12"> This could it that capital market business or parts of them go. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The talks are, however, as stated in the financial centre, has only just begun. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Of the Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 members of the more important employers at the City of Frankfurt, is not the first time the speech when it for consolidation in the sector is building societies. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2003, it looked for a moment as from, as if the Deka-Bank with the country bank Helaba Rhineland-Palatinate and merge. </seg>
<seg id="16"> From this tripartite federal was, however. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Hardly the plans were publicly become, said the government Hessische country against a participation of Helaba out from. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The other two houses were not next to each other. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The country Bank Rhineland-Palatinate instead went to the country Bank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But has it again on a combination of ideas Deka-Bank with land banks. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Recently, however, had Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, against plan games on a combination with his home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Regardless of the verdict but seems to mature that a together the various houses of the public sector is suffering. </seg>
<seg id="23"> After the Land election in Bavaria is over, could the first a combination of bank BayernLB with the country näherrücken Baden-Württemberg. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Should the pressure to further mergers rise, going to get the partner for it. </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the south would be they become junior partner, although so far the financial crisis has experienced far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. </seg>
<seg id="27"> A combination with the West LB, in turn, has the Sparkassen- Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen and, with 85 percent of the Helaba, is the beginning of the year, put a stop to it. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Would remain if anything, the North LB. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Such geostrategic considerations are but only one side. </seg>
<seg id="30"> On the other there is the question of how the different business models of the individual houses to each other. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In June expressed Merl, the key issue facing the business model is the future ability of the country to ensure banks should be by the Germans Sparkassen- Giroverband and so far not been answered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> In the end, could also be a cutting of the West LB, which, of course, there is not wanted. </seg>
<seg id="33"> So is in the letter of the local board of directors, the talk, it will in any case a "global solution" to the House. </seg>
<seg id="34"> As with the combination of individual units with the Deka-Bank together can bring, will still show. </seg>

<seg id="19"> But even if awareness not by language had depended, it certainly influence, animal awareness, as it may be, like, probably very of the majority of our Bewusstseins-zustände differences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> It is therefore difficult to measure how awareness in other animals may be. </seg>
<seg id="21"> If it is, and as something meeting Subjektives, either measure, because of the specific hardware, using our own experience can analyse, his research into major problems. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Most of my comments relate to the content of the deliberate Erlebens, but there is also another aspect of the awareness, the scientific might be more easily accessible. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It could be the awareness processes of animals without regard to investigate their content, and that is what is happening in studies on the short memory of primates, particularly in the case of the Visualisierung. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed up, we moved more on the neural Korrelate awareness than on the causal mechanism: They may or may not be identical. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal cortex, to reach the Visualisierung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> What is for the feelings? </seg>
<seg id="27"> I attribute it to the fact that an emotive system like the fear in one of his own activity conscious brain activated. </seg>
<seg id="28"> What we as a "fear", is the mental state in which we are, if the activity of the brain lokalisierten defense system (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) working memory. </seg>
<seg id="29"> As seen sentiments are closely tied to the regions of the cortex, the primates, and in particular the people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Associated with the linguistic natural result fine escalation of the sense of, because we, with the help of the words and grammar conditions can differentiate and categorise them alongside other due to ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> On the other hand, says Antonio Damasio that sentiments from more low � level of activity in the body and of the feeling areas of the cortex Hirnstammes emerge Jaak Pankseep similar, but increasingly focused on the brain stem. </seg>
<seg id="32"> As this network in the course of human evolution have not changed very, very definitely species could be included on feelings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> In theory, I could not, however, think it for unbeweisbar. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Pankseep argues that in rats and people like fear appear, probably also felt in both cases, as in: But how could you check whether rats and people feel the same, if they behave in the same way? </seg>
<seg id="35"> A Schabe at risk of flight, whether they also fear is? </seg>
<seg id="36"> In my view, can mere Verhaltensähnlichkeit equality show no experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> It helps the neurale comparison: Rats and people have similar brain tribes, not even a brain Schaben against. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But is the brain stem is responsible for feelings? </seg>
<seg id="39"> And even if we could prove the for the people: As we used to prove it in rats? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), feelings. </seg>
<seg id="41"> But I do not know how I should prove it. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And because their feelings probably differ radically from our own (as the human consciousness on specific Schaltkreisen and language is based), the emotional behaviour erforsche I rather than the emotional feelings of rats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> In any case, peddling progress here on the neural level, if we in rats and people the same measures. </seg>
<seg id="44"> As I language and sensitivity erforsche in rats, not sentiments, I do not know whether they exist. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It may be that for short-sighted, but I come forward rather than constantly to run up against a brick wall. </seg>
<seg id="46"> I am a practical Emotionalist. </seg>

<seg id="5"> It is 30 inch and 120 feet long and rather after a dusty alleyway and used for an active through road from. </seg>
<seg id="6"> There are also no road signs. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is virtually impossible to them on a Standard-Straßenplan to strike. </seg>
</p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In this edition of "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller, debate and lance T. Izumi the positions of the candidates for the bilingual education. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Lance T. Izumi, senior scientific staff in Kalifonischen studies and senior director in the specialist education sciences in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "is not as good as we think: Why is the middle class a Schulauswahl needs". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To the Hispanic voters is a complex task. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Barrack Obama's proposals on the subject of education are a case in point. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Obama's campaign said, the "the likelihood afro-amerikanischen and Hispanic students in the school concluded successfully, is lower than in white pupils' - which is true. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This achievement gap to close Obama's education plan recommends specifically from other a bilingual transition in the training for those who only learn English. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Nevertheless, there is the question for Obama is whether his commitment to the bilingual education, the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, his interest, the gap in the Schulleistungen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Take this as an example of "" preparatory conference "Sixth Street", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The majority of pupils are hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently in the country are, learn English. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Nevertheless, have amazing 100% in 2008 pupils of the fourth class the state math exam in on a good footing. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Also surprising was 93 per cent of children from the fourth school in the English test evaluated as well. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The astonishing success was achieved with other methods, as those who preferred by Obama. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The school Sixth Street will make its focus to review and exercise at constant monitoring of knowledge and an attitude that no exceptions tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In addition, the school is the approach that the training in an English-speaking environment. This is precisely the point that Obama should bear in mind, the Schulleiterin Linda Mikels. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This approach attaches importance to the almost ausschliesslichen use of the English language in the specialist teaching. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Madam Mikels, the idea of bilingual education rejects it, said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a student, who only came about from Mexico. 12 months later, the class room entering and it can no longer recognize. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "It will work," she said, "it works for us". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Would Obama a school as the "Sixth Street" preparatory conference "" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learning pupils? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The performance of the school would be the answer to this question easily, but the educational positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support of the bilingual education make predictions on Obama's answer uncertain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently the subject of trivialised by he said that people should stop concerned about the "only English" separatist legislation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Instead, he said: "They should ensure that your child is Spanish." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If Obama really wants to close the achievement gap, should he carefully consider education models, the work, rather than to despise and to trivialize. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia, has shown why him some of the best Langstreckenläufer of all time, after he in the Berlin marathon on Sunday has broken his own record and has become the first people, of the journey from 42,2 kilometres in less than 2 hours, 4 minutes has managed. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Last month Gebrselassie has left out of the Olympic marathon in Beijing, for fear that the hindsight was too much, that the air pollution his asthma problems could worsen. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Instead, it has registered for the race in Berlin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start, and 13 degrees Gebrselassie has - with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile won. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Since then, Bahnläufer as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya on long-haul have changed, is the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 with the result in Berlin 2: 06: 05 won. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> After his victory on Sunday Gebrselassie has told the press that he had two weeks ago in his Wade Krämpfe had a week and could therefore not train. </seg>

<seg id="15"> But this criticism is damaging the size Gebrselassies as Langstreckenläufer. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Hidden between the excesses of the leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glitzernden, noisy and gigantic activities, is a calm city in which the pride and the complications of the shadows afro-amerikanischen culture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the city Hurstons Zora Neale, is no longer so easy to describe it as Hurston in 1935 did: "The city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers do end up drinking it, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." </seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, it is a pilgrimage site. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Alice Walker, had Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee are for the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville come at the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance to memory. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> And yet is and remains the city that it describes – and it into a tourist excursion goal made by them in the Florida travel leaders began, to periods of depression by the German writer project has been produced in many ways a place of particular variety. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Eatonville is so independent, and private as sound overall in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities often refused in Florida, their true idea with the weissen man to share, "so little about us know that he does not know what escapes him." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Even today, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama to an open dialogue on race relations, there are still many here had to be monitored by Aussenseitern. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "We are very anxious as our story is told," Hortense Jones, 59, from birth, a resident of the town and community member of the oldest church in the city. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It must vote. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Eatonville was for a long time as a paradox of triumph and the fight defined. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is both an historic example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2.400 inhabitants, in the poverty rate is twice the national average. </seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand it is a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes convicted, sometimes touted - black culture of the rural South, its roots in the American slavery. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is not surprising that people here both proud and on the hat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And so it began the concerns about Eatonville's image with Zora, as everyone Hurston call. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It questioned the world their city, in books, which came from heart and in Mundart were written as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Five paragraphs in the Florida travel leaders modified the city, which is quite near the route 77, a street oft-vergessene centre by Florida leads to the scene of black history and human tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Smart as Oskar, both in real life and in the literature, led to the shop Hurston reader of Eatonvilles first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned privateren affairs. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "On the left side of the road," wrote it, "is the brown -weiss angestrichene modern school, with its leafy gardens and game seats, the always attended Howard Miller, although it hardly can read and write." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> They also mentioned the new man from widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "drinks of any kind was-auch-immer and sold to hours rooms suits." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In only a few hundred words Hurston Eatonville brought so with even government in connection, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This was certainly not a trip leader. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In fact, this was not a Portrait, which by all estimated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> "Zora described it as they were," the 90 year-old Dinkins Ella, one of the Johnson-Mädchen the Hurston verewigte by the men quoted, the songs on their beauty sang, the full of sexual innuendo. </seg>
<seg id="25"> She added: "Some people liked this not." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> We remember here Hurtson still as a lively Exzentrikerin, the regelmässig returned after their family after Jacksonville, Florida, was drawn. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Augustus Franklin, 77, reminded that if Hurston gebraust came in the city, they usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, rauchend and with trousers, which even today in a city with its venerable clothing style einbildet. </seg>
<seg id="28"> According to Mr Franklin were the majority of the inhabitants fascinated, whereas many of you despise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "The people were Zora always glad to see," said Mr Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But "she was never too long," he added while he was in his chair schaukelte, on a terrace backfired situated on the Sabelia sea to look to the Hurston in all likelihood was baptised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> As Hurston died in 1960 it was poor and their books produced enough. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Along with the majority of the world Eatonville they seemed to have forgotten. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Although they were once a famous author was a Zeitgenössin long Tin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920ern, was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they lived, buried in an unmarked grave. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> In Eatonville there were no major commemoration ceremony, no public readings on a large scale. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "I am not thinking that they their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least understood," Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of the 2003 Hurston was published. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The turning point came in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the town, at the Kennedy Boulevard to replace the slow two-lane main street of the community. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Orlandos suburbs have already had the motorway 4 through the western outskirts. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The proposal was introduced as Eatonville still of a difficult time recovering in its history. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Forced integration, among other things, had the relatively idyllic isolation of the community a definite end. </seg>
<seg id="41"> In the 1950s the fight against racial mixing hatred in the community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "In this time was often a bunch of white boys and throwing oranges and stuff on the people who sit on the sidelines," said Mr Franklin. </seg>
<seg id="43"> "It was even once a woman the killing was. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Throwing a Wassermelone from the car. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> In 1955 Hurston behind asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the call of the Supreme Court, integration to force by its decision in the case against the Schulrat Brown as "offensive will my race respektierend" called. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Today, residents say that although the lifting of racial segregation was positively in some respects, the groups in the cohesion Eatonville and self-assurance weakened its young people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> "Black children were used to it, hugged to be - I remember hug, one of his teachers in the morning and his teachers hug on the evening," N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and Managing Director of the non-profit group for the protection of Eatonville Community. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> This could be maintained as long, they added, until teachers and pupils came more from the same place. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "They embraced his white teachers do not, because he was a white teacher - I mean is a cultural divide in place," said Mrs Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> However, the civil rights have contributed to that room for further Zora Neale Hurstons was created - black writers, actors and artists who sat on prejudice, as they did with a positive self-esteem and statements such as: 'How can anyone deny the joy of my society! </seg>
<seg id="51"> I understand it not. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In 1975, the writer Alice Walker was on the way to Hurstons anonymous grave and began for the revival of their glory to fight. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Five years later, was a much promised Hurston-Biographie of Robert E. Hemenway shelves in the books, and made them again to a part of the American Literaturkanons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> The long-distance road project came exactly at a time in the most famous daughter Eatonvilles once again in the public eye. </seg>
<seg id="55"> And this time Hurstons old neighbours saw it as Retterin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> The community began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival in order to demonstrate what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January sweep many for the ceremony. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> A few years later wrote the district of its road-building plans. </seg>
<seg id="59"> "The plans of a five piecemeal highway crowded the city, accelerated the whole thing with the top speed, set real citizens proud," said Mrs Nathiri. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Madam Boyd put it somewhat simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> The victory against the long-distance road project has to a change in the image of the city itself. </seg>
<seg id="62"> There were more and more course travelled as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who since 1993 is here in the church, and residents began to appreciate the past. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> In 1998 Eatonville was in the nationwide historic register. </seg>
<seg id="64"> A new einstöckige library (of course) opened after Hurston appointed in 2006 on the neugepflasterten and verschönerten Kennedy Boulevard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> Today Eatonville is still a feature in Florida: Only 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos can they sometimes feel like a Hintergasse anfühlen in the summer of rain, as small as at that time as they of only 27 black families in the 1880ern was created. </seg>
<seg id="66"> (It is today to 90% black.) </seg>
<seg id="67"> Outsiders in search of the history Eatonvilles and its importance are still often treated with caution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> For most of the interviews is a approval in the run-up to necessary and certain things - as the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles eldest Church, which was painted by a Weissen and black men in the field work is - must not be photographed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a bold, assertive teacher with a preference for Dunkelrot, still fear that their abgeschirmte Community is misunderstood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> And yet, at the same time to the Hurston-Festival greater, was also a greater degree of home pride born. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Young people in particular tend to see Hurston Eatonville as their entire race saw: Beautiful, with all its problems, either worse or better and just as proud, creative and hardworking, ridiculous and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> It is the sincere love for this city of the people in the voice of Mr Franklin nephew can hear, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return after Eatonville, in the town of administrative or the police to work, which he could use a little help. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73"> And even younger people, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville right. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> "Most people who only pass through here, will be thinking: 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the other," said the other day Alondra Kenon on Sunday after the church. </seg>
<seg id="75"> "But if one really stop and for a moment in its history, it is a very nice city." </seg>

<seg id="4"> On the one hand, artists </seg>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, personality </seg>
<seg id="6"> I am looking into private life, in these moments, which are alien to the audience, I know when I for the personality typical gesture, the depth of a stolen survey Ausdrückstärke or the hands, which are concerned because they do not enter the stage, can find. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In his project 'Flamenco-people' is the German photographer Günter Bauer abwechselungsreiche drama typical of some gatherings on the stage with singers, dancers and Gitarristen. From this side, he was for the artists still little known. </seg>
<seg id="8"> With this proposal creates the photographer a special Ikonografie the Flamencodarstellung at different levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The exhibition, which the programme of the month of the photograph of the Flamenco heard, 'reflects the international importance of Flamenco, the day to day is getting bigger and bigger, is ", says the artists and makes it clear that" Flamenco-people' can be any old man, but when we look at the photos, the observer notes that there is no typical images of artists on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Ordinary people on the portraits are artists, who are in a position on the stage passion, sadness, and joy, so that the audience. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The personality of these artists to say, we must make no photographs on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Their personality and her character is in their hearts. </seg>
<seg id="13"> What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere, which would allow me, with the photo camera the characters, the largest Flamencomeister canvas. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Bauer, inspired by the Festival 'Cante de las Minas', in 1997, on a long journey, with singer, dancers Gitaristen or photographed with a digital camera. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Thanks to the picture sorting function of the camera and the existing material, pictures of classic photograph. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The application of different stylistic means destroying the traditional basis of the picture, making the picture modernity and the idea, as the farmer Flamenco understands awarded to be: 'Music with traditional roots, the changed and every day' surprise. </seg>
<seg id="17"> These are not only of the dance, the singing or the Instrumentalspiel itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, his art with the audience blinds. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The search for the essence, after some results, which, in the form of the Hörens, of being visible, and was the firm objective of this work in the next period in the gallery of the El Fotómata presented. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Well-known personalities in Flamenco including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente crony and other are among the close selection of almost 70 artists who have been photographed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The project has been a Anthologie of Flamencos and will soon as book, with all the portraits from the exhibition, appearing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Bauer ’ s passion to the portraits led him to this idea two years ago to take up again and as a 'portraits of the veterans of the sport' ('game to implement Project'). </seg>
<seg id="22"> Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are varied, gives the photographer to 'it like very much photographed people, they know to learn, and in their lives to enable state whether for a brief moment or a long time. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I think that in the area of the photograph the portrait is the most difficult breed. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Du triffst you or encountering people, people who sometimes do not even know, or they can leave you alone for a few minutes, a photo. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to achieve my ideas. ' </seg>

<seg id="5"> Show, what they cost to give him the Oscar. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And when he withdrew in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="7"> And he knew that he was very ill. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Nevertheless, it was a major blow for all. </seg>
<seg id="9"> "What sometimes feels, is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend, 'said Robert Redford weinend,' my life and my country were the biggest Drolligkeiten of his life. ' </seg>

<seg id="11"> 'Father' of the cinema and the country is in a sad moment, died in the fear of terrorists and before the market collapse in the Lower battered self-esteem of Americans on the desperate search for reasons, dignity back. </seg>
<seg id="12"> If in this hard time without virtue only a few people who you can admire, we must not necessarily be Luis Cernuda, Paul Newman to love. </seg>
<seg id="13"> For all he represented virtually a platonisches ideal of beauty and truth. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered losses as well as a number of both profits: From the Foundation, which is dedicated to the fight against drugs and in honour of his son from the first marriage, died of overdoses, was created to its own brand of internal and organic products. </seg>
<seg id="15"> All of this is a gift for the country in which he ran into a lot of trouble, against a deadly food culture. </seg>
<seg id="16"> A broad wave of surprise is high on Hollywood House without regard to nationality and citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the whole era. </seg>

<seg id="20"> "Us is the Größte of all of us leave ', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dare try today to live like Paul Newman lived: High demands on the rectitude, a responsible private life, far away from the cameras. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But there is someone who is trying, and Paul Newman was an example of this. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He did leave a time and was subsequently fifty years with Joanne Woodward married, he was loyal, although it certainly many opportunities were it not to be. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 'Why should I eat a hamburger on the street, if I have at home Filet?', he often scherzte itself. </seg>

<seg id="14"> Well, matters like these are a small matter compared to the days on the streets. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Apart from the fact that we very early to go in order to get the chip, is already a queues of at least 15 minutes and, furthermore, it must be the schoolbag. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The wait has lasted more than 35 minutes, as in the case of a street, where 11 000 people are expected is incomprehensible. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On the 'emerging Technology Conference', am there from MIT, Microsoft has the progress of the new picture detection system and Mensch-Interaktion presented, a system of artificial intelligence without a lot of intelligence, which is capable, however, to do some primitive tasks, such as a taxi order (or in the case of Microsoft is the one routes planners, on the campus of the company to move). The system observed what it during the entertainment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Thanks to a camera and a violation of form and face detection system, can this' Rezeptionistin 'see how many people in the area of who they are and even remember, as they were held, it can listen and the key words of their entertainment understand. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is also the present after the talks in the groups view. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the presentation video noticed Rezeptionistin ',' a third person, but she understands that this person to the group, with their conversation, is not, and that no company employee. </seg>
<seg id="6"> They ask about whether the person who wants to come here and he replies that they will soon be listening. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Everything without the blue Screenshot </seg>
<seg id="8"> Very impressive </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> This is certainly the future. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Now the company has better things on which it can focus, for example, to the next version of its operating system Windows. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This week we spoke very superficial on the change of strategy by Microsoft. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Windows 7 will be more quickly and not so many eingebundene programmes have. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Steve Ballmer, established that if the computer would be equipped with the necessary, rather than with the commercial waste filling, so they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that is only for the few. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Everything is just a statement, given that Microsoft Windows versions in one or other function well 'and' extras. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The change of direction is worth </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing in importance, just as the software. </seg>
<seg id="17"> As a Google chromium appeared in the network, was the part of the theory that it was the first step of Google in order to compete with Windows. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Thickly sent many indications that the Browser no operating system. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to ensure that hardware and software at the same time, can function. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The operating system delivers the role with the operation of his wife or his or her husband can be compared when it comes to something to tell his mother-in-law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> That is true. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The system will never disappear, but it must be to its' death ', not as an absolute, but rather as a relative truth, thinking. </seg>
<seg id="23"> What Ballmer, said this week is the confirmation of this idea. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The people pay less attention to every time the operating system, more the Web-Browser. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The computer will be launched at the Firefox, the Explorer or chromium execute and every day we spend more time on surfing, than in the vicinity of the 'window'. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What serves half in the computer of existing applications? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Less is more </seg>
<seg id="28"> And Windows 7 is more compact, much more compact than vista. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Light, not so exaggerated, less complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The interest of Microsoft's is longer to integrate its online services, then, the alternative to Google. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In reality, they need it, without a doubt. I express a small example of this. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The photograph of this place I have in Redmond, in one of the recovery rooms for Microsoft, employees at the beginning of the month. </seg>
<seg id="33"> On the Erfrischungsgetränkeautomat is fitted a shield: 'Your quest. Our future'. It prints a request from, own tool for Online-Suche to use it. </seg>
<seg id="34"> In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that the 66% of workers in Microsoft, Google for the research in the network used. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Incidentally, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 in the delay is falling. </seg>
<seg id="36"> They will not start, but at the end of 2009 are, even in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Microsoft is seeking the possibility of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time to bring on the market. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Turns every day the telephone in a computer. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by a further to find out who emerged as the victor, John McCain or Barack Obama. </seg>
<seg id="3"> As expected, predicted the QGs on the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats their own victory in this Fernsehduell, that of a third of the American families should be pursued. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's output, although quite handsomely, not 'brilliant' enough was, for him to explain its decline in the election polls five weeks before the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Gallup-Institut of an opinion poll published on Saturday was that Obama is ahead by five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat, clearly the better power. </seg>

<seg id="11"> "Senator Obama does not seem to understand that... ', he stressed several times. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "I do not believe that Senator Obama on the necessary experience and the necessary knowledge, at President to be", he also assured. </seg>
<seg id="13"> An attack point since yesterday in the Republican election advertising is preached. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Meeting - from the blood that safe again was </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yesterday Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And, above all, has it public confidence restored, the by the scandal by the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s, was shaken. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As we know, were the from the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross national blood reserves managed during the 1980's with HIV and hepatitis C virus contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In the face of this tragedy and the public discontent led the government of Canada in February 1994, a public, by the judge Horace Krever led an investigation, the objective was to bring light into the circumstances that had led to a tragedy of this nature, and directives, a fresh disaster in order to prevent this type. </seg>
<seg id="6"> While judges Krever even hesitate to make his report, then, several provinces of a committee on its feet, whose goal it was to a new system for managing blood in Canada to develop. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In Quebec, met the committee Gélineau this task. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the reports by Gélineau and Krever were founded in Canada two blood banks: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, the other provinces and the two territories to take care. </seg>
<seg id="9"> '1998, when their work has included Hema-Quebec, 38% of people had little confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers, Dr Décary. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The situation was disappointing. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Through the enormous efforts to ensure the safety of the blood and to improve the work in this area during the following years, we have to win back the confidence of the public ", says it before it proud stressed that the beginning of 2008 now almost 94% of the population of Quebec Hema-Quebec had confidence in. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, Dr Décary reserves in the knowledge that 'trust is a very fragile ". </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since its founding on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec is, according to the principle of caution. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At that time we saw the emergence of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe with, a new type of the disease, told this woman since 1998, the leadership. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "And we had not the slightest idea whether these disease on the blood could be transferred. </seg>
<seg id="16"> So we have heard on one of the main guidelines of the reports by Krever and Gélineau to the exclusion of measures to be applied, and when you do not know if the disease progresses slowly, as is clear in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that has run through a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So we took in April 1999, no blood of people on, since 1980, more than a month in the United Kingdom had stopped. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Now, a few years ago, it was undoubtedly proved that this disease transmitted by blood. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This event has shown that the principle of caution, which we would apply, is indeed a meaning. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In 1999, appeared on the market a much more precise technology to detect HIV: The Nukleinsäure-Tests (NST), which will make it possible to directly in the blood of the donor to prove the existence of the virus itself, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as in the tests used to date. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The NST enabled it to shorten the incubation period, between the time when the person was infected and that if the first viruses through our techniques can be detected in the blood, is taking place, explains the specialist. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This time in a period of less than a week to be reduced. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Thus, the risk that some donors could be infected, without being aware of it, and we could not see much reduced. </seg>
<seg id="24"> These improvements enabled it to the risk of AIDS through a blood transfusion to transfer to a considerable degree. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Today, there is a risk of 12 million people, with HIV infected blood to preserve. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "In other words, this means that you should distribute 12 million blood before someone infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Since Hema-Quebec every year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood distributed, it would take more than 24 years before a occurs in the HIV on a Blutkonserve was transferred. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I believe that it can now feel well, if we get a blood transfusion or, in order to restore the health ', says the Direktionschefin of Hema-Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "Our challenge for the next ten years it is, the safety of our products. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We will never know which germs can come into the system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Only last year, which is on the island of Réunion Chikungunya-Virus appeared, the, just as the Westnil-Virus, by insects transmitted by blood. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We must monitor incessantly, drives Dr Décary further before they stressed that, in addition to a safe supply Hema-Quebec also provide an adequate supply. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "The demand is rising, because the population is getting older. </seg>
<seg id="34"> As the treatment of aggressive cancer are often the patients need new red blood cells or Blutplättchen. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The ageing of the population also impacts on the blood donor network from which an average of only 3% of the blood donations are appropriate inhabitants of Quebec. ' </seg>
<seg id="36"> It can any healthy person, of the 18 years or older is and the eligibility criteria all 56 days, six times a year to give blood. </seg>
<seg id="37"> On average, to be 14% of people that their blood available, not accepted because they, for example, of AIDS or malaria are ill, and who has been in a country where malaria is prevalent, for a year by the blood donations excluded. </seg>
<seg id="38"> "With these 3% will we make it, an inventory to preserve what the needs of the hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="39"> A lack of supplies are very rare. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But we must renew the Members of this donor network if they get older and are no longer able to donate blood. </seg>
<seg id="41"> It is hard to convince the people, to donate blood, but, above all, to keep them and to produce regular donors. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Life is now so hectic that you rarely find the time, an hour in the blood donation to spend ', regrets Francine Décary. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With an annual budget of $297 million Hema-Quebec provides not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin, almost exclusively for serious violations of fire is used. </seg>
<seg id="44"> This tissue to be investigated, processed and frozen before they are Hema-Quebec stored, the only public cord blood bank Quebec managed. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In the umbilical cord, in the past, was viewed as a biomedical waste, is rich in stem cells, blood, which can serve, serious diseases, such as leukemia to deal with. </seg>
<seg id="46"> "A few weeks ago, we celebrated the stockpiling of our thousand TENs umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan, every year, more than a thousand wane. </seg>
<seg id="47"> "We should start at the beginning of next year, available for transplants to ask", said Dr Décary, this programme of umbilical cord blood as a very popular decline. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "Many mothers are convinced, no such access to have ', because Hema-Quebec lack the resources, this complex and costly programme in all hospitals to offer of Quebec. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Free opinion - The Orwellian speaking of Barrick Gold </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In its edition of 17 September Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, the Canadian gold mine Vize-Generaldirektor Barrick Gold. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirms, following a Orwellian logic that the biggest gold collection society in the world for libel over six million against three authors and a small funds sought a publishing house, with the aim of a 'public transparent debate'. </seg>
<seg id="4"> If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then judge it on the truth, especially in the case of slander complaints, but above the law. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As expected, this fundamental difference was by Mr Garver completely hidden. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As for Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, everyone in the ruin of driving who dares to take a of their opposite view to represent. </seg>
<seg id="7"> No matter how the process is based, the authors and the editor of the book Noir between Canada will spend significant sums to prepare for their defence and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight, the from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine will be paid. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The tactic in this unequal fighting is also often, the defenders to ruin an amicable settlement in order to force the other side is muzzled and also discourages anyone who dares to take once again to deal with the issue. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have their view of the situation in the face of public opinion must present. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By contrast, what in many of the countries in which Barrick Gold is working, and is normally in Canada debates through the exchange of ideas and not by Knüppelhiebe fought. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This could have been enough for gold mine their books and documents disclosed and have a real debate opened by the newspapers, media, publishing and financing of independent Prüfteams, the light on this question would bring. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But Barrick Gold seems no confidence in public opinion and to have dismissed the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir between Canada with a hand. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Could Mr Garver explain how he, at the same time, a 'public' debate can ask and yet the views of these public scorn? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Apparently includes this word in the world of the Vice-President only the generously remunerated lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very nice beengte view of the term. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In a democracy, the detractors have the right to speak. </seg>
<seg id="16"> What Barrick Gold does not understand - or not to understand is that the public, the authors and publishers of Noir between Canada supported, this particularly does, because they the brutal attitude of the gold mine is opposed. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The public is willing, Barrick listen and to judge, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many as Knebel-Klage exercise (in the course of the 'public debate Barrick Gold' has a call to the authors of Noir between Canada, in which she demanded of them, not to use this term...). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, is the complaint of Barrick Gold a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the truth, the essential for any democratic society. </seg>
<seg id="19"> They completely denied the right to quote credible sources and on facts and interpretations to discuss form the basis of the intellectual work. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If it in a country such as Canada is impossible, subjects to research and discuss, the rich companies like this world, who else can it do? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead by the scientific standards by the authors of Noir between Canada have been spent. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It has a right to reply. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The university environment, to which we belong, White for a long time, debates and inconsistencies in the control and conflicts to be resolved. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what they claim, in no mood to a transparent debate. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is a loss for the university world, as it was for the public debate, and it is time for the governments to take measures to limit the this type of unfair complaints. </seg>

<seg id="1"> What has been produced in the bill factory of award & amp; administration.? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On 8 October start the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János award and his accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The defendants, in particular, the participation in the organised crime, and grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts, among other things, accused of falsifying documents. </seg>
<seg id="4"> According to the Public Prosecutor have been the from the tenders lukrierten funds used for his own purposes, while the services provided with counterfeit bills were often proves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Government money and subsidies from the government - a total of 65 million HUF part - in the coffers of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the private individual EU funds. </seg>
<seg id="6"> As the investigation authorities announced, were the retirement does not mean the tender money fictitious invoices presented, and the clubs should not be complied with their obligations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to the indictment, a large part of the bills have been rigged. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The bill blocks have been on the market of Józsefváros purchased that left some seals Kiskunhalas in carrying out. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The decision on what companies should be issued the bills, was on that tour north of Lake Balaton decided, on the István Lados of János award was sent. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the course of this "fact-finding tour" should find Lados pensions and restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He demanded bills on the Konsumationen, later on these texts based bills for the Youth and Sports Ministry, the social and labour ministry, as well as the issue of Budapest. </seg>
<seg id="12"> These bills are predominantly by István Lados and his accomplices, András Őri have been manipulated, according to our information for the Constitution of the relevant reports have been responsible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> One of the objectives of Lados' "fact-finding tour" was a beer locally. </seg>
<seg id="14"> As two of award administration in 2003, according to invoices issued, is the catering business neunzigköpfige group of associations Biztos Pont Egyesület bewirtet have. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But now the head of the company, such a large group would not have been at once in the restaurant suited event. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002, at the Foundation Jobb Jövőért, later known as együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also made serious mistakes in violation of form and content. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and not more than 10 people can house at the same time, according to the Court of 130 guests should be stopped. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The imagination, the Court of counterfeiters were obviously just as no limits, as it was at the Pigal Kft., a catering company, in its accounting records of clients Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá according to prosecutor presented not. </seg>
<seg id="19"> As business leaders Győző Farkas the hvg.hu stated, it was immediately clear that it was counterfeit documents, as him by the Public Prosecutor during a consultation documents have been presented. </seg>
<seg id="20"> "Our company name and the tax number were on the wrong stamp on appropriate". </seg>
<seg id="21"> And further: Apart from form mistakes was also the fact that the company is home to a hundred people have after they have a total of 11 rooms, the impossible so many people place. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Also on the bill is restaurant have been cited, it is the restaurant for some considerable time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The industrious bill counterfeiters also have failed to verify that the of them targeted Budapest travel agency received only offering trips abroad, and then they have Ungarn-Reisen on the Barzahlungsrechnung told what the accounting practice also denied the company. </seg>
<seg id="24"> As in the course of the investigation was known, they also have bills VAT, although travel office services to a country outside the EU, value added tax free. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The level of VAT was a total of four from the hotel to the Foundation Révfülöp Kft. Jobb invoices issued Jövőért wrong, because the operational instead of 25 only 15 per cent VAT charges, will also be of the staff exclusively mechanical bills issued, the false documents were, however, hand in writing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Another mistake, of the "Rechnungslegern" was undermined, was that it, in a case "were transport" as output had indicated, although this of the specialist firm on investment advice is not offered, shared with the public prosecutor. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Further form mistakes - false accounting format, false stamp - was due to the fact that the on együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont invoices issued has been exposed as a fraud. </seg>
<seg id="28"> As in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sport camps Kunfehértó, whose business leaders beteuerten, never to have the bills issued. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Another "mistakes" is the counterfeiters in HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza undermine: This society was to the time (2001), particularly at sunset, when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület there have eaten, the mass administrators were hence, the bills do not even issued. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Fake aware of </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> The other group of Rechnungsleger are people, which was perfectly aware that they should fictitious invoices. </seg>
<seg id="32"> At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták has the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the Foundation együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, for a total of about 4 million HUF issued. </seg>
<seg id="33"> According to the indictment was the executive director of the Collab Kft. by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, for issuing the fictitious invoices persuaded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Now the winding-up order Kft. also Biogate with award and company have worked: In 2003, the Foundation is to the GmbH Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, and the clubs Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with counterfeit bills worth a total of 5 million HUF supplies have focused on not related services rendered. </seg>
<seg id="35"> But there was also little payments, as the bills immediately after their exhibition were cancelled as the victims in their documents, however, have to be forgotten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The third group of Rechnungsleger includes people directly associated with the defendants. </seg>
<seg id="37"> One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian business leader of the Delta Trió Kft., a resident in Budapest, but not auffindbaren fuel and vehicle trading firm. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The company is in the period from October to December 2005 several bills on the sale of EDV-Komponenten worth a total of about 18 million HUF issued. </seg>
<seg id="39"> According to the investigation authority since 14 September 2005 in cash investment Kft. from winding-up order Kiskunhalas acts as a buyer of these bills. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Business leaders of this company was a Rumanian, which the companies also documents Iván Kubatov should be delivered, between 2002 and 2005. </seg>
<seg id="41"> According to our information, has been Kubatov during the investigation, bills on behalf of the GmbH. Atlasz and to the clubs Hoppá, and együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány issued and their value even cashed in. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> The firms Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. of Romanian bricklayers Iván Kubatovs express request to have been set up. </seg>
<seg id="43"> In truth, however, was none of these firms active as loud Angeklagtem was lack of contracts. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Nevertheless, he could benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplices, of the lawyer Zsolt Szente, with the preparation of the firms founding documents was charged, he has, on behalf of the company bills to the award in connection with the clubs issued, such as in Atlasz and Y-Generáció. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> As a whole Kubatov 15 bills in the total value of HUF 14,2 million cash on behalf of the companies investment, Delta Trió, Jos Fa-Bani, Jos Linaxtrade investment and to the organisations have issued. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The public prosecutor's office estimates that 10% of the Court Kubatov sum and the VAT could have cashed. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The company Kubatov even Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition imaginary bills have abused - in this case, the bills were the applications of Biztos Pont resolved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> The firm Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért have their applications in January 2006 in the not-for-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA"). </seg>
<seg id="49"> Both received 500, 000 Forints ever, however, have benefited from these amounts inappropriately. </seg>
<seg id="50"> In order to cover up, they have the TMA five fictitious accounts of the works team Kft. presented. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Moreover, these bills were in the raid on the offices of Árpád Ministry Kemecsei in teaching. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> In the negotiations will now by some of the defendants with a confession on the approach of the Court of counterfeiting, as they have already taken before the public prosecutor, were expected. </seg>
<seg id="53"> A sensation could be, if the main defendants János award to a full confession resolve. </seg>
<seg id="54"> His previous claims were less in detail, and although he had already promised on several occasions, fully to report on everything, from his confession. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The question therefore remains an open question whether this in his interest, whether the Socialists a pact with him about the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million have concluded, and whether award in exchange, is willing to take responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="56"> But it is quite possible that award the "Beleidigten" plays after his appeals to alleviate the imprisonment and house arrest has fallen on deaf ears. </seg>
<seg id="57"> While other criminals, the with economic crimes is far greater damage and these have not paid, at large, or at least under house arrest, remains award this possibility. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The psychology of the Überbietens - or why we are prepared to pay more </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> At an auction buyers tend to spend more and the Feilgebotene therefore to exaggerate the effect. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Neurologists to economic researchers and the University of New York is managed to neurologisch-ökonomischen foundations of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior to discover. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a "Science" magazine publicised study want to the people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, beaten and are therefore not be prepared to pay even excessive prices. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The researchers have tried to the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions to explore. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A group of volunteers Lotto should play, while the other in a play with these action participated in both cases - were the active brain regions of the subjects through functional magnetischer resonance (fMRI) investigated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In two games, the participants were able to win money, but has been increased activity of the Striatum, of a set below the Gehirnrinde, losers of the auction measured in the opponent's sort of an essential role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In addition to many other functions is this brain region for the "even reward" of the nervous system. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The researchers said that the price increase could be by avoiding an overreaction of the Striatums explain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Their thesis to back up, have the economists in the group of researchers in addition studies to follow up the money. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this case, should three groups against a partner under different conditions to bid. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The control group was told the real value of the product, then they have made their operations. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Another group of 15 dollar reward promised, if they emerge as winners from the game. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which in the case of a lost game were also lost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The difference between the two groups was then simply that the emphasis on the one on the profits, while the other was on the losers. </seg>
<seg id="16"> As evidence of the idea expressed by neurologists were the members of the "against the losers' group of games to higher operations ready, as those in the control or the" profit "group. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "These results fall of any previous economic theory. </seg>
<seg id="18"> These have the patterns of behaviour observed in auctions, so far, only to the joy on the profits, or the risk prevention. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The contradiction between these two theories was thanks to the imaging neurological procedure dissolved, so that we now have a third statement of Europe, "said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics faculty of the University of New York. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Hepatitis: When is the doctor? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The world around half a billion people are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary will these chronic liver disease listed among the leading causes of death. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The number of those infected, estimated at hundreds of thousands will, however, be dealt with only seven thousand, what it is that the patients often do not know that they are infected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Hepatitis is the set of caused by different viruses, infectious liver disease. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The symptoms are often similar - Leberentzündung and yellow addiction are often, but differ the pathogens and the diseases from each other. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Depending on the virus spread the hepatitis viruses on two different species: Hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example by contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D are the viruses through blood and other body liquids (such as sperm, or be given spittle Scheidensekret). </seg>
<seg id="7"> Travellers will be a vaccine against the virus A and B in any case, recommended against the virus C there is no vaccine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The symptoms of hepatitis A show around two three weeks after consumption of the polluted food and generally are of illness, weakness, stomach pain and splutter accompanied. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Then comes the yellow on the skin and in the eyes of, the chair is bright, the dark urine, and the recovery to take two for three weeks. </seg>
<seg id="10"> World around 1 million people die every year in the caused by hepatitis B, far more serious illnesses such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The main reason is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected patients is in medication. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: Untreated it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Most of those infected do not even know about their illness, because the pathogen destroyed the liver cells - dressed in many cases show the first symptoms after 20-30 years. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is therefore timely prevention, such as regular inspection must, essential. </seg>
<seg id="15"> There are three groups where the disease is more common: Those who themselves from 1991 to undergo a blood transfusion, drug addicts, and Tätowierte. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the moment, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide estimated at 200 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Since the disease during a routine laboratory inquiry is detectable, it is advisable, at the first signs of unknown origin of the family doctor visit. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In time, the disease is curable, the virus could be eradicated, thus increasing the risk of infection, non-existent, and prevent the development of cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Of the 30 September is the world day of hepatitis, 2004, for the first time in the world of patient representatives. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The aim of the action is the awareness of this chronic Leberentzündung caused by viruses, their creation and the importance of early detection. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Believers have less pain? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> As the latest research results show that religious belief as a kind of "painkiller" all honesty, which already have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Scientists of the Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It was investigated whether belief in God the pain of the people affected, reported the British "Telegraph saying". </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the wake of the rather bizarre investigation ever received 12 believers and atheists electric shocks while they studied a painting of the mother of God. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate the bulk of the pain. </seg>
<seg id="6"> By means of a Hirn-Scan technology could even be demonstrated that the Catholics were able to activate the part of her brain, which is responsible for the pain of regulation. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The study was the first in a research project that also alongside scientists, philosophers and theologians of various departments in the university. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The attempt was one of the subjects funkelndes device attached to the left hand, which made the electric shocks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The participants were asked to hard to concentrate on two paintings: On the one hand, a picture of the mother of God, painted of Sassoferrato, in the 17th century, and on the other hand, Leonardo da Vincis "lady with the Hermelin." </seg>
<seg id="10"> The researchers hoped that the sight of these young Mrs Maria among the believers would provoke a kind of religious blossom, while it identified as Vincis picture, because it is very different from the other paintings and was seen as a reassuring. </seg>
<seg id="11"> People ever spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electric shocks in this time in four stages, while they either the religious, or the other paintings should regard. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Catholics report that they had the sight of the mother of God "in security" felt as if they "surrounded by", and they would be "peace and quiet". </seg>
<seg id="13"> During the Betrachtens of religious Gemäldes they have about 12% reported less pain than if they Leonardos station had in mind. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The psychologist Miguel Farias, also attended the attempt, said that it could be similar effects, also with other, strong images also operating in the atheists, they should be just the photo. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "We would have to find a picture, the very positive sentiments, such as a mother or father," the psychologist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Anglikanische Bishop Tom Wright, welcomed the results of the research. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "The practice of the faith should change our personality, and do it in many cases," Wright. </seg>
<seg id="18"> After these excellent results, the only question is, what effect a Madonna-Bild Leonardos or other comparable Malers on the pain regulation of believers. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Would the high-quality young Mrs Maria even achieve better results? </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> On the occasion of its tenth birthday can Google fair to say: It is in the pockets of the people as to find, as on their heads in the sky: It knows where the people have their holidays spent on the specialist they go and what they moved. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And still not be enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the chief executive officer of Google. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In the direction of skeptics who plagued by Orwellian nightmare visions, can he do: This would be the very essence of the Web 2.0. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main objective of Google, more personal data on users to collect and so the original purpose of the company to come closer to that they "all the information put in this world". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Schmidt said that Google was after ten years of less stable work world still only at the beginning of the information collection. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Asked about the status quo in five years, said Schmidt: He wanted, Google would be able to issues such as, "What should I do tomorrow?" Or "the job really fits me?" To answer, however, software programmes are not yet in a position to do this, because they do not know enough about the users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Not all Internet users are aware that their Internet research in the wake of the search terms were registered, and also the IP addresses, from which was sought, and the two sides. </seg>
<seg id="9"> For example, the two years of imported "Personalized search" allows the visitors to its own search course to store and later resort, so that the hit later can be generated much more precise, and on the same logic based the so-called "Recommendations" with which the system tailored products and services as a result of the previous preferences recommends. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The users help wondering what in the event of a data abuse is happening, "If you look what I make", are some concerned whether the Google-Datenmonopols. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In most cases, however, it is more likely to be represented by the company, potential power, the terrifying works, and less the sense of guilt or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rebellion against the power, the many Internet-Usern to reject forces. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, it is a proven fact that the search terms not only stored, but if also be passed on to third parties, and in this legislative cases, there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet-Users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> A perfect example was recently the action against paedophilia in Brazil, in which Google the Brazilian government information on submitted by the Gemeinschaftssite called "Orkut" were collected and also an identification of Pädophilien enabled. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Personal rights concerned users could breathe a sigh of relief, but in May, as Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF successfully against the FBI before Court withdrew: That Google can also in future with no point to the constitution to force the FBI information on secret question issue. </seg>
<seg id="15"> (However, the federal government has successfully the publication by 50,000 Webadressen and 1,000 search understood in years, with reference to the youth protection law passed obtained, but she was the list of individual users, or its Web- and search term list retroactively denied on two months.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Google's image remains controversial: Those that their personal data are reluctant to issue because it through the use of the Google service the loss of their private and space are afraid to criticise the company with the conservative performing firms due indignation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> However, does the American "Geek-Kultur", which is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users unites, the next generation of "coolen entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leaders, even if both at the same goal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> A possible reason for this is that Google its users, in contrast to Microsoft requires no identification codes, and his services available for free, so that an open, constantly updated source code Programm-Package and far more attractive, juvenile and seem to be cooler than the official practices of the software giant. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the other hand, says the Geeks of the problematic relationship of the personal rights and the Internet in the sharp knife - a relationship that, particularly in the past few years, thanks to the concept of "Web 2.0" in the centre has arrived. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> In the "Web 2.0" is, in fact, nothing else than collaboration, in other words, the users deliberately left lanes and use the available channels of communication, and even if the proportions of individually are varied, remains the main cause the same, namely to show publicly. </seg>
<seg id="21"> At the same time, an average of young people can be run on several Gemeinschaftsportalen profile - from Facebook on Xanga, can this through other services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm link, and can all this, finally, in a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm engage. In addition, she blogs can lead, the latest photo galleries are automatically on Flickr and Picasa geostet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> And a number of other exemplary cases: Looking at the photos of the Party last night take place the girlfriend soon, with whom it has disloyal friend rubbing, or the staff will be made redundant because it in his blog only too honest his anger over the management of air power, one thing is certain: The word "privacy" was interpreted now completely new. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Who leads a Online-Leben, is what he summaries of, for example, could be in the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And anyone who tries to keep secret something, or even the Google-Monopol, which can do - such as with Scroogle, a Tool, which is on the search engine of Google grab, but deliberately leaving no trace. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Many people deliberately did not register at Community sides, so that they are not ever-higher standards, but also the Online-Applikationen of Google, such as text processing and grafische RSS-Feeds tools and can be handled with alternative versions in no huge server farms are linked, and therefore is not the best possible profile generated by users. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Public opinion is away, however, until Google shows its true colours. </seg>
<seg id="27"> With its current value of USD 156 billion is the company even before IBM 140 billion (USD), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the advertising of AdWords / AdSense threaten the revenue of the advertising agencies, and the faster services not only introduced for Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Critical observer, however, find the disturbing against poles: For example, the company has led a protest of staff totally rejected after the charges of the company ’ s kindergarten were doubled, it also meant the management, the frequent meals of the staff is too costly. It all seems almost mild against it but that Google in 2006 before the Chinese government even in the knees and was with an agreement, according to which all hit the regime, or those who are against the good taste, would be extracted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The internal rules of the group is that in advance no new services will be advertised, but only when this already is also available, but the events of the next few months and years some change again sharply: While some think that Google's Buch- and Magazinscan- or archiving project now take note, the company will soon have to grapple with the Supreme Court, however, are different because of the system "health" worries, the drawing up of a full health profile on the basis of the findings, doctors and problems. </seg>
<seg id="30"> And the fact that Google a genetic database is built, provides the next generation Sci-Fi authors of the substance, "for example Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian fashion a future in which a man as a result of Google data nahbar frightening. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> What would be the best method for the development of new technologies to accident prevention, if not the Hindernis-Sensoren from the natural to imitate? </seg>
<seg id="3"> For example, the of the bees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the CEATEC Japan was a startling project presented, in which the Nissan-Ingenieure of Hummeln in the creation of new accident vermeidender systems were inspired. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In cooperation with the Tokyo University Autorobotern Nissan the controlled type biomimetische system BR23C built a Mini-Auto, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Any bee in the air is their own, oval "private sector," which our own "shield" is very similar, said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for Technologie-PR and research development, in the exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The eye of the bee up in any direction and in a corner of over 300 degrees can see, plays a major role. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The function of the kind to imitate eye, the researchers blew the idea of Knife lasergesteuerten gap. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It identifies BR23C obstacles in the face in a field of 180 degrees within 2 metres, their long distances and sends signals to the Mikroprozessor on Board, which immediately precedes the kollisionsvermeidenden process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The barrier will be registered in a split second, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by the tyre at the relevant corner spin. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Unlike previous systems take place this ploy rather than purely instinctively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "If it were not so, the car robots could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the "Laboratory (TRL) mobility" and Autoroboter-Projektes. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The system must react instinctively, and immediately, because the technology the innermost and most vulnerable part of us from recession - is a class, within the accidents are currently still considered inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The entire process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if they other bees. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And that must be conducted in the fraction of a second. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, the exile, in contrast to the bee, not upwards, down, or even diagonal be done - it can only be developed along two dimensions, and only in the direction of the tyres Wendbarkeit. </seg>
<seg id="17"> During the bee here are infinitely many options open to sidestep other bees, the researchers were in the car robot only the Drehbewegung, or of speeding up and Abbremsens serve. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BR23C contains Lithium-Polymerbatterien, the easier and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer life than traditional Lithium-Ionenbatterien. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Andoh said that it will be on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and still less on the ability to store them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> This device per second only a few inputs must process and respond appropriately to them. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It must not store them, or on the basis of previous exercises an intuitive, logical response produce, so that there are just a handful of KB Memory. </seg>
<seg id="22"> There is no need for Gigabyte- and Megabyte-schwerer Memories. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, the reckoning of Nissan within the next ten years serial moderately in production will be. </seg>

<seg id="6"> The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on the result: The programme will be efficient and it will be effective, but we must do more. According to Pelosi were not talking about the rescue of Wall Street, but about the helm of the economy rumzureißen. </seg>

<seg id="11"> We are satisfied with the progress made in the middle of the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to promote stability in our markets and our economy to protect, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The programme, however, is different from the original recommendation from the Bush administration that the 700 billion dollars on again for the purchase of the lazy, with loans of strain in the securities should be spent. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a first tranche is to a maximum of half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages spent, and 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the issue on Monday. This amount to the purchase of the strain in the credit, bad securities will be spent, and on the further USD 100 billion to the President to decide. </seg>

<seg id="16"> In the spirit of the law, the Treasury can also apply a combined tactics: At the same time it is bad loans, mortgages, and with mortgages purchased using securities and other "toxic" loans. </seg>
<seg id="17"> As competent people of the Ministry reported to the purchase both in an auction, and directly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The law allows the affected companies to participate in an insurance programme, in which the Treasury guarantees the worrying resources, and the companies are expected to damage the appropriate pay fees. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary resources so that up to 700 billion dollars as emergency aid for the American financial system can be made available, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad resources, their insurance, or the prevention of a systemic risk by the collapse of a major financial institution will be triggered. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The necessary steps are, so that we are prepared for the introduction of the law, as soon as it was signed, so Paulson. </seg>

<seg id="22"> Reducing the pay will only be in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury aushilft each. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The cut essentially means that if the Ministry in the framework of an auction buying, the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the outgoing head of banks in the pension deported. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In the case of a direct purchasing the moldy lending aggressively, making the government to ensure that the managers ’ salaries are not excessive. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The picture also heard that the existing Golden Handshake-Verträge not be changed - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that the more people to participate in the programme. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This is the first case in American history that cuts in Manager-Gehältern be regulated by law, commenting on the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Russian observers think that this lies in the prosperity and stability in the by Alexander Lukashenko's country, the OECD, however, suspects illicit goings-on in the counting of votes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The OECD, the 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> De term is the 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates for decades without opposition from, but has the under the name of "United Democratic Forces (ODS) rallied against party before yesterday ’ s elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, the in the Ugly Elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment 2006 his presidential mandate for the fourth time renewed, this time a few members of the opposition in Parliament 'permit would". </seg>
<seg id="6"> That is why the ODS even of the previously planned boycotts gap. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Ukraine is thanks to the rising price of gas, imports of ever more dependent on Russia economically. For the relief of the price increases were even credits included, and the country also has the sell-off of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline through the country, leading to the Russians. In the light of the expectations of the opposition was thus the hope that Ukraine wants to improve its relations with the EU, after Lukashenko and other senior politicians because of the classified as anti-democratic political system in the EU travel ban. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> For a temporary relaxation, the evaluation report of the elections of the OECD, in which the emphasis on the positive movements, rather than the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidate from the elections - was. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> However, the quickly criticized the OECD report on Monday, the campaign - that the opposition should not occur in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition in the counting of votes was allowed to be present. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Despite this, the opposition can see an improvement in the political system: Some political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is even smaller confrontation with Moscow by the recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia denied, although Russia, with the Ukraine on paper a Föderativstaat forms, the two regions as independent for a month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "We have two steps forward and a backwards made, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our tables. </seg>
<seg id="12"> According to the opposition candidate for the presidential elections of 2006 is a continuation desirable, although "the powerful jitters also have only one opposition members of parliament to be". </seg>
<seg id="13"> The opposition is not planning any protest action in the face of the results, but rather trying the need for economic reform to the voters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> "We have here with many problems to overcome the opposition newspapers - must be printed in Russia, the local authorities are getting in the way of the distribution, but I see that more and more people support the change, even the elderly," said Milinkevich in allusion to the fact that not even the most aid layer of the Pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose sole merit the production of social security. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "Thanks to the debt of the country and the rise in the trade deficit is just a matter of time before the to the silence of a Friedhofes gemahnende 'social security" is beginning to crumble, "Milinkevich. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Unlike the opposition politicians have Russian observers described the elections as democratic. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the deeds, and not words." The lack of the opposition is therefore a test of the maturity of the Belarussian electorate. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The elite is in danger </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The phenomenon had already revealed a few days ago, as the House of Representatives against the 700 Milliarden-Dollar-Sparpaket agreed by the White House: A large part of the Americans was and is more interested in the Wall Street rather than punish the economy to save. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This confirmed yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reported that, as the crisis over step the Republican party divide, severing the increasingly in their old and moderate East Coast-Seele, which has always been the public institutions and the business community and those favoured neo-conservative, the "those in Washington," and the world of finance and other hostile to primarily in the south, and the centre of the states voters wins. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This part of the party primarily owes his rise to the voice of the I mentioned above. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This aforementioned example, however, is only a small part of the great changes that the current economic earthquake or even already announced: Not only in the United States, even in the entire West, and perhaps, on this also affected by this. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In both states, as well as the crisis in Europe seems the long feared events to speed up the under these new conditions are finally taking shape to accept and come to light. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first of these phenomena is the recent discovery, the extraordinary renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In fact, the crisis means a decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close links to the outside world and, at the same time, a huge amount of assets managed by private households, live in a single state. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This means a direct political problem for the governments: Namely as it with the affected families need to act, what an enormous voters mass. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The crisis is global so economically, politically, on the other hand, is it almost purely national. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The political internationalism seems to be sidelined in his right to speak to have lost: The obvious proof has been given by the EU, which because of their division into different national and international conflicts, a common way to find White. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Therefore, all now count with the intrusion of the state; rescue plans, new rules, and primarily a). Distribution of aid: Since the crisis was ever more serious are the United States on the economic situation without foreign aid to save. </seg>
<seg id="13"> And in addition to the funds also have the legitimacy to use those: Thus two cannot be value at the end of conditions in certain circumstances – – in what otherwise no international organisation and not a market can use in a similar way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The new emphasis on the staatlich-nationale element, is in perfectly compatible with the ever-increasing importance, the recently in the economy with a closely associated related sector: The territoriality. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It is now very stark way than we so convinced, were long in a networked overall rich to be entered into an empire of the increasingly differentiated technologies, of the non-material that we suddenly see, as our future but more and more of the essential material things will depend, of water, harvest and oil. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This can certainly all from one place to the other of the world will be transported, are nonetheless at extreme with a clearly defined piece of earth – a territory. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So is the person on such a territory, a on others, in a crop yield, water unemployed or free area of oil is alive in the advantage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I now turn to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short way. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Anyone who territory, who government, who policy says that say leadership. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena. </seg>
<seg id="21"> On the one hand, there is the awareness of the need for Distinguished Leaderships, the need for someone who knows how it regulates. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On the other hand, is now a wave of indignation about the existing leaders, including those primarily to the economy, which was as inadequate and full of shadow zones have explained. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Moreover, a deeper far-reaching, and in some ways even more worrying aspect: A loss of confidence, a impatience, a picture of the futility, a sense of distance, all the a whole class of managers of Western countries. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It seems the belief among large parts of the population to pave the way that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but their ideas world, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, are, whose salary the majority always as foreign and outdated. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The demand for leadership feeds so an elaborate underground storage but powerful movement of the removal of the political class and the traditional political establishment. This manifested itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and the sudden shift of the collective soul, state of the last time, starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, on the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, the rebellion of American Members against Bush (and perhaps also plays the victory of the rights in Italy a role). </seg>
<seg id="26"> One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their observance, magazines, intellectuals, creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and thus less representative value of what nowadays in the bottom of the social strata of the West is going on and reinforced by the financial crisis and to Überdimensionalität driven. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In view of all this, it would be purely exaggerated, of a "rebellion of mass" to speak. </seg>
<seg id="28"> But the eyes wide open to keep, however, is certainly not. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The historic cinema close because of the beneficiary Multiplexkinos. </seg>
<seg id="3"> "A city with no cinemas is a blind city, as a face with no eyes." </seg>
<seg id="4"> This image of the film director, Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what now in the large urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces, is happening. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The process of exclusion of the cinema, with the birth of the large multinational Chamber complex in the periphery, began to mean in the long term Einsaalkino death in the centre. A process that not only seems inevitable and irreversibly, but also a cultural crime. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Affected mostly historical sites are full of memories, "it is like losing a friend with whom you were a bit of emotion has come down," the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" him 20 years ago the Oskar and the big price of Cannes. It is the story of a Vorstadtkinos and its nostalgia, what is it, in a good for ever lost cinema world. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The figures, which the Standardisation -, the key industry association provides, speak a clear language: In the last five years have the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinema must close; this bill paid the bulk of the cinema in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The worst affected regions are part of the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This shows that the main culprits are the Multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions, in which the greatest number of this modern cinemas have been recorded, with 195 in the last 5 years leading the lists of Lombardy, 81 have it both in Tuscany and in the Emilia-Romagna. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "The business has developed in an irrational way," Paolo Protti, the President of the Standardisation -, "it is useful to have new structures, but to come first, the preservation of already existing, for a room in the city, not all its habitués ready to replace the old one Multiplexkino in the periphery to visit. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And here is still the lack of budget for the fund of the industry association äußer: The state recorded debt amounts to some EUR 10 million. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral position that the government does not respect the existing laws. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In order to maintain the sector, would be between 16 and 18 million per year by needs ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which because of the fears about the old cinemas decided that this by an agreement between the community and to protect the Standardisation -; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect the traditional cinema and to support both in the historic centre, and in the periphery. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Among the measures are also expected tax before divisions for the cinema operators, and the benefits for the audience on the transport: It will be permitted in the verkehrslimitierten areas of the centre and also to travel to lower parking fees to park. </seg>
<seg id="16"> "It is a welcome initiative," Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and, moreover, still new concepts design. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> But we also need a better Audio- and video equipment, against the superpower of the Multiplexsäle something to do, after all, is the audience of more demanding. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The defence of the traditional cinema is for me has always been an important issue: The closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the tipping point of me got, the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso" to base, even if I have for 10 years ago with the idea had played. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For 25 years, I live in Rome; if I on the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale over agree, where I saw so many different emotions, drehe I me to the side, not the staubbedeckten posters to see. </seg>

<seg id="1"> If the energy from the waves springs suddenly run the Great on </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is a source of money versiegende, what about 70% of the surface of the planet and it is only now that the big energy companies seem to understand the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Waves, tides and currents are the new renewable energy sources at all times, and also seek to occupy, such giants like Chevron. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The possibility of energy from the movements of the sea to win, is already in account for 70 years and studied; it is no coincidence that intensified these studies since the first oil crisis, considerably. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As the price of oil by 1980 vergas caved to the idea of marine energy, but now urge the environmental organisations and the increase in the price of oil to new impetus in this sector. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world long energy needs from the energy produced by the ocean waves could be met. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This would be the as much honey as the current energy produced by nuclear power stations. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Moreover, would be added the currents and tides. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Giants in the attack. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The first firm, which is now on the marine energy, is Enersis that in 2005, a treaty for the construction of a power station in the north of Portugal has signed. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As the news was published it seemed a revolutionary step to act. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Two years later, there are now more and more companies in the traditional energy sector, which for the marine energy production. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Chevron analyses these technologies", the spokesman of the American giant well-known company in the Wall Street Journal – and compensate the possibility is to cooperate with us. " </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is the creation of an authorisation from the US Energy Commission, which deserves a project off the coast of Alaska to start. </seg>
<seg id="15"> This is not to be underestimated as a sign that things primarily when you consider that it is still in Alaska oil would be supported by the United States and President Bush recently even the plans for new Bohrungen set in motion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In addition to Chevron are also the firms Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey to invest in the new industry; the details are not known, but so are talking observers from a rising interest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Even improvement dignified technologies. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Experts speak of a still at the start, when technology, not least because there is not the last doubt from the environmentalists are resolved. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So far, there are projects such as the one in Portugal and Scotland seem rather minor dimension and no serious environmental problems to cause. </seg>
<seg id="20"> However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, is technologies with far greater impact on the environment. </seg>
<seg id="21"> There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, is using a system of interlinked Bojen. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The burst of the waves, which has moved on and rain Bojen, within the swimmer Kolben hat on and in hydraulic pressure converted. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This is forcing a Turbine, which in turn is a generator. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The electricity is out on underwater pipelines sent to the coast. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Until now, there are four planned investment of this kind, which only to wait for the government approval. A part of its energy could also be used for military facilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Verdant power produced energy, however, were already for a department store and through a Parklatz unterseeischer turbines in the East River in New York. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The water movements during the tidal forces the turbines, which by the burgeoning Drehbewegung the surreal generator. </seg>
<seg id="28"> According to the Verdant has been waiting a long queue of potential clients on the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Only the waves, then the tides. </seg>
<seg id="30"> A special interest deserves, according to the Institute for power generation research for the moment, the potential, which is in the tides. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Although it also an irregular phenomenon, but the tides are more unpredictable than wind currents, the sun and the waves, and therefore look like a more reliable source of electricity. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It is precisely the tidal energy is what federal states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states have already $7.5 million in 2008 – to invest for 2009 are already up to 35 million planned. </seg>
