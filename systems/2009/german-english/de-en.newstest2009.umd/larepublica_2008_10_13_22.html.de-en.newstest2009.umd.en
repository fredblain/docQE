If the energy from the waves, suddenly the great on 
It is a non-exhaustive money source, which cover about 70% of the surface of the planet and only now seem to understand the big energy companies in the world. This 
waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources to the now all, and seek to occupy, giants such as Chevron. 
The possibility of energy from the movements of the sea, is already in account for 70 years and studied; it is no coincidence that intensified these studies considerably since the first oil crisis. 
as the price of oil to 1980 crumbled Vergas we pushed the idea of marine energy, but now the environmental organisations and the increase in oil prices to new impetus in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated that 15% of the world's energy needs could be met by the energy produced by Ocean waves. 
This is double the energy produced by nuclear power stations. Now 
also the currents and tides. 
giants in the attack. 
The first company, is now on the marine energy, Enersis, a treaty in 2005 the construction of a power station in the north of Portugal has signed. 
When the news was published seemed to a revolutionary step. 
Two years later, there are now more and more firms from the traditional energy industry, on the marine energy. 
"Chevron examined these technologies" - as the spokesman of the American giants well-known company in the Wall Street Journal and WÃ¤gt the possibility to cooperate with us. " 
It is the creation of the American energy commission that is needed in order to launch a project off the coast of Alaska. 
This is a significant sign, particularly when you consider that it is in Alaska to oil promoted by the United States, and President Bush recently launched the plans for new drilling. 
In addition to Chevron, the firms verdant Power Inc. of New York and ocean power from New Jersey who invest in the new industry; details are not known, but observers talking about a rising interest. 
improvement technologies. 
Experts speak of a technology on departure, not least because the last doubts from the environmentalists are resolved. 
projects such as Portugal and Scotland of more small dimension and seem to cause no serious environmental problems. 
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, we need technologies with far greater impact on the environment. 
There are various possibilities: Ocean power, for example, is using a system of related Bojen. 
The burst of the waves, which Bojen and move down, within the swimmer on Kolben and Zylinder in hydraulic pressure converted. 
This drives a turbine, which in turn a generator. 
electricity will be sent on under water on the coast. 
Until now there are four planned plant of this type, which are still awaiting the government approval. Part of the energy generated could also serve on military installations. 
However, verdant power produced were already energy for a department store and a Parklatz through Unterseeischer turbines in the East River in New York. 
The water movements during the tidal drives the turbines, which by the central movement the generator. 
According to the verdant has been waiting a long queue of potential clients on the necessary authorisations to use this energy sources. 
Only the waves, then the tides. 
A special interest, according to the institute for electricity profit of research at the potential in the tide., 
Although it is a phenomenon of irregular, the tides but predicted better than wind currents, the Sun and the waves, and therefore a reliable source of electricity. 
The tidal energy is the federal states such as New York, Maine, Alaska and other coastal states led, already 7.5 million dollars to invest in 2008-planned for 2009 are already up to 35 million.
