intelligent car imitate the flight of the Hummel 
what is the best way to develop new technologies to accident prevention, if not the obstacle-sensors from the natural to imitate? 
For example, the bees. 
presented at the Ceatec Japan was an astonishing project, in which the Nissan-engineers of Hummeln in creating new accident avoiding systems were inspired. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan's car Biomimetische Robotern managed system of the type Br23c built a mini-car, equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. 
Air is any bee their own Oval "privacy", is very similar to our own "Shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology-Pr and research and development, in the exhibition. 
The eye of the bee together, it in every direction and a corner of about 300 degree can see games play an important role. 
The role of the composite eye, the researchers the idea of laser-controlled distance knife. 
It identifies obstacles in the Br23c in a field of 180 degree within 2 metres, their distances and sends signals to the Mikroprozessor board, the collision avoided process immediately. 
The barrier will be registered in a split second, and the car robots immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees, by the Tyre revolves around the corner. 
Unlike previous systems will take place this manoeuvre purely instinctively. 
"If it were not so, the car robots could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the laboratory "mobility" and the car robots-project. 
The system needs to respond immediately and instinctively, because the technology the heart and most vulnerable part of the shield-a class, within the accidents are as inevitable. 
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if they avoid other bees. 
and that must be the fraction of a second. 
However, the duck, unlike bees, not up, down, or even Diagonal-it can only be two, and only in the Wendbarkeit of tyres. 
While the Bees are infinitely many opportunities to other bees to avoid, robots, researchers from the car only the hub of the movement, or of speeding up and Abbremsens. 
The Br23c contains lithium-polymer batteries, the easier and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium-ion Enbatterien. 
Andoh said, it is the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of data, and even less to the ability to store them. 
This device, only a few inputs per second process and react accordingly. 
It must not store, or on previous manoeuvres an intuitive, logical response produce, so that there are just a handful of KB takes memory. 
There is no need for gigabits-and megabyte-serious memo Ries. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate Collision Avoidance technology, according to Nissan series will be moderate in production within the next ten years. 
Another application could find the technology in the GPS satellite navigation, by the drivers deliberately around obstacles and his destination.
