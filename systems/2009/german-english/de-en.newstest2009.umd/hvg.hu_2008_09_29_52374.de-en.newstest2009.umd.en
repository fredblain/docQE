the psychology of the Ãœberbietens-or why we are prepared to pay more, 
at an auction, buyers tend to spend more and the Feilgebotene therefore exaggerate. 
neurologists and Economic Research at the University of New York, it is managed, the logical neuro-economic basis to discover the known and apparently irrational behavior. 
According to a "Science" magazine published study to the people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, not beaten and are willing to pay high prices. 
Researchers have tried to the neurological system this "game" to explore with experimental auction. 
A group of volunteers should play lottery, while the other attended a play action-in both cases, the active Brain regions of the subjects through functional Magnetischer resonance (Fmri). 
Both could play the participants money win, but the increased activity of the Striatum, a complex below the Gehirnrinde, losers of the auction, which offer on the opponent plays a key role. 
Along with many other functions, this brain region responsible for the "reward" of the nervous system. 
Therefore, the researchers said the price increase by avoiding over-reaction of the Striatums explain. 
In order to maintain their thesis, the economists in the group of researchers further studies to follow the money. 
In this case, three groups against a partner under different conditions with. 
The control group was told the true value of the product, then they have their operations. 
Another group has also promised 15 dollar reward, for the case that the winners from the game. 
The third group was $15 before the auction, in the event of a lost game also were lost. 
The difference between the two groups was then simply that the emphasis in the one in the win, while the other was on the losing. 
as proof of the neurologists's hypothesis, but members of the "against the" Games group prepared to higher operations than those in the control-or "profit" group. 
"These results are from any previous economic theory. 
This is the behaviour observed in auctions so far only with the joy of the win, or risk prevention. 
The contradiction between these two theories, thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we are now a third statement, "said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics Faculty of the University of New York.
