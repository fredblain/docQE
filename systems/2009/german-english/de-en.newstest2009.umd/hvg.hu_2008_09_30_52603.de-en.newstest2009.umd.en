You are what you on you Mitteilst 
At its tenth birthday, Google and right to say: It is in the pockets of the people as well, as their heads in the sky: You know where the people have spent their holidays, the doctors they go and what they moved. 
and that is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google. 
in direction, the host be plagued by Orwellian nightmare visions, he is: these were just the essence of the Web 2.0. 
In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main aim of Google, more personal data about users to collect and so closer to the original purpose of the company, which they wanted to "all information of this world order". 
Schmidt said Google was after ten years of world changing work is still only at the beginning of the information collection. 
Asked after the status quo in five years, Schmidt: he wanted, Google would be able to questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what job is really me?" to answer, but software programs are not yet in a position to do this, because they do not know enough about the users know. 
Not all Internet users are aware that their Internet-research the Suchbegriffe registered, and IP addresses, which sought, and visited the sides. 
For example, the two years ago introduced "personalized search" allowed the visitors to retain its own Suchverlauf and later using them, so the hit later can be generated much more precise, and based on the same logic, the so-called "recommendations" which tailor products and services due to the previous system preferences. 
The users are asking what happens in the event of a data abuse - "if you look what I" - show some concerned whether the Google monopoly. 
In most cases, it is rather the potential power, represented by the firm that terrifying, and less the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the quest for freedom or the rebellion against the power of many Internet users is rejected. 
It is, however, a proven fact that the Suchbegriffe stored not only, but in a case in third, and in these cases, there is no protection for the personal rights of Internet users. 
a perfect example was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, which Google the Brazilian government information, the community site called Orkut ", and also to identify the PÃ¤dophilien. 
personal rights concerned users, but relief in May, as Google, along with the civil rights organization EFF successfully against took the FBI to court: so Google May in future with no point of the constitution be forced on secret information the FBI question. 
(the federal government has successfully the 50,000 Web addresses and 1,000 Suchbegriffen, referring to the years ago adopted youth protection law has been obtained, but the list of individual users, or their Web-and search term list retroactive to two months.) 
Google's image remains controversial: those who like their personal data, because the use of Google services fear the loss of their private and privacy, scourges of the company with the conservative performing firms due indignation. 
However, the American "Geek culture" which is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and unites users, the next generation of "Coolen entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, thanks to Windows is market leader, even if both fighting for the same goal. 
One possible reason for this is that Google its users, unlike Microsoft no identification codes required, and its services free of charge, so an open, constantly updated source code and programme-package far more attractive, young people and appear to be cool, the official practices of the software giant. 
On the other hand, says the Geeks of the problematic relationship of individual rights and the Internet Messerscharf-a relationship, particularly in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" in the focus. 
The "Web 2.0" is nothing more than collaboration, in other words, the user deliberately lane and use the available channels of communication, and if the size vary individually, remains the main thing the same, namely to show public. 
an ordinary young people can manage at the same time, several community portals profile-from Facebook on Xanga, this with other services, such as twitter or music services such as last. FM combine, and all this is finally in a follow-up system such as Friendfeed or blip. FM. Furthermore, can you blogs, the latest photo galleries automatically to Flickr and Picasa Geostet. 
and a number of other classic cases shows: looking at last night's party photos will take place as soon as the friend, with whom your disloyal friend rubbing, or the staff will be dismissed because he only too honest in his blog his anger over the management of air power, one thing is certain: the word "privacy" has now been completely new. 
who leads an online life, is what it of price is in around the basic idea could be behind the behaviour of today's youth. 
and anyone who tries to keep something secret or even the Google monopoly, can do so-such as Scroogle, a tool, which is on the Google search engine wide, but deliberately leaves no trace. 
Few people register deliberately not at community parties, so that they are nowhere, but also the Google online applications, such as word processor and Grafische tools and RSS feeds, deal with alternative versions, which are linked to a huge Server parks and therefore not generate the best profile the users. 
The public opinion however spellbound waiting until Google shows its true colours. 
with its current value of $156 billion, the company even IBM (140 billion USD), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the advertising area Adwords and AdSense threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the faster services not only Microsoft introduced, but also other software headache. 
However, critical viewers find the disturbing polarities: for example, the group rejected a protest by the staff completely after the charges for its own nursery have been doubled, also said the management of the various restaurant staff is costly. All this but seems mild about Google in 2006 before the Chinese government even in the knees and with an agreement was that all regime critical hit, or those who violate the good taste, filtered out. 
The internal regulation of the group is that no new service advertised in advance, but only if this is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the next few months and years further upside down: while some think Google's book and magazine scan-and archiving project now proportions that the company will soon need to address the Supreme Court, so other because the system "health" worried that a complete profile on found, doctors and health problems. 
and the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of sci-fi authors said the substance, "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow best Orwellian fashion describes a future in which a man you Google data is frighteningly close bar.
