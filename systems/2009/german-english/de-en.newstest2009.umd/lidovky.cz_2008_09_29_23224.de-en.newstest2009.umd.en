the Sudeten Germans demanded a referendum by the United States 
the Sudeten Germans had in 1945 to the incorporation of Bohemian forest to the United States. 
This is from a letter, in the collections of south Bohemia scientific library. 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With such a desire to 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans have contacted the US president. 
This is from a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and today in the collections of the South Bohemian kept scientific library. 
The German ask Krumau in the letter the American president that he should the return of the "Sudetengaus" - on the basis of the Munich agreement was adopted by Adolf Hitler-cannot afford to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have understood the situation and want to really be sure of the words that the American units not oppressors and enemies on German territory, but as liberators", says in a letter, with the words "people, which the fate of Sudeten Germans signed heart". 
Since the end of the Czechoslovakia Sudeten Germans-in knowledge of the Czech national character-suggests that you brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery would expect, ask the author of the letter the American President, for now and forever the rule on the Bohemian. 
"We cannot believe that without regard to the view of a quarter million inhabitants of this area for US foreign state grant, the oppressed minorities and tried to remove and has done nothing of the allied victory", is to read the letter. 
The reason why the author not can sign, is supposedly the fear of revenge hungry "Czech oppressors". 
If the US president have doubts about the affiliation of Bohemian German, is it enough, if it is in the BÃ¶hmerwaldgau would initiate a referendum on whether the inhabitants are part of the United States or wish to live under the protection of the United States. 
Though the text of the letter in today's knowledge of the postwar history might sound naive, he, however, according to some witnesses a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans. 
Even if the Bohemian German at least guessed, that their removal from the Republic would negotiate, that only a few of them at all. Such a possibility 
Some waited for the United States and Britain for the Sudeten Germans would negotiate a kind of autonomy. 
Others believed they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia. 
also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, the bud dates. 
He was in the war as Budweiser German in the Navy used in the Baltic Sea. 
When he came at the end of the war in British captivity and brought him in a prisoner of war camp in Holstein, dozens more Bohemian German to him that he should teach you Czech. 
"They believed that when they come home, the Czech would come to pass," Chalupa. 
None of the German prisoners of war, who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, on his view that it on the basis of the ways decrees from the Republic would drive.
