in their sleep talking 
Some children at night 
I do not believe those who wake up and tell us something in what happened the day before, but the child during the sleep. 
If it is for the first time you, in the best case scenario, you will be shocked, but in reality, the no importance. 
It is a positive sleep disruption, the talk in their sleep. 
It is fairly common, especially among children and young people. 
Certainly, was told more than one of you that you have spoken night. 
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (a time in life, for example, as during the high fever), or regular (every day, once per week, once a month), the next day the child to remember nothing. 
There is no reason this phenomenon. 
often sought links with other phenomena in sleep, as nightmares, terrified night, Enuresis Noctura (Bettnässen night), in their sleep, but there is no reason for it. 
as we mentioned earlier, it can in very high fiber, stress situations or on demand. 
In any case, it is a little Erforschtes phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it occurs, is very variable. 
It may be that the calm in individual words, Flüstert or it can be a contrary (cries, wines, long debates). 
In those cases, if the statement is very hard, it is recommended that the child and specialists, to discuss, to examine whether a problem, which caused fear and in this way. 
We have said that it is a positive disruption, so it will not dealt with, whether it is with a different sleep disorder, which can be treated (for example, with the sleep-Apnoe or stress). 
What we do is, a series of simple preventative measures: 
try not to arouse the child before sleep. 
So, quiet game for the child choose and avoid stress-television programmes, the terrible and a little too wild. 
The nervous children, which recommended tensions, can be applied relaxation methods, to help them to get some internal calm. 
This helps the child to sleep. 
If this happens again in their sleep, tried to remain calm. 
remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will be to not remember what happened. 
useful advice 
It inspires. 
This is useless, because the child is unconsciously, so will pull it from the sleep. 
Although the baby, sleep, so it rests. 
Remember, though it remains a few hits shows, recommends, to discuss or what the child for the fear. 
If you understand what it says (which is not usually is), the baby under pressure to carry out an interrogation and information out. 
so you will able to achieve nothing, because if the baby is sleeping, it is not and will not reflect. 
Also, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says, so you have to be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that it. 
Perhaps, says the child is not that her the night and know his secrets. 
not even as a joke. 
This caused much fear. 
So, you is not concerned, there is nothing wrong, this is a moment that lasts only a few minutes.
