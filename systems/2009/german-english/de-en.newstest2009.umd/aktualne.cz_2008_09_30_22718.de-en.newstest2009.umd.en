After the accident, on the bus are stewards illegal? 
The law does not, in a distance coach is not permitted the run around 
In connection with the tragic accident involving a bus society student agency near the Italian Padua raises the question of whether stewards and travellers during the journey in the bus-and running. 
"We wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activities of stewards in breach of the law on the road", the spokesman of the transport ministry Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, in the last week a 22-year-old stewardess died, was the driver of the lorry caused, the path of the bus. thwarted 
The young woman sat in this moment to all accident apart from the driver, at the least safe place in the car, even though she had two other seats still available. 
A bus can also have an accident in the moment or sharply slowing down in the steward of coffee and newspapers from. 
also plays a role, if the bus the vehicle letter is also equipped with Stehplätzen. 
If this is not foreseen in the bus, the travellers. 
long-distance buses from student agency do not have Stehplätze; the director of the company, Radim Janura, against Aktuáln.cz confirmed. 
"We discussed this with the Department, and this has not approved the movement of passengers. First 
Later it back, and we have reached a consensus that the passengers must go to the toilet during the trip, if you have your seat ", he told his position. 
The law makes no steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of stewards-no law describes this role. 
There is, however, no law prohibiting the carriers to provide services. 
The law on the roads have only the concept vehicle crew; the rights and obligations defined it does not ", the spokesman of the ministry Hanzelka clearly adds. 
The director of the Department of Transportation Department vehicles Josef Pokorný, however, believes that the law covers this issue. 
"It is important, whether the bus in the product has Stehplätze. 
This is everything ", he said. 
Buses are divided in city buses, where there are Stehplätze and the maximum speed limits is permitted, local buses with Stehplätzen and a higher speed and distance coaches without Stehplätze with the highest permitted speed and, with safety belts. 
As the plane, says expert 
The Besip expert for traffic safety Jaroslav Hoín seen in the movement of stewards not a fundamental problem on board a bus. 
"In a liquid driving threat of many dangers, the situation is comparable with the service on board an aircraft. 
here, too, is not sure when turbulence and the stewardess, the head. " 
"slowing down but a bus strongly, then, of course, apply the laws of physics. 
As in the city bus or tram. 
The safety of the stewards must resolve the carrier through internal rules ", he says and believes that this issue from the point of view of the law will not be fully resolved. 
Janura is prepared to remove the services 
Student Agency offers the only bus company services of stewards. 
The company employs around 200 people in this role. 
The director also sees their work after the accident as risk prone. 
"As soon as I get the impression that the profession of stewards risk prone, I will remove it. 
Coffee and newspapers can travellers in boarding. 
This would also reduce costs, "he says. 
as interest in the safety of the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin, the lack of stewards in his buses. its society, but only a fraction of lines compared with student agency. 
"We have no stewardesses, we opposed it from the start. 
Sooner or later it with any fatal accident ", he was not quite a year ago for Týden.cz. 
It was an incredible tragedy 
The accident involving a bus lines to Naples was a young stewardess from the region Pilsen suffered, the two years had worked for the society. 
The Slovenian truck was probably without flashing the hard Abgebogen and had the bus journey. 
The driver of the bus tried, by a sharp manoeuvres to avoid, collided with the right front part of the truck. 
The two jobs for the stewards were sold, denies Janura. 
"These places are reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked." 
The firm wants to sue lorry drivers. 
with a compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency will not wait for the court, but expected a financial compensation from the guilty. 
a change in the law? 
not in sight 
a more precise movement of stewards could bring a regulation on board a bus to a team of experts thirty of the transport ministry is already working on a year. 
"This however is still no concrete conclusion. 
buses are not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones in the journey ", expert Hoín. 
"The Ministry of Transport, the activities of the stewards as something that could threaten the safety of passengers much," Hanzelka, and control the security of buses in the hands of the police and the health authorities.
