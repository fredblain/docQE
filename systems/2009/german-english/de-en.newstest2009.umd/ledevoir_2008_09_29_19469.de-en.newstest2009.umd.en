INTERVIEW-the blood that was safe again 
Hema-Quebec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec is one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. 
and above all it has public confidence restored by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s, was severely shaken. 
As you know, were administered by the Canadian Red Cross blood services national blood reserves during the 1980's with the hi-virus and the Hepatitis C virus contaminated. 
Given this tragedy and public discontent, the Canadian government in February 1994, a public, by the judge Horace Krever led investigation, it aimed to bring light into the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and directives, in order to prevent another disaster of this kind. 
While judges Krever still delayed, his report, then several provinces, whose objective was a committee on its feet, a new system for managing blood in Canada. 
in Quebec, met the committee Gélineau this task. 
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever in Canada two blood banks: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and Canadian blood society, the other provinces, and the two territories. 
'1998 Hema-Quebec began their work, had little 38% of people confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr Décary remembers. 
The situation was daunting. 
The enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood and by work in this area during the following years, we have the confidence of the public back ', it says that before they stressed that proud at the beginning of 2008 nearly 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec. 
However, Dr Décary reserves in the awareness that something is very fragile confidence. 
Since its founding on 28 September 1998 Hema-Quebec after the principle of caution. 
This time we saw the number of cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, told the woman who holds the leadership since the 1998 establishment. 
"And we had not the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood. 
so when we are on one of the main Krever reports and Gélineau directives, the exclusion, it measures apply, if we do not know this and if the disease progresses slowly, as it appears in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death. 
So, in April 1999, no blood of people in more than a month since 1980 had stayed in the United Kingdom. 
Now, a few years ago without any doubt demonstrated that this disease over the blood. 
This event has shown us that the principle of caution that we apply, is a sense. 
In 1999, on the market a much more precise technology to identify HIV: the nucleic acid testing (NST), which will make it possible to directly in the blood of the donor prove the existence of the virus itself, and not what the antibodies against the virus, as was the case in the hitherto tests. 
The NST allowed to shorten the incubation period between the time the infected person and, if the first viruses through our techniques can be found in blood, said the expert. 
This time could be reduced to a period of less than a week. 
The risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it, and we could not see much reduced. 
These improvements enabled, the risk of AIDS on a blood transfusion, to reduce significantly. 
Today, one of 12 million people is at risk of with HIV-infected blood. 
"In other words, that distribute blood to 12 million, before someone infected with HIV. 
Hema-Quebec each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood distributed, it would take more than 24 years, before a case, in the HIV on blood automatic. 
I believe that we can now play feel, if you get a blood transfusion or prescribed to restore the health ', says the direct them head of Hema-Quebec. 
"Our challenge for the next ten years is the safety of our products. 
One never knows what pathogens can reach into the system. 
Only last year, on the island of Réunion the Chikungunya virus appeared that, just as the Westnil-virus, transmitted by insects on the blood. 
We must continuously monitor ', continued Dr Décary, before they stressed that Hema-Quebec alongside a secure supply must also provide a sufficient supply. 
' the growing demand, because the population is ageing. 
The treatments for cancer aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells and platelets. 
The ageing of the population is also on the average blood donor network that the only 3% of the donations appropriate Quebec. ' 
Every healthy person, the 18 years or older, and the eligibility criteria, all 56 days, six times a year, blood. 
On average, 14% of people, their blood available, not accepted, because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and who has travelled in a country where malaria is widespread, is excluded from the donations for a year. 
"With these 3% we create an inventory, meets the needs of the hospitals. 
A lack of supplies are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of this donor network, if they are older and no longer a blood donations. 
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all, you and make them regular donors. 
Life is now so hectic that you rarely can take the time to spend an hour in donations', Francine Décary regrets. 
with an annual budget of $297 million provides Hema-Quebec not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone marrow transplants, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin, the almost exclusively in serious violations of fire. 
these tissues are being analysed, processed and frozen before with Hema-Quebec between are stored, which also managed the only public cord blood bank of Quebec. 
In the umbilical cord, which was previously seen as biomedical waste, blood is rich in stem cells, which can serve, serious diseases such as leukaemia. 
A few weeks ago we celebrated the stockpiling our thousandth umbilical cord blood test, and we plan to buy more than a thousand per year. 
' We should start at the beginning of next year, it available for transplants', said Dr Décary on this programme of umbilical cord blood loss describes as very popular. 
' many mothers are convinced, have no access to ', because Hema-Quebec lack the resources, this complex and expensive programme in all hospitals offer Quebec.
