letter-a Entehrtes country. 
Mr Vic Toews, ex - 'Justice' - Minister (the irony) the cabinet has led by, last summer, it was to say about Louise Arbour, it was a 'disgrace' for Canada. 
This woman who has led a never-ending battle for justice and all our admiration, to cover with opprobrium says as much about the people around the Prime Minister, as Stephen Parker. 
We are dealing with a government, which is the only for all the countries affected their Guantanamo prisoners in concentration camp compatriot has not taken home. 
A government that not even considered that Omar Khadr was still a young person, as the things happen, accused of him. 
The only government, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaking its word and a child soldier to languish in inhumane conditions. 
The only one who is reduced to a justice parody, to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Let us remember that especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers argue, Omar Khadr to get home, that he will get a fair trial in Canada. 
This is the government also closes its eyes to the torture: they are not interested, that a young adult after so many years of torment for will always be spiritually broken. 
We are not yet aware, but what we are witnessing is an insidious cut our rights, freedom and our 'democracy', this word, which by as a flag in front of it, and it sounds from his mouth so hollow. 
It is time, in which there is no longer any moral: a Canadian citizens arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprisonment of government, as they see fit, which is supported only by the minority (will he after 14 October in the minority ...). 
Many voters believe their salvation in a party that preach virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has broken from the what the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The shame, Mr Toews, is in this Lossagung, and nowhere else.
