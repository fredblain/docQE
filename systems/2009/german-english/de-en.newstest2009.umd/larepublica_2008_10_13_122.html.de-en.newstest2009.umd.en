to see the old Cinema Paradiso the towns close their historic cinemas 
The historic cinema close because of the beneficiaries Multiplexkinos. 
"a city without cinemas is a blind as a face without eyes." 
This picture of the film director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect currently in the major urban centres of Italy, and in the provinces. 
The exclusion of cinema, the process began with the birth of big multi-room complex in the periphery, in the long term the death knell for a house cinema in the centre. A process, not just inevitable and irreversible, but also the outlines of a cultural crime. 
Most historical sites affected are full of memories, "it is like a friend to lose it has come a little streets full of emotion", the director of the film "nuovo conference Paradiso" of him 20 years ago an Oscar and the Grand Prix at Cannes. It is the story of a Vorstadtkinos and nostalgia, what it is, to live in a well-for lost world of cinema. 
The figures, which the particular, the main Industry Association, are clear: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas must; this bill paying the lion's share of the cinema in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 and 5 in Palermo in Turin. 
The areas most affected include the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This shows that the main culprits are the Multiplexkinos, because it is these three regions, in what was recorded the largest number of this modern cinema: with 195 in the last five years, the Lombardy lists, 81, both in Tuscany in the Emilia-Romagna. 
"The business has evolved in a way that is irrational," Paolo Protti, the president of the particular, "it is useful, that new structures, but on top of the preservation of already existing, for a house in the city are not all its good, instead of the old visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery. 
and there is still a lack of budget for the Fund Industry Association Äußer eight: the debt is around 10 million Euros recorded by the state. 
It is a shame the ethical-moral position that the government does not respect the existing laws. 
in the sector, would be between 16 and 18 million Euros in the year needed". 
interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, because of concerns about the old cinemas has decided by an agreement between the community and to protect the particular; it is the first such agreement in Italy, which aims to protect the traditional cinema and support, both in the historic centre, as well as in the periphery. 
Among expected measures are also tax before divisions for the cinema operators, and benefits for the public transport: it will be allowed to drive, the transport limited areas of the centre and also to lower parking fees Park. 
"It is a good initiative", Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also new design concepts. 
but we also need a better audio and video equipment, against the superpower of the Multiplexsäle can deliver, because it is the audience of today demanding. 
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important issue to me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, where my childhood and youth, was the tipping point, which led me to the "nuovo conference Paradiso ', even if I had played with the idea for 10 years. 
I live in Rome for 25 years and when I look at the Rialto or the Quirinale via Nazionale on, where I have seen so many different emotions, is about me to the side, not the dust covered posters to see.
