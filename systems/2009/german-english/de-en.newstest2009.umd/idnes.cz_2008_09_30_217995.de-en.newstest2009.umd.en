duel on a knife edge: MP3-player against mobile phones. 
we discussed it in your election 
While nearly every mobile phone MP3 files can take place, is still not MP3 player phone. 
It is, of course, that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
Despite everything, there is plenty of reasons why we should create an independent player. 
The election is the kind of use and the demands of the future owner. 
Buy it is difficult for a brilliant expensive plates at home, in order to listen to the latest album From Maxim Turbulenc. 
The first such musical new do not seem to LPs, and qualitative view there is no objective reason for it. 
However, they have LPs with kind of rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, dream you probably at least of such. 
So it is with the music on travel, with condensed music, simple-music in the MP3 format. 
here too there is price and quality categories. 
Perhaps it is not acceptable for one, for a player to spend eight Kroner, but is also a Pink Floyd-fan unlikely headphones for 20 Kroner from the market cope. 
two extremes, between those there is enough room for everyone. 
The selection is diverse. 
The life of the battery is crucial. 
Some good music player can do a lot more than just music playing, but what phones can you not even hints. 
No modern equipment is so universal as the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, the phones and Sim Sen, music and videos, both, it has a better time to have a worse photo and can perhaps also navigate. 
and if the Smartphons and communicators, almost a small computer in the pocket. 
It is a small miracle, because no fridge can crickets and no television pictures. 
But the universality of mobile phones also disadvantages. 
The more you to use your mobile phone, the more often you will have to invite, however,. 
and the place of music is one of the largest energy savings. 
Only a few phones can music longer than ten-place 12 hours, mostly it is much less. 
In this regard, music player (easiest) clearly more efficient. 
You should count in the cheap mobile phones that they no longer than a few hours of music playing. 
If they then and still buy they preferred to security or a loading equipment for office-that also applies to more expensive equipment. 
In MP3 players, they do not have this problem, the less good at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with a time loading. 
Another problem is, if you want to play the music on mobile phone on. 
Unfortunately, only a small part of the equipment on a USB-conclusion, also is not every mobile phone without special software directly to a PC. 
of course, the music directly to a storage medium on play, but only a few card reading equipment without reduction deal with the tiny storage cards, which are used in mobile phones. 
players they need to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
They need the device only on USB-port to feed with music from your PC. 
Most mobile phones and player, a music library, formed after the name of the performers, the title of the albums, the gender or the assessment by users, for example. 
Some devices are only the tree structure of the lists of addresses list, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (Iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
players are easier to use mobile phones can be more 
The selection of a specific equipment, particularly after the lifespan of Akkus, the storage capacity, the quality and type of Klangs and, of course, ask the operator of comfort. 
Music is all aid and hear them only briefly in the trams, then, for example, every day is any mobile phone, the MP3 files. 
What can really almost every mobile phone. 
They must also not very monitor what music formats, a mobile phone or a player can process. 
MP3 create all, and most of the music they get, is precisely in this format. 
The format is one of the most popular and most equipment can also music in Wma format. 
less is usual AAC (a format that Apple and its use iPods). 
better phones will also be buying music online. 
One need only on mobile Internet the sides of providers (or any other service), and you can buy a song or album. 
This service can already and for a striking argument for why we should create a music mobile. 
Unfortunately, the supply of providers bad and are usually confined to rapid Radiohits. 
Prices are also not the lowest. 
But the assumption is that this type of sales of music (on GSM, Internet and wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future. 
The mobile phone, most in. 
If you want to listen to something, you after the mobile phone in the expected, while the player at home. 
However, it is important, whether they are headphones or at least a wireless free speech in themselves. 
If not, you can at the integrated resort loudspeakers, almost every mobile phone, but only a few MP3 player. 
Probably the greatest benefit of music phones for many in the price. 
The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand Kronor. 
for three-and four crowns, they have a very decent Walkmans. 
The biggest handicap for the most that are not normal headphones. 
the best and most technologically sophisticated phones with a 3.5-mm-opening for normal headphones costs up to fifteen thousand Kronor. 
the advantage of the player is the easy service. 
The simplest-and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use each. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity in service with the normal Kassettenrekorder earlier or record players, for example, is obvious. 
There is no conflict in the form of mobile Internet mistakenly employees and then horrendous bill for data transfers. 
The equipment we should now resort 
The cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) are generally on a slot for exchange storage media (type M2, Microsd, etc.). 
Even if the card to buy, two crowns. 
But respect. 
The base models are usually only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB supported. 
Only the most expensive can 8-GB memory cards read. 
if you already have a mobile phone and wanted to buy a cheap MP3 player, then pick up after Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver. 
depending on the capacity (Max. 2 GB) then they should not more than 1100 Kronor on the table. 
They are demanding listeners, they prefer specialized phones-Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent Bedienkn√∂pfe comfort for MP3, and the work is so in a individual MP3 players. 
Most is Sony Ericsson, the mobile phones of the series Walkmans the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours maximum) make you MP3-player of the aforementioned manufacturers.
