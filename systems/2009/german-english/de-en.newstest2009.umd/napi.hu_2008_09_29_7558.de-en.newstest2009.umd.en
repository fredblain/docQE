Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the outcome: the programme will be effective and efficient, but we need to do more. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but the helm of the economy Rumzureißen. 
The written version of the package before the opening of markets in Asia, and Washington time Sunday evening at 8 p.m. (central European time Monday 2 a.m.), published, but has no soaring on the stock.

The programme, however, the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion to purchase bad, with loans contaminated Securities should be spent. 
In a first tranche, maximum half of the 700-billion-amount be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the congress will vote on the issue on Monday as expected. This amount will be used to purchase credit strain, bad securities, and on the other to USD 100 billion the president.
