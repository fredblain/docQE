rats have feelings 
a rat or a Schabe flight in risk means that they also fear? 
The neuro scientists Joseph Ledoux is convinced: More animals have feelings. 
But how could one check whether they feel the same, if you like we behave? 
In the Internet magazine 'edge' contributions famous scientists published for several years. 
Mirror presented online in a series of selected answers to the question, "What do you think of true, without being able to prove it?" 
I believe that animals feelings and other awareness conditions, without that I or anyone else this where we have so far proved not to prove that other people aware. 
But in this case, we must at least hope, because all human brains the same basic configuration. 
But as soon as we turn to other species and issues of sensitivity or raise awareness in general, we are impassable terrain, because the hardware agrees. 
If a rat in danger, it is the same as many other animals: it is dead, retreats or addresses. 
people behave similarly, which some scientists to a comparable subjective experience. 
However, I do not believe it. 
two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult, our subjective experience to the animals. 
A close almost always with the human consciousness associated circuits for Prefrontal Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and the executive -/management functions). 
This broad region is much more developed than the people the other primates and seems to lack in all other creatures. 
At least those aspects of our consciousness that depend on Prefrontal cortex, including the know who we are, and the ability to plan and to decide, there is reason to believe that the man is different from other primates. 
another tragic character, in the linguistic nature of the people: because such a large part of his experiences with language, it has often been said that the awareness is from. 
In this case we could exclude animals. 
But even if awareness depended not language, would certainly affect it, so animal awareness, as it may be found, probably very of most of our consciousness-conditions differences. 
It is difficult to identify, as awareness in other animals may be. 
If, as something and subjective, neither judge nor, given the specific hardware, based on our own experience analyse, so his research we face great problems. 
Most of my comments relate to the content of the deliberate experiences, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, the scientific should be easily accessible. 
It could be the awareness processes of animals, irrespective of their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the Visualisierung. 
But this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, moved it on the neural Korrelate awareness rather than on the causal mechanism: they may or may not be identical. 
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the Prefrontal cortex, for achieving the Visualisierung. 
What is now for the feelings? 
I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system as the fear in a conscious brain activated its own activity. 
What we refer to as the "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves, if the activity in the brain Lokalisierten defence system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) working memory. 
So, feelings closely linked to those areas of the cortex, the primates and in particular to the people. 
together with the linguistic nature is fine we varying degrees of sensitivity, because, with the help of words and grammar distinguish situations and able to categorise it for others as well as ourselves. 
Antonio Damasio says, for example, that sentiments from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the brain cortex and the tribal similar Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain stem. 
as this network in the course of human evolution have not changed much, it could be involved in GATT of overarching sentiments. 
In theory, I cannot disagree, but I think it is Unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues that in rats and people like fear appear, is probably in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and people feel the same, if you behave in the same way? 
A fleeing Schabe at risk if they fear? 
in my eyes can mere behaviour like this does not equal experiences show. 
It helps the neural comparison: rats and people have similar brain tribes, Schaben, not even a brain. 
But the brain stem is responsible for feelings? 
and even if the evidence for the people: as wanted to prove it in rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), feelings. 
But I do not know how I should prove it. 
and because their sentiments will likely radically from our own (as the human consciousness based on specific, and language), Erforsche I prefer the emotional behaviour as the emotional feelings of rats. 
In any case, this progress on the neural level, if we in rats and people the same. 
as I Erforsche language and consciousness not in rats, feelings, as I do not know whether they exist. 
You may think that is short-sighted, but I am rather than constantly run against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist.
