The first virtual providers is already in this year after the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market is mature in the Czech Republic, Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they offered by its partners in western Europe. 
still missing something here-a virtual providers, the classic to lower prices. 
Perhaps this will not long to wait. 
The Czech mobile phone operators to the most expensive in Europe at work, we have often on mobile.cz reported. 
It also confirmed the telecommunications authority tú, the attention that the price of a text messages is higher here than in the rest of the European Union. 
According to the latest steps taken by the European Commission in regulation of roaming charges it is probably to a paradoxical situation for some customers of the Czech mobile telephone text messages from cheaper abroad than at home. 
How is it that the prices are so high in the Czech Republic compared with Europe? 
The answer is simple, there is no competition, the really a challenge. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, there are three mobile phone networks in the Czech Republic and a penetration of far more than 100%. 
The mobile phone providers rant against like that there is very much competition on the Czech market. 
The often agrees, the chairman of the Council of the Czech telecommunications authority (TÚ) Pavel Dvoák, in, often said in the past that there is no place for another supplier in the Czech Republic. 
It is likely that a classic providers with their own network has not so many opportunities (and he would probably also almost frequencies). 
But there is still a possibility-a virtual providers. 
The entry of virtual service providers in the mobile phone market, a significant price reduction, on which the traditional mobile operators had to respond. 
There were before the advent of such firms such as Tesco mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain, similar in the Czech Republic. 
But it has shown that there is room for such providers and that this can be successful. 
Moreover, it does not take long to find examples. 
In February of this we have on the launch of the virtual mobile provider King in Poland. 
in just half a year, this providers, to win more than 100 thousand customers and so the five biggest supplier of the country. 
Mobile King is the financial group Penta in Czech Republic including submarines: FON. 
The advantage of virtual suppliers is that we can concentrate on a much more specific target. 
in order to be able to function effectively, need virtual service providers are much less customers as a classic providers. 
You need a relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
in the world, the virtual providers normally as a low-cost companies-they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which often accompanied by a less extensive service. 
for example, Tesco mobile in Britain SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as the example of mobile King in Poland, it can also be a very good move, a Klischeehafte target. 
Those suppliers is specifically aimed at men. 
"Real Kerle choose mobile King-the providers, you like and they can trust", as David is, the CEO of the mobile entertainment company, the company this virtual supplier. 
It's hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could foothold in the Czech Republic. 
Doubts also Vodafone's press officer Miroslav epický: "the Czech market for a market segment, based on the most virtual operators, relatively small. 
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the services. " 
In the Czech Republic chance, my mobile phone operators 
But it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile providers conquered Czech Republic, this will not be mobile King. 
"We talk about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations were not very hopeful. 
There will be more to a market entry of mobile King in other countries in our region ", says in a telephone conversation for mobile.cz Jana Studniková, press the financial group Penta spokeswoman. 
indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile provider in the Czech Republic this idea not biased. 
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor. 
their interest in a launch of a virtual mobile provider shows the GTS Novera group for some time, the one step further, a real competitor from Telefónica O2 in wholesale. 
"We have a great interest in our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services. 
and the sooner, the better. 
This opportunity we have negotiated with all Czech mobile operators. repeatedly 
with some of them we have already negotiating progress ", the group's press spokesman Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps now better times. 
No official information shows that the first virtual providers may be expected by the end of the year. 
But this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. 
"At the moment we do not assume that exists in the Czech Republic for a full virtual service providers. 
the Czech market, to other markets specifics. 
so far has no entity with a complex and serious project in this area ", says in his statement for mobile.cz Vlastimil Sre from the press department Telefónica O2. 
on the nature of the Czech market, other providers. 
The press from T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the declaration of O2 added: "So far, we have not yet viable and mutually advantageous project found that we could build." 
It adds: "the network of T-Mobile until the end of the year is hardly a virtual service providers. 
At this moment we should already have a concrete offer before, to think so in the short term. " 
Vodafone directed his attention more to meet the requirements of its 3G licence. 
Miroslav epický says: "We are open for negotiations with potential virtual providers, in particular in the area of division of costs and infrastructure. 
This is what we see as the best from the point of view of the customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in search of a partner to create a shared network for a rapid mobile Internet. " 
The authorities-with the suppliers hand-in-hand 
Mobile phone operators is easy to understand another providers would be more competition, this would lower prices and also lead to a decline in profits. 
So why should we facilitate such a competitors entering the market? 
The providers can pull together, when it comes to something, shows the long and talking about the emergence of submarines: FON. 
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of the tú was at the time when U: Fon on the market, from T-Mobile society. 
The show also publicly accessible information from the tú websites. 
Now lends itself, submarines: Fon as argument why we should not allow a virtual service providers. 
Martina Kemrová said: "the competition environment of the mobile phone market was also recently by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider. 
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player in the market, and particularly its services would high demands. " 
Given this approach of cell phone providers surprised but the absolute lack of Czech regulators. 
It is not only about the attitude of the tú in Czech, unfortunately, unlike Britain and other developed countries-not the competence to intervene in the economic competition. 
This is only the Office for the Protection of economic competition (Úohs). 
But this referred to this whole issue its typical attitude. 
"The market of a virtual mobile provider would be possible after a contract between a mobile phone providers and a virtual providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
To date, there has been no such contracts, because the potential interested bid was probably not sufficient for the traditional operators interesting ", in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of the foreign relations department of the Úohs. 
Representatives of the supplier would not surprise. 
an authority, representing the interests of consumers, among other things, to ensure that no one abused its market position, this is more than worrying. 
especially if Kristián Chalupa added: "abroad, where virtual providers are normal, is that its market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services." 
But the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and not a price reduction to the interests of the Úohs. 
In this case is truly shocking almost touching the line of the three mobile phone operators, the result from their reactions. 
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, is obvious. 
Just as the absolutely same petrol price at the pumps is only coincidence and the result of tough competition. 
"The authority has discovered no evidence in this matter to an action against the competition, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter. 
None of the supplier has a dominant market position, so he has not increased responsibility for his actions on the market. 
the necessary tools for the opening up of the mobile phone market for virtual absence probably also the regulatory authority for telecommunications providers ", in its statement. Chalupa 
The interpretation of a dominant position on the market is one of the many points. 
There are, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the tú, after the telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market. 
In such a market, then, of course, none of the Czech mobile phone operators in a dominant position. 
But some legal experts offer a different perspective-for entry of a virtual supplier is always require approval by the network operator. 
and the mobile phone operators, - logically-for its network the monopoly. 
which means that he in a certain segment is necessarily a dominant position. 
Even if not being with this argument, it should be a warning for the Úohs striking resemblance to that three mobile phone operators. 
The show complaints a number of interested parties (including the GTS Novera mentioned society) that negotiations with all providers in very similar obstacles. 
The shifting of responsibility in the tú is a common trick the telecommunications services, with the Úohs distanced itself from the whole affair. 
This was observed in a number of similar cases. 
Unfortunately, it is not possible to the recently adopted changed the telecommunications law enlarging the powers of the tú in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised an improvement of the situation. 
The representatives of the Úohs must know only too well, but they have other interests. probably 
It is, if nobody watching 
Unseen once the functioning of any pseudo-virtual service providers, which in the Czech mobile networks several. 
There are companies that own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but only part public. 
It is usually the firms operating in multi-level marketing. 
mobile telephone services for Amway Bohemia Telecom, Star life and others. 
The price lists these firms are normally only selected. 
the joke of the matter is that the company against the operators as a classical firms customer, a large number of SIM cards. 
As an important customer, he then special price offers (and other offers). 
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone providers a similar sale ban. 
"Should there be cases that you describe, then it is a violation of the contractual conditions, where we are then, which brought an end to cooperation with the relevant society", said Martina Kemrová to our question on this issue. 
It is quite unlikely, however, that so something on the leaders of the mobile phone operators not spread. 
particularly in the case of the three companies mentioned, to thousands of customers. 
But no operator opposes such an approach. 
The activity of these firms go to you is not negligible gains, at the same time, they will-unlike the real virtual providers-not be affected by the official marketing. 
potential problems, Miroslav epický ATTENTION: "the law enabling these types of speculation, despite the services of these firms used only a very small percentage of customers. 
They must also accept that the SIM card in your phone is not in your name, you cannot fully on as normal customers mobile providers. " 
But this should tú alone at least strange. 
Besides another question for the Úohs. 
The mobile phone operators such an approach the eyes, why block against a virtual providers? 
It added that the Úohs has fairly strong powers to uncover such activities, and if it does not, it must not with the declaration of providers, they know nothing and their business conditions would ban this satisfied. 
when the Czech Republic is no longer most expensive 
As has been said repeatedly in the text, the market entry virtual providers a sharp price drop in the various services. 
Virtually all countries, where virtual operators, the traditional operators tried, which virtually to prevent more or less. 
The arguments were virtually identical they use-a small, or too much Gesättigter market, problems with the quality of services. 
in advanced countries but attacks in these moments the regulators, not the interests of the mobile phone operators, but tried to maintain their customers. 
whether through formal or informal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operators, and this followed further. 
Unfortunately, throwing the Czech regulators the whole case as a hot potato. 
based on our experience we can not get rid of that confusion in the competence in these cases more than good. 
But we do not throw the towel in grain. 
If the background information and soon a virtual operators, the Czech mobile phone market may soon be moving again. 
If a supplier to the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, the Úohs will not sit idly by when it comes to other interested reject (to discriminate against). 
and the Czechs are finally no longer expensive phones than the rest of Europe.
