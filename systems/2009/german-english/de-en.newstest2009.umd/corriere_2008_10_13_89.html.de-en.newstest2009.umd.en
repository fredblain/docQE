The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had already demonstrated a few days ago, when the House of Representatives against the 700 billion dollar savings package the White House agreed: a big part of the Americans and is more interested in punishing the Wall Street than to save the economy. 
This confirmed yesterday's edition told the New York Times, which, as the crisis over the Republican party divisions, increasingly divided in their old and moderate east coast-soul, always the state institutions and the business community placements and the neo-conservative, "in Washington," and the financial world is hostile and fifth in the south and the centre of the States electorate. 
This part of the party owes his rise fifth of voice, I mentioned above. 
This just mentioned example is only a small part of the major changes to the current economic earthquake or even: not only in the United States, throughout the West-and perhaps even beyond this will be affected by this. 
in both states, as well as in Europe the crisis seems to speed up the long feared events, which under these new conditions finally shape and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the extraordinary Renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
In fact, the crisis a decline of banking and financial institutions, the close links to the outside world and also a huge amount of assets of private households manage, live in a single state. 
This is a direct political problem for the governments: as it to behave towards the affected families, what a huge mass voters. 
The crisis is so global economically, politically it is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems to be isolated is in and his speech to have lost: the obvious evidence of this has been given by the EU, because its division into different national and international conflicts to find a common path. 
So now all with the intervention of the state; rescue plans, new rules, and V. A. distribution of aid funds: since the crisis is serious, only the US economic situation to save without foreign aid. 
and the resources they have also the legitimacy of using them: two not judgmental conditions, under certain circumstances, on what otherwise is not an international organisation and no market similarly recourse. 
The new emphasis on the state National element is perfectly compatible with the ever-increasing importance on, the recently in the economy is associated with an intimately related sector: the Territoriality. 
Paradoxically, it is now, as we were so convinced, long in a networked total-occurred in an increasingly different technologies, of the intangible, that we need to see, as our future but will always depend more on the essential material things: water, harvesting and oil. 
All of these can certainly be transported from one place to the other in the world, but nevertheless extremely closely with a specific piece of earth-a territory. 
Why is the one who has such a territory, another, in a Ernteertraglosen, Wasserlosen or oil-free area lives, the advantage. 
that brings me to the second innovation, requires a brief digression. 
Anyone who territory and government who policy says, saying leadership. 
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two complementary phenomena. 
On the one hand there is the knowledge that need strong leader ships, the need for someone who knows how things. 
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation about the current leaders, including those of the economy, which have zones as inadequate and full shadow arrangement. 
In addition, a deep-reaching and in some ways even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, impatience, a picture of futility, a sense of distance, all on a whole class of managers of the western countries. 
It seems so convinced in large parts of the population in the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but their ideas world, their way of life, culture in the broadest sense of the word, are, whose salary the majority than others and outdated. 
The demand for leadership so feeds bury a diverse but powerful movement the removal of the leaders and the traditional political establishment. This translates into unplanned "revolts" of voters and the sudden reversal of collective mood of the last time, starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, on the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, the American members rebellion against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here). 
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value of what today in lower social strata of the West, and reinforced by the financial crisis and on dimension tied up. 
In view of all this, simply it would be excessive to talk of a "mass rebellion". 
But the eyes wide open, is however there is not.
