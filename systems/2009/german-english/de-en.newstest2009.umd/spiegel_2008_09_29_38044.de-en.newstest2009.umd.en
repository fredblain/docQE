Sylvana and the secrets of Bento box 
Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of the Tachibana should present high school, the girls to Kichern, the German is total "Kawaii"! 
What that means? 
Sylvana knows the word from gas-in the new exchange-lied told of Japan. 
"The first day in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Even before the school way I had Bam Mel. 
I live on the fringes of Tokyo in Kawasaki and go 40 minutes by train to Tachibana high school. 
The way I had to find alone, fortunately, I am not. 
The class seems Tachibana not as strictly defined as at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils tailspin from 8 p.m. until about twenty nine a brief meeting round begins with the teacher, 'home room'. 
But before the teaching began, I was in the series to me. 
I am not the type to people,, especially before a class of 40 pupils. 
because I have had no uniforms, I have an old rock my host mother attracted Bluse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes. 
So in this lift I have everything right before the plate and tried to say: 'Sayonara where she Sylvana ...' - I welcome Sylvana, come from Germany and birthday in a week. 
At the time, I was very happy that I had begun more than two years ago, to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class all Getuschelt, sniggering and Gewunken and constantly, I have heard the word "Kawaii". 
I knew from my gas. 
It is vital to vocabulary Japanese girls and means' Nice, sweet '. 
Then I am at my place Gehuscht quickly. 
The girls beside me is quite wide Gegrinst, they thought it was an honour that the exchange student sitting next to her. 
The rest of the day was relatively calm, but when the Gong chorus, I was bombarded. 
All talked about confusion and Kics tens and asked me holes in the gut-it is really difficult to understand English. Japanese 
In the break pack, then all their Bentos. 
my host mother had me as a lunchbox-that is something other than the Vapid German Pausenbrote. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, Salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. 
mostly, I have no clue what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
things look strange taste and completely original. 
What is clear is that everything is real Lecker. 
well, up to the salty lodged plum perhaps Brrrr! 
The Bentos in Japanese schools not just lunch. 
It is sometimes that a girl a young a bout Bento takes that will particularly artfully terms-in the hope that the young in the Pausensnack closer. 
I read in my Manga-comic strip. 
I am curious whether I can see here. 
' Why Japan? ", asked my friends, when I told them that I want to go to school for a year in Tokyo. 
I have always said: 
"Because I am fascinated now." 
Finally, I have read for years preferably gas. 
and so I understand the comic strip and the culture better, I have some started to learn a bit of Japan. 
I was quite clear that I eventually had to travel here. 
because I have a penchant for tradition and customs. 
and the one great value. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends on the other hand it is strictly, disciplined and traditionally. 
and because everything is so well organised, I have also not yet felt lost, even if Tokyo is the city that I have ever seen. "
