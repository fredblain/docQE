The nature of the great Flamencotänzer on the concentration and focus the interpretation, a Entspanntes as a woman or a man. 
On the one hand, artists 
On the other hand personality 
I am looking into private life, these moments, the alien for the audience, I know, when I am on the character typical gesture, the depth of being stolen or Ausdrückstärke hands, concerned, because they cannot find entrance,. 
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer Abwechselungsreiche drama some performance on the stage with singers, dancers and Gitarristen. from this side, he was little known. for artists 
With this proposal, the photographer a special Ikonografie Flamencodarstellung at different levels.

ordinary people on the portraits are artists, are in the situation on the stage passion, sadness, joy and so that the audience. 
In order to keep the personality of these artists, they do not need to photographs on the stage.

What interested me, was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to the photo camera characters of the largest Flemings COM ice of '. 
Bauer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', in 1997 on a long journey, singer, Gitaristen or dancers with a digital camera to photograph. 
Thanks to the Bildsortierungsfunktion of the camera and the existing material, images that recall classic photograph. 
The use different stylistic means destroying the traditional basis of image, which the picture of modernity and understands the idea, as flamenco: 'music, with traditional roots, the changed and surprised' every day.
