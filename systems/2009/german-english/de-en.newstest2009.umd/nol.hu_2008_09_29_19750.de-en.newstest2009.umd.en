At the end of October will determine the fate of the fallen duos Huber, Beckstein decided 
Despite the election debacle roles still no heads, the head of the Bavarian CSU was postponed the staff debates. 
Erwin Huber leader and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the only question is how long this mercy. 
The fate of the tandems after the disastrous 17 -% vote loss is on weekend at the extraordinary congress decided last October. 
The much Gescholtene duo, but says that it is not to put on their bellies. 
They want to appease the angry group and the party base, the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" with the loss of an absolute majority personal consequences. 
Five years ago-admitted, under the leadership of the height of his career, Edmund Stoiber, the Christian Social Union, 60.7 percent. But now, one year after the coup against Stoiber they were 43.4 percent of the vote. 
The CSU was 46 years' only direction "in Bavaria, the 18 percent of GDP. 
The Conservatives are the dominant force in the Hungarian economy for the important southern province, but will need to govern in a coalition. 
The first sign of party internal restructuring is the potential successors Hubers, vice-president and federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer, involved in the fact-finding team, with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "free voters" exploratory talks on a possible coalition in Munich. 
It is an irony of fate that, with the list of "free voters" those Gabriele Pauli in the legislative stone, whose anti-Stoiber the Huber, Beckstein duo exploited first, then the Abzuservieren ruthlessly determined politician.
