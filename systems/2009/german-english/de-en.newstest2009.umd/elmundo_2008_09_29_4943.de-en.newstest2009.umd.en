Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
on the ' ' emerging technology conference, of the progress, Microsoft has presented the new image recognition system and human interaction, a nature of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is able to do some primitive tasks such as a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft is this an routes planners, on the campus of the company). The system observed what it during the listening position. 
Thanks to a camera and a form-and face recognition system, the 'Rezeptionistin' see how many people are in the area, who they are and even remember, as they were held, it can listen and understand the key words their entertainment. 
It can also present after the talks in the groups. 
In a video the 'Rezeptionistin' a third person, but she understands that person to lead the group with her conversation, not belongs, and that is not a company employee. 
It asks for, whether the person wants to visit someone and says that soon they will be listening. 
All without the blue screenshot 
impressive 
This is the future. 
Now the company has better things, it can concentrate on the next version of its Windows operating system, for example. 
This week they talked very little on the change of strategy of Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be quicker and not included so many programmes. 
Steve Ballmer, said that if the computer equipped with the necessary, rather than to fill them with the commercial waste, they would be five work faster. man, Steven, this will be only for a few. 
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft Windows versions one or other function and 'extras' on. 
The shift is worth 
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing important, as well as the software. 
As Google chromium in network, this was a part of the theory that it was the first step of Google, in order to compete with Windows. 
sent many to suggest that the browser is not operating system. 
The operating system, as a vital part will always be needed to ensure that hardware and software can work. 
The operating system meets the role that compared with his wife or husband can be, when it comes to inform his mother of something. 
This is true. 
The system will never disappear, but it must be his' death ', not as an absolute, but rather as a relative truth. 
Ballmer said this week, the confirmation of this idea. 
people pay less attention every time the operating system, for the Web browser. 
The computer will only started to fire Fox, the explorer or carry out chromium and every day we spend more time on surfing, as in the vicinity of the 'window'. 
What is the half in computer existing applications? 
Less is More 
and Windows 7, compact, much more compact than Vista. 
easier, not so excessive, less complicated. 
The interest of Microsoft's is more to integrate its online services, then finally the alternative to Google. 
The reality is, without a doubt. I bring a small example. 
I took a photo of this place in red moon, in a recreational spaces for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. 
attached to the soft drinks machine is a shield: 'your search. Our future'. It prints a request from their own tools for online search. 
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66 percent of employees at Microsoft, Google for the research on the network. 
Moreover, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 in the delay. 
It will not initially, but at the end of 2009, more even 2010. 
Microsoft looks the possibility, Windows 7, and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time on the mark. 
Every day turned the phone in a computer. 
The Android and the Iphon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
