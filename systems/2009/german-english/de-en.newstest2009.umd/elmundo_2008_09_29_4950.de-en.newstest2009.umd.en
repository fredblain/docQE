for the Olympic Games are the streets in Madrid flawed. 
Yes, the dream of many of us, some Olympic disciplines to organise in Madrid, following the failure of 2012, there is perhaps 2016. 
But I wonder: 'We are prepared for this?' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old road, I would say that it is not true! 
It was described as the perfect road, and in my opinion, it was the worst road with all and off it. 
That is a lot of nonsense, of course, if the assessment would respect and I could examine it, would be so clearly. 
But, we are all from the outset. 
The nonsense begins with the ticket over that allows you to go first. 
It seems to me not bad, but if you have you do, then you should you everything (including chip, in order to avoid the congestion on the road). 
But that is not so. 
Here you get only the ticket (the first nonsense, which consists of only then) and (after an endless queues) there is the surprise, the T-shirt was only in size 's' (a second nonsense because I need size XL) 
where we actually live? 
Or is it that after the crisis was only small, much cheaper to buy shirts from less fuel? 
well, matters like these are a small in comparison to the days on the road. 
Apart from the fact that we need to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, left the rucksack. must be 
The wait has more than 35 minutes long, as in the case of a street, where 11,000 people expected, is incomprehensible. 
Finally, as it was to be expected, the streets and we had our Rücksäcke not left, even if it was even managed back, but it would be difficult. 
It was, in these 40 minutes waiting for rain, so it came to the temptation to organise a popular uprising and was excited about. 
I think tomorrow will certainly some 500 people have pneumonia and some as I because this chip, I have, not even time for the classification, I can think of is that the outcome was wrongly labelled. 
of course, if you ask me for a perfect road, this road would never come. 
so I think that we are still long dream of a city that is prepared for the Olympic Games
