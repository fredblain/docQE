A well-known American politicians, which is keen to be seen as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama, the second anti-American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, with his decisions, the US economy depleted and with the Befeindeten Islam relations used (and even today as a private citizen does) ". 
The attacks on Obama will increasingly violent, now, where the elections. 
A lady in Miami, wrote in an Internet page: "this person is full of ambitions. 
Obama is very brazenly: he thinks it will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators! ". 
not much to say these attacks, however; it is racist attacks and they cannot answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; all say that Obama will win with a large margin. 
In this case, people because, with the heart and not talk to the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the election booth will we know who the real American Patriot his voice. 
This is a mentality of the US to light, until the hidden.
