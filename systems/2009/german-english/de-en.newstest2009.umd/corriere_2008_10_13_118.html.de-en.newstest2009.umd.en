The Superkleber, walls up 
to defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a Klebstoffes and climb walls high as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which is now seems to be almost reached the objective. 
with a in an area of just 2.5 Qcm disgruntled Kleber, the researchers have succeeded, a 100 kg serious body fixated on a tightening right wall. 
The studio-an American magazine, has the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force research laboratory published. 
The material devised by the team of researchers is a further development of already used glues, what a special carbon structure, called carbon-Nanoröhrchen, use. 
"The principle of Klebers can, as a number to a batch of spaghetti members present tubes", said Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists were inspired by the feet of Geckos, which are covered in microscopic's Härchen a perfect, the animal. 
with various materials like glass Teflon and abrasive paper tests have shown that the new Kleber is ten times more than the ability of the feet of reptiles and at the same time "easily can be removed from the wall," Liming Dai, researchers in the school of engineering at the University of Dayton. 
moving walls along? "the material could be used as a deciduous glue", Liming Dai. 
around as Spiderman to walls,? Perhaps, but the researchers think rather use a less fascinating, such as electrical equipment, because the Nanoröhrchen are as head of heat and electricity. 
other purposes could fall in the field of space. 
For the moment, the super-hero must wait. 
The other form of research, including the University of Berkeley, California, to a new Kleberart. 
In an article in the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists a glue from micro-fibres such as hair movement on a surface clean even the dust and it always a perfect liability.
