"We are not trying to talk about their lives, special to maintain their Esprit," said the Flamencotänzerin. 
their dance bases have helped me much Flamenco. 
'The Dance of the butterfly' I, for example, as Guajira, or 'the dance the snake' as tango. 
their dance was sense, and I have been told that my dance in this aesthetic is', it claims. 
The performance with two exceptional work: with Miguel Poveda, the time for Isabel when their ideas Sing, as it did in 'La Puerta Abierta'; and Flamenco-champion, Matilde Corral, who once wanted to work together with their ex-schoolchildren. 
"Matilde Tórtola, plays a very mature personality. 
I am happy, because they had agreed to help my work, and I feel very honoured.' 
The piece also with musical composition and Gitaristen Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón, percussion from El Pájaro, and the Viola of Rafa Viola and cooperation with the actor Juan Franglais Júarez, 'is the role of the aid of artists, the divas were, in which he always love.'
