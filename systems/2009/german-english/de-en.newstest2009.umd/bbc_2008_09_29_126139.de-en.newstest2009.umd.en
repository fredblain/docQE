BSkyB ITV loses appeal in the case. 
BSkyB has his appeal against the decision by the Competition Commission, to reduce its share of the competing station ITV, lost. 
The competition appeal court has imposed BSkyB, his participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%. 
The commission had already said that the share Bskybs distorts competition and allowed it unfair influence on the channel ITV. 
BSkyB acquired its share in 2006, NTL, now renamed Virgin media, has successfully prevented the purchase of ITV. 
in April 2007, the competition authority reported that the purchase of the stake in ITV by BSkyB have doubts about the independence of the ITV, which has persuaded the Competition Commission to launch an investigation. 
The Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communications office Ofcom have opposed the purchase. 
BSkyB argued that the pressure to reduce its stake in ITV, is an unreasonable and excessive measure, especially since BSkyB announced, to abandon its voting rights.
