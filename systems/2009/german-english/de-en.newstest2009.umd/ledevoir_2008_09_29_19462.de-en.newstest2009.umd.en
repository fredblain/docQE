Free-the Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold 
in its edition on 17 September Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, deputy director-general of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine gold. 
This confirmed, and in an Orwellian logic that the world's biggest gold profits of society a libel case over six million against three authors and a small Mittelloses publishing house, with the aim to open a public transparent debate. 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then you are not on the truth, particularly in the case of defamation complaints, but about the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed from Mr Garver. 
Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, everybody in the ruin who dares to one of the opinions of their opposite. 
However, as the process, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defence and very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight to be paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. 
The tactic of this unequal fight is also often, ruining the defenders, in order to force an amicable settlement, the silence the other side and also discourage any who dares to look again at the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public debate, she would have must present their view of things before the public opinion. 
In contrast, what works in many of the countries where Barrick Gold, and there is in Canada debates normally through the exchange of ideas, not Kn√ºppelhiebe fought. 
So there would have been enough, if the gold mine open its books and files and would open a real debate, by the newspapers, media, publishing and financing independent audit team, bring the light in this issue. 
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in the public opinion and can the petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada aside with a hand. 
could Mr Garver explain how he can also ask for a public debate, but the views of this public scorn? 
Apparently the word in the world of vice-president the generous paid lawyers, and not the community all Canadians; a very good Beengte view of the term. 
In a democracy is the right to speak. Even slanderers 
Barrick Gold does not understand or does not wish to understand, is that the public that the authors and publisher of Noir Canada supports this especially because they oppose the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and judgments, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework, the commission gave many-action (during the 'consequently debate, Barrick Gold has sent a request to the authors of Noir Canada, they asked, not to use this term ...). 
Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, the case of Barrick Gold a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth, the fundamental for any democratic society. 
It denies totally right, credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations, which form the basis of the intellectual. 
If it is impossible in a country such as Canada, to discuss issues to investigate and, not like the rich in the world, who else can do? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public and open debate, could this lead by the scientific standards, the authors of Noir Canada have been used. 
It has a right to respond. 
The university environment we belong, has long known, debates and inconsistencies in the control and to resolve conflicts. 
the disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold shows that, contrary to what they claim, has no desire for an open debate. 
This is a loss for the university world, as it was for the public debate, and it is time that governments take measures to limit this type of unjustified actions.
