believers have less pain? 
as recent research has shown that the religious believe as a kind of "pain" effect that should already have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs. 
The Oxford University scientists have an interesting experiment: it was investigating whether the belief in God the feeling pain of the people affected, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph". 
In the wake of the rather bizarre investigation ever received 12 believers and atheists electric shocks, while they studied a painting of the Mother of God. 
As the results showed, the believers could switch off most of the pain. 
Using a brain-scan technology could even be shown that Catholics could activate the part of your brain, which is responsible for the pain regulation. 
The investigation was the first in a research project, as well as scientists, philosophers and theologians of various departments in the university. 
The attempt was linked the subjects Funkelndes machine on the left hand, which the electric shocks. 
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: a picture of the Mother of God, painted of Sassoferrato, in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vincis "lady with the Hermelin". 
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the believers would create a kind of religious trance, while you select Vincis picture, because it is not much different from other paintings and reassuring. 
The subjects spent the half an hour in an MRI scanner, and a total of 20 electric shocks, this time in four stages, while they either religious or other paintings should look. 
The Catholics reported that they had at the sight of the Mother of God "in safety" felt as if they "for" and had "calm and peace". 
During the Betrachtens religious painting you have about 12% less pain than if they Leonardos work. 
The psychologist Miguel far IAS, also attended the attempt, said, similar effects could also working with other strong images among atheists, we should also find just the photo. 
"We must find a picture, the very positive sentiments, such as a mother or father", the psychologist. 
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
"The practice of the faith should change our personality, and in many cases it does," Wright. 
These excellent results, only the question of what effect a Madonna-picture Leonardos or other similar Malers on the pain regulation of believers.
