The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, in a city of special kind 
hidden between the excesses of leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles from the flashy, noisy and gigantic drive, is a quiet city in the pride and come to light the complications of African-American culture. 
Eaton), the first completely black city in the country and the city Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer so easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, Brown hides, 300 good swimmers do, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." 
It is a pilgrimage site. 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee to the annual Zora! festival in Eaton) come to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem renaissance. 
and yet and is the city that it describes-and to a tourist outing goal made by them in the Florida tour of the periods of depression by the Federal writers' project has been produced-in many ways a place of particular variety. 
Eaton) is so independent, sound and private as in the 1930s, Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share, their real thoughts with the Sen man, "so little about US, that he is not, what escapes him." 
Even today, in a year in which a black president Schaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama, call for an open dialogue on race relations, many are still suffering from Aussenseitern observed. 
"We are very anxious as our history told," Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to residents of the city and local member of the oldest church in the city. 
It must vote. " 
Eaton) have long been defined as paradox of triumph and the fight. 
It is both a historic example of the black movement as a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
It is a stronghold of literature and an example of the sometimes, sometimes touted-black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that the residents here are both proud and wary. 
and so began the concerns about Eaton Ville's image with Zora, as all Hurston here. 
It was the world their home town in books, which were written by heart, and mouth kind, as "mules and men" (1953) and "their eyes were watching God" (1973). 
five paragraphs in the Florida trip leaders modified the city, which is close to the route 77, a road by the often-forgotten centre of Florida, scene of black history and human tragedy. 
use as Oskar both in real life and in the literature, Hurston readers to the shop of Eatonvilles first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then more private affairs. wrote 
"off the roads on the left", she wrote, "The Brown-Weiss Angestrichene modern school, with its leafy gardens and jobs, which always Howard Miller, although he cannot read and write." 
They also mentioned the new man of widow dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "drinks sold any kind and what-also-always hours rooms." 
in only a few hundred words, Hurston Eaton) associated with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was certainly not a tour guide. 
In fact, this was not a portrait that has been appreciated by everyone. 
"Zora described the things as they were," the 90-year-old Ella Dink into one of the Johnson girls the Hurston Verewigte, quoted by the men, the songs on its beauty sang with sexual innuendo. 
She added: "Some people disliked it." 
It is still remember Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin Regelmässig returned, after her family, Jackson), Florida, was withdrawn. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, said that if Hurston in the city Gebraust came, they usually without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoke and in trousers, in a city even today is something its venerable dress convinced. 
According to Mr Franklin were the most fascinated people, whereas many despise. 
"People were always glad to see Zora", Mr Franklin said. 
But "you never too long", he added Schaukelte while in his chair, situated on a back terrace on the Sabelia sea, in the Hurston in all likelihood was baptized. 
When Hurston died in 1960 it was poor and abusing its books. 
together with the bulk of the world seemed to have Eaton) you forget. 
Although it was a famous author, a tin Zeitgenössin Lang Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard college in the 1920ern, was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they lived, buried in an unmarked grave. 
In Eaton), there was no major commemoration, no public readings in the large-scale. 
"I do not think that your contribution in the world or their heritage in the slightest understood," Valerie Boyd, author of "wrapped in rainbows", a biography of Hurston was published in 2003. 
The turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted a five-lane motorway through the city, in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, slow two main street in the community. 
Orlandos suburbs had already pushed the motorway 4 by the western outskirts of town. 
The proposal was made, as Eaton) were still recovering from a difficult period in its history. 
forced integration, among other things, the relatively idyllic isolation of the community an end. 
In the 1950s, the fight against racial hatred in the community. 
"In this time was often a bunch of white boys and they threw oranges and toys on the sidelines seat people", said Mr Franklin. 
"There was even a woman who was killed. 
They threw a water melon from the car. " 
In 1955, Hurston asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the requirement of the Supreme Court to force integration, by the decision in the case of Brown versus the school Council as "insulting my race Respektierend". 
Today, residents say that although the lifting of racial segregation was positive in many ways, the groups cohesion in Eaton) and the self-awareness of its young people weakened. 
"black children were there used to be embraced-I remember-we embrace his teachers in the morning and we embrace his teachers at night" so N. so Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dink and executive director of the nonprofit group for the protection of Eaton) community. 
This could be maintained so long, they added, until teachers and pupils no longer came from the same place. 
"We embrace his white teachers not because he was a white teacher-I mean, there is a cultural gap", said Mrs Nathiri. 
But the citizens' rights helped that room for further Zora Neale Hurstons was created-black writers, actors and artists who flout prejudices, as it did, with positive self-awareness and statements such as: "How can someone the pleasure I refuse society! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975, the author Alice Walker on the way to Hurstons anonymous grave and began to revive their glory. 
Five years later was a much praised Hurston-biography of Robert E. Hemenway shelves in the books, and made it to a part of the American Literaturkanons again. 
The roads project was at a time in the Eatonvilles famous daughter once again in the light of public opinion. 
And this time, Hurstons old neighbours as Retterin. 
The city began in 1988 with the planning a Hurston festivals to show what the county with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January return many of the celebration. 
A few years later, the area of its road construction plans. 
"The plans a Fünfspurigen in crowded the city, accelerated the whole top speed, gave real citizens proud", said Mrs Nathiri. 
Mrs Boyd put it somewhat easier: "Zora saved Eaton)." 
The victory against the roads project has helped change the image of the city. 
There were more and more traveled, as RAC bright Munson, a lawyer, since 1993 here in the Church, and local began the past New. 
Eaton) in the 1998 national historic register. 
A new Einstöckige library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 at the Neugepflasterten and Verschönerten Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today, Eaton) is still a special in Florida: just 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos can sometimes Anfühlen as an alleyway in summer, as little as was the only 27 black families in the 1880ern was founded. 
(It is currently 90% black.) 
outsiders in the search for the history Eatonvilles and its importance still often treated with caution. 
For most interviews a prior approval is necessary and certain things-as the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles eldest church, which was painted by a Wei ice and black men in the field work-must not be photographed. 
Many in Eaton), as Mrs Jones, a bold, confident teacher with a penchant for dark red, still fear that their secretive community misunderstood. 
And yet, at the same time to the greater the Hurston festival was born, was also a greater degree of homeland pride. 
Young people in particular tend to see, Eaton) such as Hurston their entire race saw: beautiful, with all its problems, either worse or better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America. 
It is the genuine love of this city in the voice of Mr Franklin nephew can hear, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, intends to return to Eaton) to work in the city government or the police, according to the aid could use him anything. 
and even the younger, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from winter Park, have learned, Eaton) right to describe. 
"Most people who only to drive here, will think: "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the other", said Alondra Kenon recently after the church on Sunday. 
"But if you actually stop and a moment his history, it is a very beautiful city."
