In this edition of "discuss education watch, Bruce fuller and Lance T. Izumi the positions of the candidates for the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, chief scientific staff in Kalifonischen studies and senior director in the Department of Education sciences in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, a co-author of the book "is not as good as we think: Why the middle class needs a school choice". 
The Hispanic voters is a complex task. 
Bar rack Obama's proposals on the subject of education are a typical example. 
Obama's campaign said that "the likelihood of African-American and Hispanic students to successfully conclude the school is lower than for White pupils' - which is true. 
In order to close the performance gap, recommends Obama's education plan specifically in a bilingual transitional phase in training for those who learn English only. 
Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether its use for the bilingual education, focused on teaching in languages other than English, his interest, to reduce the gap in performance at school. 
take as example "Sixth Street preparatory conference", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles. 
The majority of pupils are his panic and come from families with low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many of whom are only recently in the country, learn English. 
But in 2008 amazing 100 percent pupils of the fourth class the state testing in math at a good level. 
also surprising, 93 percent of children from the fourth school in the English test as well. 
The astonishing success was achieved with other methods, as those who preferred Obama. 
The school sixth Street, its focus on exercise, constant monitoring of knowledge and an attitude that tolerated no exceptions. 
Finally, practice the school approach, after a training in the English-speaking environment. This is the point that Obama should note, the school administrator Linda Mikels. 
This approach attaches importance to the almost Ausschliesslichen use of the English language for teaching. 
Mrs Mikels, rejects the idea of bilingual education, said, the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil, only about from Mexico. 12 months later would enter school and do not see again. 
"It works", noted, "It works for us". 
would Obama a school as the "sixth Street preparatory conference" as a model for other schools with great share of Latin American and other English learners pupils? 
The performance of the school would make the answer to this question easily, but the educational positions within his own party (the National picture UNSG associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions on Obama's answer is uncertain. 
While he supports the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue, when he said that people should stop, worried about the "English only" gathering legislation. 
Instead, he said: "They should make sure that their child can Spanish." 
If Obama wants to close the gap in performance, he carefully educational models, the work, rather than to despise and trivialize.
