Duel on a knife edge: MP3 player against mobile phone. 
We advise you on your election 
While it can be played almost every phone, MP3 files to telephone or any MP3 player. 
It is of course true that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
Despite all of this there are enough reasons why we should establish an independent player. 
The whole election depends on the type of use and the demands of the future owners. 
Sure you buy hear is difficult for home a fancy expensive record player, is the latest album from Maxim turbulenc. 
Once such musical substance not appearing on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason. 
However, they have LPs with kind of rock, jazz and blues on the shelf, she dreams probably at least one of them. 
It is also expressed with the musicians on tour, simplified with compressed music - music in the MP3 format. 
Here, too, there are price and quality category. 
For one thing, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player eight thousand kroner, just a Pinker Floyd fan will withstand but difficult headphones for twenty crown from the market. 
Two extremes, between whom there is enough room for everyone. 
The selection is vast. 
The life of the battery is crucial. 
Some good music players can take a lot more than just music, but what can they create mobile not even hints. 
No modern equipment is up as universal as the telephone. 
Apart from the primary functions, the telephone calls and the Sims, can again be music and video, both begin, it has a better, sometimes for worse camera and can navigate perhaps too. 
And if you include the smart Phon and communicators about all portfolios, it was almost a small computer in the bag. 
It is a minor miracle, because none of the fridge can grilled and photographed, no television. 
But the universality of mobile phones would also bring disadvantages. 
The more functions on her mobile phone use, the more often you will need it but to shop. 
And the place of music is one of the largest energy eaters. 
Only a few mobile music can be played more than ten of twelve hours, most of the time, it is much less. 
In this respect, music player (especially the simplest) are much more efficient. 
That is why they should count on the cheap mobile phones so that they can take no more than a few hours of music. 
If they are to make a telephone call and they buy on security still prefer to invite equipment for office - and this applies to more expensive equipment. 
With MP3 players they will not have these problems, including the less good for keeping at least 9 hours of continuous plant with a time loading. 
Another problem is that if you want to play the music on mobile phones. 
Unfortunately, only a fraction of the equipment has a USB conclusion, also does not join any cell phones with special software directly to a PC. 
Of course, you may be able to play the music directly on a storage medium, but only a handful of card readers will be without reductions with the tiny smartcard, which are used in mobile phones. 
When players they need to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
They need to feed the device only via USB port with music from your PC. 
Most mobile phones and player to determine a music libraries, ordered after the name of performers, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the assessment made by users. 
Some devices are only form the tree structure of the address directories, similar to the windows Explorer, some of them both (iRiver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
Players are using mobile phones can more easily, 
In selecting a specific equipment they need, particularly after the lifespan of artificial, the storage capacity, the quality and type of music back and, of course, also the official comfort. 
For them music is above all aid and they hear it every day, just briefly, for example in the trams, then a random phone, as MP3 files. 
What really almost every cell phones can. 
They must not too much control, what music formats, a mobile phone or a player can deal with. 
MP3 all create, and, most of the music, which you receive is precisely in this format. 
The format is one of the most common and most of the equipment can also be played music in WMA format. 
Less customary is a (AAC format that Apple and its iPod use). 
Better enable mobile phones also buying music online. 
One need only look at the relevant page a mobile Internet service providers (or any other service providers), and you can buy a song or album. 
This service may be in and of itself a forceful argument for why we should establish a music phones. 
Unfortunately, the supply of providers is bad, and usually only to quickly radio hits. 
The price is also not the lowest. 
In general, however, assuming that this type of selling music was dominate (it on GSM, Internet and wireless Internet) in the music industry. 
Most of the cell phone in. 
If you have the inclination to listen to something, you pick up the phone in the jacket pocket, while the player forgotten at home. 
It is important, however, is whether they wear whatever headphones, or at least a wireless free telephone facilities. 
If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeaker that almost any cell phones, but only a few mp3 player. 
Probably the biggest benefit of the music phones will be for many in the price. 
The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand kroner. 
For three and four thousand kroner they get quite a decent issue. 
The biggest handicap most people will find that are not normal headphones. 
The best technical and appeared ready to test phone with a 3.5 mm opening for standard headphones cost up to five, ten thousand kroner. 
The advantage of the player is the easy restaurant. 
The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really any dip. 
A minimum of functions, the similarities in the restaurant with the former normal cassette recorder or, for example, the dull game is obvious. 
There is no collision in the form of a mistaken employees mobile Internet and a subsequent exorbitant bill for data transmission. 
Following what devices you should take effect now 
Even the cheapest mobile phone (such as Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchange of storage media (type M2 MicroSD, etc.). 
Also, if you buy a ticket, two thousand kroner enough. 
But beware. 
The base model only tickets are generally supported with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the costliest can read 8 GB memory card. 
If you already have a mobile phone, and even if there is a cheap mp3 players want to buy, they apply after, Cowon Creativ, Sony, Samsung, iRiver emgeton or. 
According to their capacity (Max) 2 GB must not put these things more than 1100 kronor on the table. 
They are among the more demanding headphones, you prefer specialised cell phone speakers - mans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have separate official buttons for MP3, and the official comfort is so to an individual MP3 players. 
Most Sony Ericsson, whose cell phone from the succession issue the same user interface, like the sold individually is MP3 player. 
The same services at the same price category of up to four thousand kroner, but with increased storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long artificial life (usually 15 hours, maximum of up to 35 hours) make your MP3 player of the above-mentioned manufacturers.
