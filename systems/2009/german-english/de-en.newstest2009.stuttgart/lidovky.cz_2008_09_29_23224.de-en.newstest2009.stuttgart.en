The Sudeten calls by the United States a plebiscite 
The Sudeten Germans had requested in 1945 at the affiliation of Böhmer forest to the United States. 
This fact emerges from a letter superimposed over the collection of südböhmischen scientific libraries. 
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, so we would like to live at least under the aegis of the United States of America. 
With such a desire in 1945 should have turned some groups of Sudeten Germans to US president. 
This is evident from a letter that has received remained in a private archive and will be retained for now in the collection of the südböhmischen scientific libraries. 
The Germans from krumau request in a letter to the American president that he should not allow the return of the "Sudeten Gaus" - which was adopted on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler, Czechoslovakia. 
"We have understood the position correctly and enter the words we really do want to be sure that the American unit not oppressors and enemy German territory, but as liberators", says in a letter, which is signed with the word 'people to whom fate of the Sudeten dear ". 
Since the end of Czechoslovakia would suggests the Sudeten Germans, in full knowledge of the Czech national nature - that they expect brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the author of the letter asking the American president to play for today and forever the protection dominion over the Böhmer forest. 
"We do not believe that it has granted without regard to the views of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this territory to US foreign state which seeks oppressed minorities and to eliminate and done nothing for the victory of the Allied", is to read the letter. 
The reason why the author cannot sign is supposedly the fear of revenge "Czech oppressors." 
The US president had doubts about the affiliation of Böhmer forest German, it is sufficient if he would instigate böhmerwaldgau in a referendum over whether residents want to be part of the United States or life protection under the domination of the United States. 
Although the text of the letter may sound in today's knowledge of the post-war history a little naïve, he signed but according to some witnesses a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans. 
Even if the Bohemian Germans had guessed at the very least, that they would renegotiate their removal from the Republic, few of them conceded only one such option at all. 
Some waited for the United States and Britain for the Sudetenland would negotiate a kind of autonomy. 
Others believed that they could well remain simple in Czechoslovakia. 
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav chalupa originating from Budweis. 
It was used in the war as Budweiser German in the Navy in the Baltic. 
When he came at the end of the war in British captivity and him in a prisoner of war camp in Schleswig-Holstein, they took dozens killed more Bohemian Germans to him to teach them Czech. 
"They believe if they come home, they would come to the Czech passport," chalupa. 
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia expects his view that it would sell it on the basis of the Benes decrees from the Republic.
