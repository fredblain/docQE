If the energy springs from the waves, the large to run the sudden 
It is not a versiegende money source, which covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and it is only now that seem to understand the large energy companies in the world. 
Wave, tidal currents and the new renewable energy sources are looking to the now all and to occupy also seek, Chevron around giants like. 
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movement of the sea will be held for the past 70 years might be considered and studied; it is no coincidence that this study has intensified since the first oil crisis. 
As the price of oil by 1980 it crumbled Vergas the idea of marine energy, but now the environmental organisations and the rise in oil prices to new impetus in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London, estimates that 15% of the world's energy needs could be met by the ocean wave energy produced. 
This would be double the same now through nuclear power plants producing energy. 
The currents and tides added. 
Giants with the attack. 
The first company that is now on the marine energy Enersis, who has signed a contract in 2005 to build a power station in the north of Portugal. 
When the news was published it seemed to be a revolutionary step. 
Two years later, there are now more and more companies in the traditional energy sector who rely on marine energy. 
"Chevron investigated these technologies", the spokesperson for the American giants big-name companies in the Wall Street Journal - and w√§gt together the possibility is with us. " 
We are concerned here with the creation of an authorisation from the American Energy Commission, which is needed to launch a project off the coast of Alaska. 
This is an unmistakable signal, particularly given that oil in Alaska still encouraged by the United States and, more recently, the plans for new drilling in President Bush. 
In addition to Chevron also firms Verdant Power, Inc., is from New York and oceans power from New Jersey who invest in new sectors of industry; the details are not well known, such observers talk but by a rising interest. 
Yet improved technologies. 
Experts speak of a further shift in the throes of technology, not least because it is not the last question from the environmentalists are resolved. 
Now projects such as those in Portugal and also in Scotland are rather small scale and there seems no serious environmental problems to cause. 
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, we need technology with far greater impact on the environment. 
There are various possibilities: oceans power around using a system of interlinked observation buoys. 
The surge of waves, whatever the observation buoys and moved on, will be transformed within the swimmer on butts Zylinder and in hydraulic pressure. 
That drives a turbine technology, which is in turn a generator. 
The electricity is sent out on underwater pipelines to the coast. 
Until now, there are four planned facility of this kind, which are waiting for the government approval. A portion of the electricity generated could also be used for military installations. 
Verdant Power produced but already energy goods for a department store and a park Latz using undersea and turbines in the East River of New York. 
The movement of water during the tides of pushing the turbines, which fed by the burgeoning town movement the generators. 
According to the verdant has been waiting a long queue of potential clients on the necessary authorization to tap these sources. 
The first wave, then the tides. 
A special interest earned, according to the Institute for energy production research in an instant the potential inherent in the tides. 
Although this is a difficult phenomenon, tides are more predictable than the wind currents, the sun and the waves, and therefore a more reliable source of power generation. 
It is precisely the tidal energy is what brought federal states such as New York, mainstreaming and Alaska and other coastal states to invest already 7.5 million dollars in 2008 - for 2009 already up to 35 million are planned.
