Intelligent Car copied the flight of the Hummel 
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to accident prevention, if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature? 
For example, the bees. 
At the CEATEC Japan in an astonishing project were presented, in which the Nissan engineers by Hummel was inspired in the creation of new accident irresistible follows system. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University Nissan has built the car robots controlled biomimetische system from type br23c, a mini car, equipped with the characteristics of the bee, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that prevents any collision. 
The flight each bee formed their own oval "private sector", which is our own "shield" very similar kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, the exhibition said. 
The buzz, the eye of the bee that can see in every direction and in a corner of over 300 degrees game play an important role in this. 
The function of the compound, the researchers on replicating the idea of the laser guided distance knife. 
It identifies obstacles before br23c in a face field of 180 degrees within 2 metres, its removal calculated and sends signals to the micro prozessor on board, who started immediately the collision vermeidenden process. 
The barrier will be registered in a split second, and the robot instantly change the course, similar to the movement of bees when he turned the tires at the proper perspective. 
Unlike previous system these maneuvers will take place purely instinctively. 
"If it were not so, the car robots could react fast enough to avoid the obstacles', Toshiyuki Andoh, director of" hullaballoo laboratory "and the car robot project said. 
The system must instinctive and immediately react, since this technology corresponds to the innermost part and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer of accidents are currently still considered unavoidable. 
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of others if they avoid other bees. 
And this should be done in a split second. 
However, the Dodge, unlike the bees, not going up, down, or even diagonal - there can be only two dimensions, and only in the direction of wendbarkeit of tyres. 
While there are evading the bee here endless possibilities open to other bees, the researchers could use the robot car only the movement, or, indeed, the acceleration and deceleration. 
The br23c contains lithium polymer batteries which are light and energy efficient, and therefore have a longer life than traditional lithium batteries illuminated. 
Andoh stated, it is the instinctive, intelligent responses, and less on the processing of data, and still less on the ability to retain this. 
These devices must per second process only a few inputs and respond to them. 
It must retain this, or produce from previous exercises an intuitive, logical reaction, just a handful of KB memory so it constantly on the increase. 
There is no gigabits and megabyte hard memories. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which will be rated by Nissan within the next ten years standard in production. 
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation, since it draws the motorists' awareness about obstacles around and it leads as the target.
