Obscure road into town to sell often forgotten and possibly soon 
New York City thousands of main roads, all, side streets and other bypass has what some famous and others are self-indulgent. 
But is it even for experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals hard to tell where there is extraterrestrial Mr des Places, simply because most of them have never heard about. 
This tiny Street in the East Village and runs from the first North Street between the Bowery and Second Avenue, without achieving the second Street. 
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alleyway as after an active used by waterways. 
There is also no road signs. 
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map. 
This road has nevertheless her admirer. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that has built recently wealthy building on First Street. 
It wants extra place plaster, to create a safe passage to the shops and boutique, which are expected in the new building. 
Among the other respecter of the long-standing neighbourhood, says that she was fascinated by the short alleyway, simply because it is one of the remnants of the past of the block. 
But the city government Department for protection and the construction of housing authority and is responsible for the road has no interest in order to preserve it. 
During a meeting of the Committee for land use on the Municipal Council this month, representatives from the City Council and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road through the construction company. 
However, favored the committees that the roads in the hands of the city remains, and has asked for a new plan that should be presented next month, Susan Stetzer, the district, the councillor responsible 3. 
"There is very little space has remained in the ownership of the city and we would like to see extra place to remain part of the city," she said. 
"It could be offered as they repaired the roads and what could be done by Avalon, but we also want to see the public access is guaranteed." 
Avalon Bay has announced several months ago, plasters the small streets and install new seats, which are intended for, amongst other things, a caf√©, in which the company would lease space. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the streets were made for the first time during the sessions this month publicly. 
Michel de Milly, a spokeswoman at the Avalon Bay said that the company wanted to use the road, she did not want to do it, but I think it is vital. 
"The main purpose of the Avalon Bay is there to Reno four these dilapidated alleyway and make a public venue", she said, and added that the city itself had proposed the sale. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department for building protection said it was actually the desire of the city to sell the streets and stressed that the task of the Institute is to develop more properties than to administer. 
Compared with his mixed neighborhood the Bowery, extras and little has maintained its historic impression. 
Some people think that the streets has gotten her name in the year 1802 when a large farms, Philip mint Horn, divided between his numerous children and claimed a narrow strip of any country. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, carries Rock memorial that was closed in 2006, opens the extra place and the road is most familiar as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "rocket to Russia 'by Ramon. 
The plaster was magnificent, Danny field, the managers of the Ramon, who had made the photo in November 1976 said. 
The streets were full of scrap metal, shackles and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and cable. 
For some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrifizierung of East Village have rejected the idea of selling extra place, arguing that such public land, to be as modest as it is still open to the public. 
Others have sold extras place than a rarity - a virtually unchanged cluster of the city that should be left in peace. 
Jeremiah, Moss, the blog name "Jeremiah vanishing New York" runs (one has the headline "The Book of complaints: a bitter nostalgic look at the crumbling city") has published a part of the conversation, the city stories about extraterrestrial place that appeared in the magazine 'the New York "in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill wrote: "special place is a small narrow alley, which remains even during the day, dark and through corroded metal door of the warehouse, closed window and suggest women over soaring weeks old newspapers marked". 
With a few exceptions, the road looked just as recently in one evening. 
A rat ran through the back part of the street, not far from the door that led to the former CBGB, where an expensive clothes shops finds itself today. 
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the ground, not far from a fresh set of discarded newspapers. 
Some shoppers said she would have considered rare about extraterrestrial Mr des Places, but suggested that the road could be gloss. 
That field added that some people underestimate for his opinion, the lure of the road in their current state. 
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
