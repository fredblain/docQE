The pride and the consequent fatigue in the life of the black population, in a town of quite particular type 
Hidden among the excesses of leisure park within a radius of Orlando, a few miles from the glitzernden, noisy and gigantic drive away is a quiet town where the pride and the complications of African-American culture come to the fore. 
Eaton Louisville, the first true entirely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neal hurstons, description is not as simple as Hurston in 1935: "The town with five lakes, three krocketplätzen, 300 Brown hide, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no jail." 
Nowadays it is a pilgrimage site. 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee at the annual Zora! festival in Eaton Louisville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And yet it was and the city that describes you - and you have made to a tourist outing goal by acquired it in the Florida trip leader who has been produced during the Depression, the Federal Writers' Project - remains in many ways a site of special varieties. 
Eaton Louisville is so independent, dignified and private as in the 1930's when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida refused, often to share your true thoughts with the white man who knows "so few of us that he does not know what escapes him." 
Even now, a year from now, a black presidential kanditat, Senator Barack Obama, in a frank conversation about race relations in the call, there are many people here still suffering to be seen by outsiders. 
"We are very anxious as telling our story," Jones hortens, 59, from birth, a resident of the town and the local member of the city's oldest churches. 
It must be true. " 
Eaton Louisville was defined a long time as a paradox of triumph and the fight. 
There is one historical example of the black movement as a community of nearly 2.400 residents where the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
On the one hand it is a stronghold of literature and on the other hand, is an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes vaunted - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery. 
It is not surprising that people here both pride than were also on the alert. 
And so the doubts at Eaton Louisville 's image began with Zora Hurston, as all here. 
It presents the world their hometown in books, who died of heart and written in dialect of goods, such as "Mule and Men" (1953) and "portrayed Your Eyes were Watching God" (1973). 
Five paragraphs in the Florida tour guide to the city, which is quite near the route 77 modified, a road leading through the often forgotten centre Florida to the scene of black history and human tragedy. 
Smart as Oskar both in real life as in the literature, Hurston reader led to the shop by Eaton Louisville first mayor, Joe Clark, and turned to then privater affairs. 
"Aside from the roads to the left," she wrote, "is the Brown white angestrichen modern schools, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, the cares and Howard Miller, although he can barely read and write." 
She also mentioned the new man of widows dash and wrote that Lee fits Glenn "drinks of any kind and sold whatever to hours rooms." 
In only a few hundred words Hurston expressed so Eaton Louisville with even governments, but also of illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was certainly not a tour guide. 
In fact, this was not a portrait that has been appreciated by all. 
"Zora describing things as they were," the 90 Pittella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls immortalized the Hurston by quoted the men, sang the songs on its beauty, which were full of sexual innuendo. 
She added: "Some people didn't." 
They remember here still hurtson than a lively exzentrik Londoner who returned on a regular basis, after their families was withdrawn after Jackson Louisville, Florida. 
Franklin, Augustus, 77, remembers that Hurston came when the city gebr oyster, it usually without warning she did, in a noisy, Chevrolet rauchend and with trousers, dressed in a city which even today is somewhat on its venerable clothing style holds. 
According to Mr Franklin most residents were fascinated, whereas many despise them. 
"People were always glad to see Zora", Mr Franklin said. 
But "she was never too long," he added as he schaukelt in his chair, christening on a backfire handily patio that looks at the sabelia sea where Hurston, in all likelihood. 
As Hurston died in 1960 it was poor and their books vergriffen. 
Along with the majority of the world's Eaton Louisville seemed to have forgotten them. 
Though she was once a famous author, a zeitgenössin langstin Hughes and the only black women at Barnard College in the 1920ern, they were in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they lived, buried in an unmarked grave. 
In Eaton Louisville, there was no major commemoration, no public reading in high style. 
"I don't think that you have understood your contribution in the world or their heritage in the slightest," published in 2003 as Valerie Boyden, author of "wrapped in rainbow," a biography of Hurston. 
The turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street in the borough. 
Orlando suburb had already called the motorway 4 through the western edge of town. 
The proposal was presented as Eaton Louisville still recovered from a difficult phase in its history. 
Compulsory integration, among other things, the relatively idyllic isolation of the communities were brought to an end. 
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing hatred expressed in the community. 
"In this time was often a bunch of white boys and they threw oranges and stuff on the sidelines sitters people," Mr. Franklin said. 
"There was even a woman who was killed. 
They threw a water melon of a car. " 
In 1955 Hurston questioned having it in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the demands of the Supreme Court, integration, baptising his decision in Brown against the schulrat as "insulting instead of my race respektierend." 
Residents say nowadays that weakens although the lifting of racial segregation was in some respects positive, the groups cohesion in Eaton Louisville and self-assurance its young people. 
"black children were grown accustomed to be embraced - I recall - it embraced his teachers in the morning and they embraced his teacher at night", N. Y. nathiri, daughter of Pittella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit groups to protect the Eaton Louisville communities. 
This could be so long maintained, she added, by teachers and pupils came not from the same place. 
"They embraced his white teachers, not because he is a white teacher - I was there is a cultural gap existing," said Mrs nathiri said. 
However, the rights of citizens who have helped to ensure that Neal hurstons has room for further Zora created - black writers, actors and artists who flouts prejudices, as it did, with positive self-esteem and statements such as: "How anyone can disagree with the pleasure of my company. 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975, the novelist Alice Walker, based on the way to hurstons anonymous graves and began struggling to revive their fame. 
Five years later, a much-vaunted Hurston biography of Robert E. was finding Hemenway in the bookshelf, and makes you once again to a part of American literary canon. 
The highway project came exactly at a time, in the Eaton Louisville famous daughter was again in the clear light of day. 
And this time hurstons old neighbors saw it as retterin. 
The communities began in 1988 with the planning a Hurston festival to show what could destroy the district with the construction of the motorway. 
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January, many returning for the ceremony. 
A few years later the county broke away from his road building projects. 
"The plans a fünfspurigen highway crowded the city to speed up the whole thing with top speed, raises genuine citizens proud," said Mrs nathiri said. 
Mrs Boyden put it more simply: "Zora rescued Eaton Louisville." 
The victory against the highway project has helped to change the image of the city itself. 
There were more and more to travel, as an activist Munson, a lawyer who is, since 1993, here in the church, and residents began to appreciate the past. 
Eaton Louisville has been included in the 1998 Nationwide historic register. 
A new einstöckige Library (named, of course, after Hurston) opened in 2006 across the neugepflasterten and doctored Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today, Eaton Louisville still an anomaly in Florida, just 6 miles from the town centre Orlando they can anfühlen is sometimes as, founded as small as then as they are of only 27 black families in the 1880ern a short alleyway in the summer rain. 
(It is nowadays to 90% black.) 
Outsiders in search of history Eaton Louisville and its significance are still often treated with caution. 
For most of the interview an authorisation in advance is necessary, and certain things - such as the wall painting by Eaton Louisville eldest church which was painted by a white and black men in the field work - not to be photographed. 
Many in Eaton Louisville, as Mrs Jones, a bold, assertive teacher with a penchant for Dunkelrot, still fear that their secretive community is misunderstood. 
And yet, at the same time, to the greater the Hurston festival was also an increased degree was born at home proud. 
Young people in particular tend to see Eaton Louisville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, either worse or better, just as proud, creative, hard-working, silly and blended as any other racial groups and peoples in America. 
It is the sincere love for this town, which you could hear the voice of Mr Franklin nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, the plans after the college after Eaton Louisville in the town hall or working with the police, who could use a little help according to him. 
And even the younger, like Alondra and Alexia Keno, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park have learned to describe Eaton Louisville correctly. 
"Most people who drive only here will think: 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the other" Alondra Keno said recently on Sunday after the church. 
"But if you stop and consider for a moment in its history, it is a very beautiful city."
