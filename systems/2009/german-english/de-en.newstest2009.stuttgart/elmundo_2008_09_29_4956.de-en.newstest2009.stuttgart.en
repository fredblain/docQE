To their great appearance with your sister does not prevent them to develop their own personalities. 
Mónica Cruz is diminutive but fully joie de vivre. 
At present, the siblings gruz take their new activities in the fashion very seriously. 
For Mónica this means much more than for some beautiful and rich Mädels, who maintain their reputation. 
She was Mango in Paris in the promotion of the company, then moved their residence and also the presentation of the main prizes in the fashion which sponsors the Spanish fashion house power. 
Mercifully shy, winner of short-sea.

My sister and I are both also fascinated by the films of the 1950s and year; there, we find many ideas. 
I am in a city and observing women as they are, dressed as you combine their garments, which I am often. 
Dancer, actress and fashion Designerin, you are a very diverse women are not true? 
I believe so, but eventually, all hits in one and these areas have many things in common. 
Since I was small, I was enchanted by the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother, herumzuwühlen in the clothes cupboards my aunt and see their clothes. 
This was super to go almost better than in a leisure park. 
Even then, as dancers, I attempted to look at the clothes. 
You know we dancers like it so much, to have our own style of teaching and the samples, to look into the mirror and handsome. 
As an actress, when you get the suit, we put ourselves into the real heroes. 
Finally, everything is interlinked, there is so much respect for the suit design and professionalism.

So, have heard from becoming a mother, or not? 
For a long time, I know that I am a mother, because that is what my body and I want to be a young mother, I will not miss me. 
As far as the nominee, because I am not worried. 
I am going to send my child great happiness and raise it with a lot of love. 
With regard to the film industry, du behältst in the work in which you have taken part and which was held last year. 
That is exactly what it is and I would be very much that you presented to the public. 
I, as a woman who comes from the theater am very impatient and restless and everyone wants to know what may not be immediately. 
I very much hope that 'La última Hora' and 'en busca de la tumba de Cristo' names for the first time. 
Let us see how she stabbed disease 
A few days ago, you are appearing on the rose with Naomi Campbell, is it? 
Yes, telling as what is and is not. 
It is not that I took to the course rose to model. 
, Naomi Campbell, which I know for some time rang simple and invited to London to take part in a parade for the charity event of its organisation 'Women for a better world' and the clothing that we show, and I know that two garments were sold off from our range of mangos to collect money for Naomi NGOs. 
People know Naomi good heart. 
It will be told many things about you., I, as the person who knows you would say that you do not vote. 
Nevertheless, I will support this excellent business, in which it is involved. 
She asked me to take part in the parade for this noble thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a clear stand, I shall do so. 
In order to support women in the third world, which is also necessary.
