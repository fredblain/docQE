The debate about bilingual education: education in English language environment 
In this version of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, senior scientific staff in kalifonische studies and senior director in the specialist field of education sciences to the vessel named Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "is not as good as we thought: why the middle class needs a school choice". 
Hispanic voters is to address a complicated task. 
's Barrack Obama's proposals on the subject of education is a typical example. 
Obama campaign referred to the "probability for African-American and Hispanic students to school success, is lower than it is among white pupils' - what. 
To close the achievement gap, Obama's education plan recommends special among other bilingual transition in the training for those who learn English first. 
Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether its use for the bilingual education which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, his interest, to reduce the gap in the school performance. 
Let us take the example of 'Sixth Street "preparatory conference", "an elementary school in East Los Angeles. 
The majority of pupils are hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently in the country, an English learning. 
Nevertheless, an astonishing 100 percent in 2008 pupils was the fourth classes the state tests in math on a good footing. 
Also surprising 93 per cent of children have been assessed for the fourth school year in the English test as well. 
This astonishing success was achieved through other methods, than those who are favored by Obama. 
The school Sixth Street focused on review and exercise, by constant monitoring of knowledge and an attitude that tolerated no exception. 
Moreover, the schools used the approach according to which the training runs in an English-language surroundings. This is precisely the point that Obama should take, the school head, Linda Mikel. 
This approach places value on the nearly exclusive use of English in the specialist teaching. 
Mrs Mikel, which rejects the idea bilingual education said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil who was first on the verge of Mexico. Twelve months later, we were entering the classroom and they are able to inhabit not more. 
"It works," she observes, "it works for us". 
Obama would take a school as the "sixth" preparatory conference "street" as a model for other schools with a large percentage of Latin American and other English learners pupils? 
The performance of the schools would make the answers to these questions, but the education policy positions within his own party (the National bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time the idea bilingual education), and his own consistent support of bilingual education to make predictions about Obama answer uncertain. 
While it agrees with the score that immigrants should learn English, he trivialized the issue recently when he said that people should stop worry about on "English only" goal of legislation. 
Instead, he said, "they would ensure that her child can" in Spanish. 
If Obama wants to close the achievement gap actually, he must take a careful formation model that works to despise and to trivialise rather than you.
