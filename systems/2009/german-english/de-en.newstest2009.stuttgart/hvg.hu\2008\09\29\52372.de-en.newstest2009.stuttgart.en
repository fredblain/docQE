What has been produced in the bill factories from closing & amp; Co.? 
On 8 October, the negotiations begin in criminal proceedings against János award and his accomplices. 
The defendants, particularly of the involvement of organized crime, and grossly negligent damage and business fraud and other offences - including document forgery - is accused. 
According to prosecutors from the tendering lukrierten funds were used for his own purposes, while the performance was often in counterfeit bills. 
State money and grants from the self-governance - overall huf 65 million - are to be part diverted into the coffers of the organisation fiatal baloldal, share in the private individual funds. 
As the investigation authorities gave known, was presented at the source of the tender money fictitious accounts, and the club will not be fulfilled their duties too. 
According to the indictment, a large portion of the bill are alleged to have rigged. 
The bill units have been purchased in the market by józsefváros, the round marks were left in kiskunhalas done. 
The decision, issued on what companies the bill should be decided on the trip north of Lake Balaton, sent to the István Lado of János award. 
During the 'fact-finding tour "Lado pension and restaurants should be identified. 
He demanded give Bill konsumationen to later on this submission based bill for the Youth and Sports Ministry, the social and labor department, as well as the autonomy of Budapest. 
This bill should be manipulated by István Lado and his accomplices, András öri, the latter should be according to our information for the Constitution of the relevant report. 
One of the aims of Lado '"fact-finding tour" a local beer. 
As two of the award and Co in 2003 issued bills is waning, the restaurant business should have bewirtet the 90 members of the Group of the clubs biztos Pont egyesület. 
Now the head of the operation, but there is such a large group would have included not suddenly in the restaurant. 
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002, on the foundation jobb jövöért, later known as Alpha együtt harmadik évezredért also had serious form and content mistakes. 
In a pension in badacsonytomaj who only has three bedrooms and accommodation for no longer than 10 people at the same time, it should have stayed on the bills 130 passengers. 
The imagination of the bills counterfeiters were conventioneers and no boundaries when it came to the pigal kft., a catering company, in whose accounting records of customers also-rans jobb jövöért and hoppá according to prosecution authority. 
AS business leaders gyözö Farkas told the hvg.hu, was it immediately clear that they are fake documents, as were presented to him by the public prosecutor's office during a consultation documents. 
"Our company name and the tax number was right on the mark. 
And another: apart from formal errors and the fact it was wrong that the company should have played host a hundred people, having, in all, eleven rooms that offer impossible so many people. 
Food was also on the bill was referred to the restaurant was for a long time, are no longer in operation. 
The diligent Bill counterfeiters have failed to verify that the of them targeting noted Budapest travel agencies offering exclusive travel abroad and so they have given Hungary trip on the cash accounts of what the company's accounting practice contradicted. 
As was said during the investigation known, they have cited in addition to the bill in the withdrawal from VAT, despite the travel office services which relate to a country outside the EU, value added tax free. 
The level of VAT was a total of four from the hotel to the foundation révfülöp kft. jobb jövöért invoices issued false, as the enterprises denominated 25 rather than only 15 per cent VAT, moreover, by the staff exclusively air-conditioning bills are issued, the fake documents, however, were written. 
Another error, which was undermining the "Leger", was the fact that she had indicated in one case "goods" than provided, although this will be offered by the company that specialises in investment advice not, the prosecutor said. 
Further formal errors, false invoices format, false stamps - was that of a együtt harmadik évezredért alapítvány and XXI. Századi kulturális egyesület and biztos Pont identified as counterfeit bills could be issued. 
Just as in the case of Ravenna bt. and the sport camps kunfehértó whose business leaders protested issued to the bill. 
Another "mistakes" is undermining the counterfeiters during the Hib kft. from Nyíregyháza: the company teetered on the period (2001) is now in liquidation, as the Group of fiatal városért egyesület should have eaten, the estate administrator had therefore issued to the bill. 
Deliberately falsified 
The other group of invoices Leger are people, which was perfectly aware that you are fictitious accounts. 
At the request of the fiatal baloldal - ifjú szocialisták Foundation esély budapestért alapítvány has évezredért bill for the foundation együtt A. harmadik, issued at a height of approximately huf 4 million. 
According to the indictment, the executive director of the Collab kft. by one of the defendants, Ludovic györfi was persuaded to issue the fictional account. 
The present also in liquidation of biogate kft. should have cooperated with Award and Co.: in 2003, GmbH Foundation jobb jövöért alapítvány, as well as the clubs atlasz egyesület and vörösfenyö egyesület is said to have supplied with counterfeit bills in the overall value of huf 5 million related to not performance. 
There was, though, to note nor payment transactions, as the bill was cancelled immediately after their exhibition, which those concerned in your documents have forgotten. 
The third group of invoices Leger covers persons, be associated directly with the defendants. 
One of them is KFT Iván kubatov, the postman of Ukraine's business leaders in the delta trió., a resident in Budapest, where but untraceable fuel and vehicle trading firm. 
The company is said to have issued during the period of October to December 2005 several bills on the sale of computer components in the overall value of huf approximately 18 million. 
According to the investigating authority since 14 September 2005 into liquidation of cash investment kft. should have acted out kiskunhalas as buyers of these accounts. 
Executive officer of this company was a Rumanian, which the company documents should be delivered by Iván kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information kubatov during the investigation has been issued to account in the name of GmbH. to the clubs atlasz and hoppá and együtt A. harmadik évezredért alapítvány and cashed their value. 
The firms FA Bani Jos faipari kft. and Jos investment bt. apparently been founded by Romanian bricklayers at Iván kubatovs express request. 
In reality, none of these companies has been active, according to what was accused of a lack of orders. 
However, he was able to take advantage of the companies, at the request of his accomplices, the lawyer Zsolt szent, who was charged with preparing the firms founding documents, he has issued on behalf of the firms bills in the award in clubs, such as in atlasz and Y generáció. 
Overall kubatov should have issued 15 bills in the overall value of huf 14,2 million on behalf of corporate cash investment, Delta trió, FA Bani Jos, Jos investment and linaxtrade to the organisation. 
The public prosecutor's office expects kubatov could have cashed each 10% of the amount and value added tax. 
Kubatov even the firm szi beri bt. should have abused for the exhibition fictitious accounts - in this case, the Bills have already been ironed out the candidatures of biztos Pont. 
The firm Y generáció szövetség and a modern magyarországért delivered in January 2006, its application in the voluntary organisations of the Socialist Party, táncsics mihály alapítvány "(TMA). 
Both received more than 500,000 forints, these figures have taught us but derailed. 
To cover this, you have presented the TMA five fictitious accounts of work teams kft.. 
The bills were seized during the raid on the offices of árpád kemecsei in the education ministry. 
During the talks, expected by some defendants with a confession on the method of counterfeiting, as they were discarded before the public prosecutor's office. 
A tabloid, could be the main defendants János award decides to a full confession. 
His previous indications were also detailed less, and although he had pledged several times to report information about all that his confession is yet to come. 
The question remains as to whether it is in its interests, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the reparation of the bulk of the damage caused by huf 50 million, and whether the award in return is prepared to assume responsibility. 
However, it is quite possible that award is playing the "insulted" when his pleas were met with alleviating the imprisonment and house arrest on deaf ears. 
While other criminal, caused the economic crimes with far greater damage and remunerated for this not to be released, or at least under house arrest, strike remains this way denied.
