For lost data competent officials accused 
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officials who had lost in June strictly confidential documents in a train will be charged under the "public safety laws". 
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train after Waterloo. 
The document has been transmitted to the BBC before it was handed to the police. 
It is the weakest charges within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent. 
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was for many in white Hall a surprise. 
He said: "You would have thought that would be dealt with internally in the Ministry of Defence and cabinet." 
The employees, whose names cannot be named is charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause, which deals with the safe storage of information. 
The Royal prosecutor recommended that the officers should be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the extremely sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence kommitee.

He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was raised by his house in a secret location.
