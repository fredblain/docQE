Now the written version of the 700 billion dollar bailout bill is difficult to apply it in phases and will be on the banks of the bad loans of banks is aimed at. 
In the first round for half the money should be spent. 
In a session that ended on Saturday after midnight local time East Coast, have to announce to the members of Congress to debate lasting several days to reach agreement on the 700 billion dollar heavy rescue package, Reuters reported. 
"We have made substantial progress", Nancy Pelosi, Democratic chairman in the U.S. House of Representatives said, and believes that we need to reconcile the agreement only on paper. 
The compromise that has been reached on the bailout both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson thinks the outcome: the programmes will be effective and efficient, we need to do more, according to Pelosi was not talking about the bailout of Wall Street but rumzureißen the helm of the economy. 
The written version of the package before the opening of Asian markets, that is to say, The Washington Times Sunday night (8 p.m Central European Time Monday 2 p.m. tomorrow), published, caused but no soaring on the stock. 
On Monday the House of Representatives over a bill to stabilize the economy by 2008 vote first, then the Senate is on the list. 
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday evening with Pelosi, and also the White House welcomed the news about the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress made in the middle of the night, and the efforts made by both parties, to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman said. 
The programme deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush administration that the 700 billion dollar spent at once on the banks of the lazy, with loans tainted securities. 
In a first tranche maximum half the $700 billion is to be spent, with 250 billion are immediately available, after the congress is expected to vote on Monday on the causa. This amount will be devoted to buying bad credit, securities, and on the further USD 100 billion the president to decide. 
The scheme will be reviewed by an independent commission, which included the president of the Federal Reserve. 
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a decision of Congress. 
In the spirit of the law the Treasury can also apply a combined tactics: it can purchase bad loans, but at the same time, with mortgages and mortgage securities and other "toxic" loans. 
As people in charge of the ministry reported that the purchase in both auction, as well as direct. 
The law makes it the companies concerned, in an insurance scheme, in which the Treasury guarantees the worrying resources, and the companies are paying the expected damage appropriate charges. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary resources so that up to 700 billion dollars can be allocated to emergency aid for the American financial system at our disposal, whether it be for the large-scale purchase bad products, their insurance, or to avoid systemic risk that is triggered by the collapse of a major financial institution. 
The necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared to introduce the legislation, once it has been signed, so Paulson. 
The head of troubled and now on government aid banks can however expect their handling, the casual in overseas slang known as "gold hands shaking," will be cut short by the government. 
A reduction in the wages will only exist in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Treasury aushilft each. 
The cuts essentially means that if the ministry is buying at auction, taxed as the "gold" is hands shaking, unless the outgoing Bank boss is being pushed into the pension. 
In the case of a direct purchases of bad loans, the government will get aggressive, ensure that the managers' salaries are not excessive. 
The images also heard that the existing gold be changed hands shaking contracts, the restrictions only relate to new agreements, so that more people are able to participate in the programme. 
This is the first case in American history that cutbacks on managers' salaries should be regulated by law, the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the finance committee annotated, the measure. 
The state wins participation rights for the participating banks, so that the risk to taxpayers is falling because they can participate, as soon as the economy, and hence also of the rescued bank is better. 
The draft law stipulates that the President must submit to Congress in the next five years, a proposal on how the taxpayers to get their money out of the financial sector again. 
There were, however, on both sides of the skeptics who have voiced in relation to the plan their doubts. 
That is not what the American people expect us to the plan to protect taxpayers' money no case, Darrell Issa of California Republicans. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said the measures were propelled by the same people who are also for the collapse of Wall Street responsible.
