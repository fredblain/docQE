Housing Company B & B see costs envisaged 
British housing society could stand following the rescue of Bradford and Bingley bank costs of more than Â£80 million. 
The government is 14 billion pounds available to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley 2.6 million customers. 
The interest rates on those loans will be paid by all companies who receive money from investors, including 59 construction companies 
The Director-General of the Association of housing Society (BSA), Adrian Cole said that it was "unacceptable" that the company and its members to pay. 
The 14 billion loan will be repaid at the end of the day, when Bradford & Bingley loans are repaid. 
But in the meantime it has accumulated interest rates will each year included those 700 financial companies that accept contributions. 
The programme to compensate by financial services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing societies are included in this figure. 
It is ironic that those institutions that have acted prudently... now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions to which were far less circumspect.

It said that every company should pay in proportion to the deposits that would keep it, and that the company had to pay together around 18% of the costs. 
The Treasury Department has estimated that the interest on the loan will amount to EUR 450 million pounds in 2009. 
This means that the company must procure 81 million pounds in the interest of the first year. 
Adrian Cole, the director general of the Association of housing Society, told the BBC that he may believe that this is unfair. 
It is ironic that those institutions that have acted prudently during the real estate boom now called upon to bear some of the costs from those institutions that were far less circumspect. 
According to the BSA no society has failed since the existence of the recordings in 1945. 
"We will watch all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks, to see what the alternatives are, to protect housing society and its members from potentially significant costs." 
The rates which are due in 2009, cover the seven months to the end of September this year until the end of March. 
In 2010, interest rates for a full year will be payable and that could be almost twice as much. 
Since construction companies are mutual organisation without society, its members will have to pay for the costs either by higher taxes or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
