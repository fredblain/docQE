Dark matter affected flight from spacecraft 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon when researching for bewildered oiled: dark matter greatly influenced the speed of spacecraft during so-called swing by maneuvers. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein might be not quite right. 
Almost 18 years the spacecraft 'Ulysses' flying through space. 
Because soon freezer end fuel pipeline of k√§ltetod threatening them now. 
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon for confusion - the swing by anomaly. 
The swing by is a flight maneuvers in space probes, during which they will be given extra momentum in a blue body, gravitating around the Earth. 
The probe could save a lot of fuel. 
The Euro-American research Huygens probe Cassini will use this physical trick as much as the solar probe Ulysses. 
What can the researchers, however, have for years been surprises: the missiles are not 100 percent as one would expect of it after the ancient law of gravity. 
Instead, there are irregularities in the speed limit. 
The probe into unexpected quickly or slowly. 
To date, the physicists could not explain to this effect. 
They taufte him swing by anomaly. 
Some experts fear that may even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the gravitational pull of matter by a curvature of the area may not be entirely correct. 
The American physicist Stephen eagle at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton believed still obstinately that Einstein erred, and tried to explain the swing by anomaly by means of so-called dark matter that Astronomen have identified in the universe. 
"Those responsible for the anomalies might be dark matter which could find themselves also very near the earth", he writes. 
Of the existence of dark matter's space scientists know first hand about ten years ago. 
It appears an attraction, its effect on other sky body to monitor. 
She herself is totally invisible, meaning that it sends out and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, in particular also no visible light. 
According to the calculations, the scientists say the dark matter is as much as good a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
