Sleepless nights for creditors of real estate proceeds 
The German banking system is relatively stable, later in the week German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück first. 
Just as well that politics, used the word "relative" and even einflocht that the German banking sector will be spared by the crises. 
Since the weekend, now occurred. 
The DAX quoted Munich real estate financier argued Real Estate (HRE) receives shielding a consortium of German banks a billion loan to cut itself off from the turmoil in the markets. 
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the credit aid amounted to EUR 35 billion. 
The proceeds, real estate should verzinsen only the part that will take them up. 
The money will come from private as well as public banks. 
Backgrounds are loss during daughter Depfa. 
The state financier had refinanced according to a newspaper report on long-term projects to which he gave money, extreme short-term - which is because of distrust in the markets now no longer possible. 
In the first six months of 2008, cash held in reserve for the bank was reduced by 95% to was million, also the capital ratio had given in May from 1.6 to 1,45 percent. 
The ongoing earnings and net proceeds from financial transactions fell compared to the previous year period to zero, the proceeds from Zuschreibungen to demands and certain securities and from the breakup of reserves in the lending fell by more than 70 per cent to 5 million. 
It was only thanks to higher yields from reimbursement of downstream billing costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa groups and for the reimbursement of interest rates after the charges and from the rules of errand for corporations company that yield minus had higher at around 16 percent more moderate. 
The former state financier had verspekuliert following its privatization in 1990 with first commercial real estate lending, which were eliminated in the Aareal Bank. 
Because they earned in the classic state financing too little, the DEPFA had committed then stepped up in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects private investors and the state (private-public partnership (PPP) and diversifizierrt internationally. 
On the values of the daughter of the real estate should be about to undertake write-offs that have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, to say it quite vague. 
The fact is that the dividend was scrapped. 
And in 2007 it had been cut by two thirds. 
The proceeds, real estate is part of the DEPFA acquisition an important state and infrastructure spending. 
It is more than other Institute of the refinancing in the interbank market, since it has no client no. 
With the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago has dried up lending among banks again, largely because the banks were hoarding liquidity. 
The proceeds, real estate takes a year for a partial - around 50 billion - the loan portfolio of DEPFA short-term funds to refinance. 
After the announcement of the proceeds, real estate, the funding requirements of the group is satisfied with the credit for the foreseeable future, and the company insulated "from the influence of the current largely functioning international money markets". 
From other sources that the refinancing by the end of 2009, thanks to the money saved. 
Der HRE CEO Georg Funke said, however, that the proceeds, real estate group will not need the money markets for the foreseeable future, exercise more. 
The Federal Reserve and the Federal Institute for financial services regulator (BaFin) assume that the marketability of plate real estate group was assured. 
It is to be hoped for shareholders and creditors of the bank. 
But given the momentum and uncertainties about the crisis there is probably not a certainty. 
It is even possible that the financing must be taken in full. 
But the opposite is not auszuschleißen. 
After the bank was on the late Sunday night reportedly before the insolvency, also provisionally rescue able to calm down. 
The stock price is collapsing by 75 percent to 3,30 euros. 
Well the bond prices keep opposing it. 
The primary debt strokes are barely budged, show the rate of senior bonds after spending significantly. 
Primarily affect the bonds of former subsidiary Baden-Württemberg plate and understandably, through 2009 its duration. 
Scenarios seem real estate loans previously a speculative investment alternatives, so their value even when the clear upgrading of the banking crisis and the Institute itself, with the acquisition of DEPFA had picked up the crisis first into the house must be regarded by the stability of the international financial system. 
As long as the central banks, governments and less risky to prop up the banking system are prepared, as long as it can be taken by a timely repayment of pensions. 
Or it is what now hardly anyone dares to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months. 
However, in the light of the partial nationalisation of crushing reports currently only be hoped is from the security probably become. 
This should not cause long-term creditors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to get rid of their commitment. 
Short-term investors can use a line, so as to provide a loss lecture for future Abgeltungssteuer payments to price gains later in the year.
