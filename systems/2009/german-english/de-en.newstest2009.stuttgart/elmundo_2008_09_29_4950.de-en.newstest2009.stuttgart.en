The Olympic Games in the streets of Madrid are flawed. 
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organise some Olympic sport in Madrid, after the failure to 2012, it may be perhaps in 2016. 
But I ask myself: 'We are all prepared for this?' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old road, I would say that it is not true! 
It was described as a perfect roads, and in my opinion, that she was the worst roads with all deals and about which there was. 
Of course, there is a lot of nonsense if you would respect the evaluation and I could see, so what would come through clearly are not. 
But as we go through from the outset. 
The nonsense starts with the ticket repeat that allows you to go first. 
It also seems to me to be no bad thing, but if they let you do, then you should give you all (including chip to avoid the congestion on the roads). 
But not so. 
Here they can get you just the ticket (the first nonsense that is to be the only reason then) and (after an endless queues) as is the surprise! the T-shirts, there were only in the size of '(a second nonsense because I need the size XL) 
Where are we living in fact? 
Or is it the case that a decision has been taken after the crisis only small to buy much cheaper shirts from less fuel? 
Well, things like this is peanuts compared to the days on the road. 
Apart from the fact that you can go very early to get the chip, there is already a queues of at least 15 minutes and, furthermore, it must be subject to the backpack. 
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which, in the case of a road, where 11 000 people are expected, is incomprehensible. 
Finally, as was to be expected, the road began and we had to lie back our bags, fear, even if it was successful, but they would recover more difficult. 
Furthermore, it seemed, in this 40 minutes waiting for rain, so too the temptation was to organise a popular uprising and to HÃ¤uschen. 
I believe that tomorrow, of course, some 500 people have lung inflammation and some seem like myself are because this chip, which I received, not even in time for the classification, I am quite sure that the outcome was branded wrong. 
Of course, if you would ask me for a perfect Road, these roads would never come. 
So I believe that we will still have dreams long from a city which is prepared for the Olympics well
