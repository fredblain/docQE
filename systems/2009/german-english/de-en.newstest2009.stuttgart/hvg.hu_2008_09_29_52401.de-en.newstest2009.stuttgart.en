Believers have less pain? 
As the latest research show that the religious believe honesty as a kind of 'analgesics', which should already have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs. 
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it has investigated how influenced the belief in God the pain of the people, the British journal Telegraph reported. 
In the wake of rather bizarre investigations ever 12 believers and atheists received electrical shocks while they studied a painting of the Mother of God. 
As the results show, the believers to eliminate most of the pain. 
Using a brain scan technology have shown that even the Catholics could activate the part of your brain that is for the pain regulatory competence. 
The study was the first in a research project in which philosophers and theologians participate as well as scientists from different sections of the university. 
In seeking a glittering machine on the left hand were the subjects, which stun resigned. 
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: a picture of the Mother of God of Sassoferrato, painted in the 17th century, and, on the other hand, Leonardo da Vinci "lady with the Hermelin." 
The researchers are hoping that the sight of the Virgin Mary among believers would provoke a kind of religious trance, while she chooses da Vinci picture because differences is almost the same as the other paintings and as was felt reassuring. 
People spent more than half an hour in an MRI scanner, and a total of 20 stun received in this period in four stages, while they should see either the religious, or the other paintings. 
The Catholics reported that they had felt at the sight of the Mother of God "in security", as if they were 'after', and they would have felt "calm and peace '. 
During the view of religious paintings you talked about 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo stations. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias who attended the attempt thought we could cause similar effects with other, strong retrospective images in the atheists, it would be just the right photo. 
"We must find a form which resulted in very positive sentiment, such as a mother or a father", the psychologist. 
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomes the results of the research. 
"The practice of faith should change our personalities, and do it well in many cases," Wright. 
After these excellent results only, the question remains as to what effect on pain regulation of believers a Madonna picture Leonardo or any other comparable painter. 
The high-end Virgin Mary would achieve better results?
