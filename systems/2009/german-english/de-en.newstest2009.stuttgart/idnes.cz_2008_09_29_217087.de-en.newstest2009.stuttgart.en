The first virtual providers comes earlier this year after the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is fully developed legal, the Czech providers offering virtually all the services, as they are being offered by their counterparts in Western Europe. 
Nevertheless, a virtual service providers, which forces the classic at lower prices missing something here. 
Perhaps it will not wait much longer. 
That Czech mobile providers are among the most expensive in Europe, as we have said on many occasions to mobil.cz. 
Moreover, the Telecoms Authority ctú, which draws attention to the fact that the price for an SMS confirmed here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. 
According to the latest steps taken by the European Commission in terms of regulation of roaming charges is as likely to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile operators SMS will be from abroad is cheaper than at home. 
How is it that the price in the Czech Republic are compared with Europe so high? 
The answer is simply because there is the competition which really makes a declaration of war. 
Perhaps sounds it paradoxical, in the Czech Republic, there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%. 
The mobile phone operators rant against be pleased that there is on the Czech market extreme much competition. 
The chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ctú) Pavel Dvorák, agrees with many who had voiced in the past too, that there is in the Czech Republic, there is no place for another provider. 
It is likely that a classic providers with its own network no longer has a great many opportunities (incidentally, it would probably be too little frequencies). 
But there was still a possibility - a virtual providers. 
It is precisely the advocates of virtual reality providers in the mobile phone market has led to a sharp price drop, to respond to the traditional mobile phone operators. 
There was before the advent of such firms such as Tesco mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in the UK, a similar vote as in the Czech Republic. 
It has been shown, however, that there is room for such suppliers and that this can be really successful. 
Moreover, we need to look not long after. 
In February we have reported on the start of the virtual providers mobile King in Poland. 
In only half a year, this supplier to win more than one hundred thousand customers and emerge as the five largest service providers in the country. 
Behind mobile King the financial group penta-, which, in the Czech Republic among other subway: FON. 
The advantages of virtual reality providers stems from the fact that we can concentrate on a much more specific target groups. 
In order to be effective, virtual operators do operate far fewer customers than a classic providers. 
You need a relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance a mobile network. 
In the world as the virtual providers to thrive normally as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service. 
For example, Tesco mobile in Britain SMS offers at least half of cheaper than its competitors. 
As the example of mobile King in Poland shows, however, it may be a good move to bet on a not stereotypes in target groups. 
Those suppliers is specifically directed at men. 
"real guy select mobile King - the providers that pleases you and you can trust," David Seibert, the chief executive of the mobile entertainment company, the company this virtual providers. 
It's hard to say whether a similar concept could take hold as in Poland and in the Czech Republic. 
There is also the spokesperson of Vodafone Miroslav cepický doubted: "The Czech market that is based on a market segment, for which the majority of virtual operators, relatively small. 
He also is saturated from the point of view of the services offered relatively. " 
In the Czech Republic to invalidate the mobile operators my 
However, it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile operators in the Czech Republic will be conquered, not this mobile King. 
"We talk about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations are not very hopeful. 
It will, rather, come to a market entry of mobile King in other countries of the region, "Jana studnicková, press spokesperson of financial groups penta- says in a telephone conversation on mobil.cz. 
Indirectly, it confirms that the present mobile operators in the Czech Republic favor this idea not terribly. 
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything we can to ensure that no potentially competitor. 
Her interest in a launch a virtual mobile operators shows for some time now the groups GTS Novera who wish to take a further step to be a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in wholesale. 
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network, but also mobile telecommunications services. 
And the sooner, the better. 
These opportunities we have negotiated repeatedly with all the Czech mobile operators. 
Some of them we have already managed to achieve progress in negotiations, "the spokesperson of the group Pavel kaidl. 
Perhaps now better times. 
From no official information indicates that the first virtual operator is to expect, perhaps by the end of the year. 
So far, but it is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. 
"At this moment, we do not believe that there is room for one in the Czech Republic full-fledged virtual providers. 
The Czech market shows over other markets big specifics. 
Yet there is no subject has raised with a complex and serious projects in this area, "said in his statement on mobil.cz Vlastimil srsen from the press department of Telefónica O2. 
On the specific characteristics of the Czech market providers indicate. 
The press spokesperson of T mobile Martina kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement by O2: "So far we have not yet found any viable and mutually advantageous project, on which we can build." 
And she adds: "in the network of T mobile a virtual providers will appear before the end of the year. 
At this very moment, we need to have a specific offer to be able to do so in the short term. " 
Vodafone also focussed his attention on compliance with the requirements of their own 3G licences. 
Miroslav cepický it says: "for negotiations with potential virtual providers we are open, particularly in the area of the division of costs and infrastructure. 
This is exactly what we see from the point of view of the customer the best. 
The principal strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet. " 
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand-in-hand 
The actions of the mobile phone providers is easy to understand another supplier said more competition, we will be faced with falling prices and this will also lead to a decline in profit. 
Why should facilitate so such competitors to enter the market? 
For those who can pull in the same direction when it comes to anything, also the long back and forth about the generation of subway: FON. 
Probably the strongest pressure towards ctú went out on time, as a subway: Fon came on the market, from society and T Mobile. 
The show also publicly accessible information from the ctú website. 
But now subway lends itself: FON as a reason why we should not allow a virtual providers. 
Martina kemrová said: "The competition environment of the mobile phone market have been strengthened recently even by entering the market a fourth mobile operators. 
Bearing in mind the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new player would make of the market itself and, above all, its services high demands. " 
Given this approach by the cellular providers the absolute lack of interest among the Czech regulatory authorities astonished, however. 
It is interfering in is not just about the attitude of the ctú in Czech unfortunately - in contrast to Britain and other highly developed countries - not the competence, in the economic competition. 
This is exclusively the Office for the protection of economic competition (úohs). 
But those referred to this whole problem throughout his typical attitude. 
"The market is a simulated mobile operators would then be possible, after it has come to a contract between a mobile operators and a virtual service providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
So far, no such agreement has been concluded, because the offer potentially interested buyers was probably on the traditional operators not sufficiently interesting, "in his response to our questions kristián chalupa from the external relations department of úohs. 
Representatives from providers, such an approach would not surprise. 
By an authority which is supposed to represent the interests of the consumer and eight, among other things, that nobody abused its market position, this is more than worrying. 
Especially if kristián chalupa adds: "abroad, where virtual providers are quite normal, we can see that the market has contributed to a reduced prices for mobile phone services." 
Probably, however, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and the prices are not in the interests of úohs. 
It is truly shocking in this case almost touching line of three mobile phone operators that stems from your reaction. 
The question whether it is really just an accident is obvious. 
Just as the absolutely same petrol prices at the petrol station is the only chance, and the result was a stiff competition. 
"The agency has discovered in this matter no signs that indicate a competition directed against the trade, and thus also has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter. 
None of the contractors a dominant position, he has also not the appropriate increased responsibility for his actions in the market. 
The necessary tools for the opening of the mobile market to virtual service providers lack probably also the regulatory authority for telecommunications chalupa ", says in his statement. 
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many contentious points. 
There is of course an analysis of relevant markets, drawn up by the ctú, following the telecommunications sector from the point of view of economic competition is a single market. 
In such a market none of the Czech mobile operators still has a dominant position. 
Some legal experts but offer another angle - for access to the market of virtual operators the consent of network operators is always necessary. 
And the mobile phone providers - logically - for his network's monopoly. 
Which means that he is in a particular segment necessarily has a dominant position. 
Even if one ball but with this reasoning, it should be for the úohs at least a warning that three mobile phone operators do remarkably similar. 
However, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned society GTS Novera) proves that they will have in negotiations with all the operators of similar obstacles. 
The shifting the responsibility onto the ctú is then in the telecommunications services provided a legal standard ploy which úohs distanced himself from the whole affair. 
This has been a number of similar cases. 
Unfortunately, it has not been implemented, in the recently adopted amendment of the telecommunications legislation extending the competences of the ctú in the fields of economic competition in the telecommunications sector, although a number of experts had promised that an improvement in the situation. 
The representatives of the úohs must know only too well, but probably you have other interests. 
It is, if anyone looks 
Unappreciated remains once the operation of any pseudo virtual providers, of which there is in the Czech mobile networks several. 
There are companies that spend their own price list for mobile telecommunications services, which are only partly open to the public. 
Usually these are companies that are active in the field of multinational level marketing. 
Its own mobile phone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, stars life and others. 
The price list of these companies will normally just to be selected. 
The joke of the matter is that the company's performance against the operators as a classical firms client who ordered a large quantity of SIM card. 
As an important customer he then gets special offers of prices (and other services). 
The problem is that the business conditions to ban all Czech mobile operators a similar kind of resale. 
"If there are some cases which you describe, it may be a violation of the contractual conditions, which we are dealing with, which can lead to a cessation of work with the appropriate levels of society", Martina kemrová responded to our questions about this problem. 
However, it is unlikely that it spreads in the upper echelons of the mobile operators. 
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned may be thousands of customers. 
No operator opposes such an approach. 
From the activities of those firms to flow so that they are not inconsiderable profits, at the same time it - unlike the real virtual providers - should not be affected by the real official marketing. 
On the possible problems Miroslav cepický points out: "The law allows these types of speculation, despite all the services of the two companies are to be used only by a very small percentage of customers. 
This must accept that the SIM card in your phone on your behalf, they could not do so full it as ordinary customers of the mobile phone providers. " 
This alone, but the ctú should occur at the very least, strange. 
Furthermore, another question arises for the úohs. 
The mobile phone operators from such an approach in closing our eyes to this, why they are opposed to virtual service providers? 
It should be added that the úohs for detecting such activity has strong legal powers, and if it does not, it must not be limited to the declaration of providers, them unaware and their business conditions would forbid it, satisfied. 
When the Czech Republic is no longer in the costliest 
As has been said repeatedly, the text of the market entry virtual providers brought a sharp drop in prices in the different services. 
In practice in all the countries where virtual providers have arisen, try the traditional operators, to prevent the emergence of practical, more or less. 
The substances they use arguments were virtually identical - is too small, or too much saturated marketplace, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
In the highly developed countries but intervened at this very moment the regulatory bodies, which tries to safeguard the interests of the mobile phone operators, but their customers. 
Whether through formal or informal pressure, you got the first virtual operator arose, and this further. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies to comply with the whole event like a hot potato. 
On the basis of our experience we cannot dispose of the impression that there is confusion over the competence in these cases more than favorable. 
Yet we treat the shotgun into the grain. 
If the background information and soon a virtual providers emerge, the Czech mobile market will perhaps soon be moving again. 
If a service provider does the emergence of a virtual mobile operators, there will not be any discrimination in úohs motionless, when it comes to rejecting, further interested parties (). 
And the Czechs are not speaking once more expensive than the rest of Europe.
