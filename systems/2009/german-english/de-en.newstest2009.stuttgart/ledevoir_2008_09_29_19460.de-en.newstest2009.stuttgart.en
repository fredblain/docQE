The letter - a dishonour country 
Mr Vic Toews, the former justice minister allowed '(how ironic) in the cabinet Harper did last summer, to say about Louise Arbour, it was a "disgrace" for Canada. 
For these women, who has led a never-ending battle for justice and all our admiration deserves to cover it with opprobrium says as much about the people to the prime minister, as Stephen Park itself. 
We are dealing here with a government that has been taken as the only for all the countries affected their in the concentration camps at Guantanamo prisoners compatriot not home. 
A government that does not even know that Omar Khadr was still a young man, when the things happened, the accused him. 
The only government that in spite of the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaking its word and a child soldier under inhuman conditions are rotting. 
The only 'is a parody of justice, to assess the culpability of the accused. 
We bear in mind that, in particular, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers argue, Omar Khadr after house in Canada, that he will get a fair trial. 
It is precisely this government also closes its eyes to the torture, it has little interest that a young adults will be after so many years of torment certainly broken forever spiritually. 
We are still not aware of this, but what we have here is precisely an insidious curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", these words, which Harper standing before it like a banner, and that sounds from his mouth as meaningless. 
It is the time has come, in which there is no morality more: we must not abuse a Canadian citizen arbitrary, torture and imprisonment, quite fit after a head of government, which is backed up until today only by the minority (he will include after 14 October in the minority...). 
Many voters feel to find sanctuary in a party that virtue, law and order preaches. But they do not see that this administration has away from what the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The disgrace, Mr Toews lies in this secretive, and nowhere else.
