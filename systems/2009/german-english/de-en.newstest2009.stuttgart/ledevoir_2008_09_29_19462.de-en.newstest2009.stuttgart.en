Free expression - the Orwellian talk of Barrick Gold 
In its edition of 17 September Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, deputy director general of the Canadian gold mine Barrick Gold. 
This confirms and maintains an Orwellian logic that the biggest gold mining company in the world to have a defamation lawsuit over six million against three authors and a small loose publishing house, with the aim to open a 'public with transparent debate ". 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then you do not base their judgments on the truth, especially in the case of libel case, but above the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference was concealed by Mr Garver completely. 
As for Barrick Gold, the best way is to conduct a public debate to drive everyone into the ruins on anyone who dares to one of their opposing views. 
Whatever the outcome, the authors and the editor of the paper noir Canada will have to spend substantial sums to prepare their defence and are struggling with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who comes from the pockets of almost inexhaustible gold mine. 
The tactics in this unequal struggle is, moreover, often to ruin the defenders to enforce an amicable settlement, which the opposition party is muzzled and also discourage anyone who dares to look again at the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have to display their vision of things from public opinion. 
In contrast to what happens in many of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, and there is to be debate in Canada fought normally through the exchange of ideas, and not by truncheons whipping. 
It would have been enough if the gold mine would have opened up their books and files and opens a genuine debate, through the newspapers, media and publishing and financing independent assessment team that could shed light on this issue. 
But Barrick Gold seems to have no faith in the public opinion and side has dismissed the petitions and letters in support of the writers of noir Canada with one hand movements. 
Could perhaps explain to Mr Garver, how can he please make a "public" debate and disregarding, but the level of public? 
Apparently this word in the world of Vice-President only generously remunerated lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a brilliant cramped, measuring only 10.7 m vision of the concept. 
In a democracy, the detractors have the right to speak. 
What Barrick do not understand - or understand not gold - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of noir Canada, this is above all because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
Public opinion is ready to listen Barrick and judging, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a context, whom many perceive as their knees complaint (during the "public debate" Barrick Gold has sent a request to the authors of noir Canada, in which she requires you to use this term not more...). 
Apart from the surreal speech from Mr Garver, the complaints of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth, which is fundamental to all democratic societies. 
They have denied the right to quote credible sources and discuss the facts and the interpretation which form the basis of intellectual work. 
If it is in a country like Canada impossible, to investigate and to discuss issues that favors the rich companies of this world, who can do it? 
If Barrick Gold really follow a public and transparent debate wanted, she could lead it by the scientific standards that were used by the authors of noir Canada. 
She has a right to reply. 
The academic environment to which we belong do for a long time to have debate and disagreement grip and resolve conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaints of Barrick Gold, clearly shows that it has, in contrast to what it claims, no desire to have transparent debate. 
It's a loss for the university world is, as it was for the public debate, and it is time for the governments to take measures to restrict this kind of unwarranted action.
