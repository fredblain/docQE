Conversation - from the blood that was safe again 
Hema Quebec yesterday, celebrates the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Dr. Francine décary had become every reason to rejoice, because Hema Quebec is one of the safest, most efficient blood bank in the world. 
And above all, she has recovered the confidence of the public, which has been rocked by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980's and 1990's. 
As you know, the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross managed national blood reserve during the 1980s were infected with HIV or the hepatitis C virus. 
In the face of this tragedy and the public discontent, the Canadian government launched in February 1994, a public, by the judge Horace Krever led investigation, which was intended to shed light into the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to draw up a directive in order to prevent new disasters of this kind. 
While judges Krever hesitates to give his report, several provinces then asked a committee on their feet, whose goal was to develop a new system for managing blood in Canada. 
Quebec's committee gélineau performed this task. 
After the report by gélineau and Krever Hema Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood Society to provide the other provinces, and the two territories was founded in Canada two blood banks:. 
"In 1998, Hema Quebec started its work, had almost 38% of people confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr décary remembers. 
The situation was daunting. 
Through the huge efforts to ensure the safety of the blood to improve and by the work in this area during the next year, we have won back the trust of the public, "she says, before they had laid a proud that, at the beginning of 2008 nearly 94% of the population of Quebec confidence in Hema Quebec. 
Dr décary but it retains the awareness that 'confidence is something extremely fragile'. 
Since its founding on 28 September 1998 Hema Quebec is acting in accordance with the principle of caution. 
This time we witnessed with the arrival of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, these women, who since its inception in 1998 the leadership said. 
"And we have not had the remotest idea whether the disease could be transmitted through the blood. 
So we convened at a main directive and the report by Krever gélineau that you use exclusion measures, if we do not and if the disease progresses slowly, as it is obvious in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is reflected through a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death. 
So we adopted in April 1999, no blood from people who had not been since 1980, more than a month in the United Kingdom. 
Now, a few years ago has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood. 
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution, which we would apply, the sense. 
In 1999, arrived on the market in a much more accurate techniques to detect HIV: the nukleinsäure tests (NST) that will enable us to demonstrate it, directly in the blood of the donor and the presence of the virus itself, and not the antibodies against the virus, as there was in the test has hitherto been the case. 
The NST allows us to shorten the incubation period, which will take place between the time when the infected person and, if the first viruses can be demonstrated by our technology in the blood, the specialist said. 
This time could be reduced to a span of less than a week. 
So the risk that certain donors could be infected, without being aware of it, and you could not see was much lower. 
This improvement will enable us to reduce the risk to transfer AIDS through a blood transfusion, to a considerable extent. 
These days, one of 12 million people is running the risk of getting HIV infected blood. 
"In other words, this means that we should allocate 12 million blood before someone infected with HIV. 
Since Hema Quebec distributed each year, between 400,000 and 500,000 blood, it would take more than 24 years before an event occurs, when the transfer of a blood packed HIV. 
I believe that it is possible to feel nowadays it well if you get a blood transfusion or prescribed to restore the health ', the head of the Directorate of Hema Quebec said. 
"Our challenge for the next ten years, the safety of our products. 
You never know, into the system which pathogens can reach. 
Only last year, has appeared on the island of Réunion, the chikungunya virus, which is transmitted in the same way as the westnil virus, by insects on the blood. 
We must monitor uninterrupted, "Dr. décary continued before it must be stressed that Hema Quebec alongside a secure supply also ensure adequate supplies available. 
"The fact that demand, because the population is getting older. 
Because the treatment for the cancer is aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or blood platelets. 
The ageing of the population works are on the blood donor network, with an average of only 3% of the blood donation suitable natives of Quebec. ' 
Every healthy person can, who is 18 years or older and the eligibility criteria donations, all 56 days, six times a year, blood. 
On average, 14% of the people who put their blood available are rejected because they are ill for example of AIDS or malaria, and anyone who has travelled in a country where malaria is excluded for a year in donations. 
"With this 3% to keep an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals. 
Lack of supplies are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of the donor network, if they can be older, and donating blood. 
The donation is difficult to convince people from blood, but above all to keep you and to encourage them to be regular donors. 
Life is now so hectic that you rarely had time to spend an hour in donations', Francine décary regrets. 
With an annual budget of EUR 297 million dollar Hema Quebec provided not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone grafting, heart valves and skin, augäpfel used almost exclusively for serious violations of fire. 
These tissues to be investigated, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema Quebec, which manages the only public cord blood banks Quebec. 
In the umbilical cord, which had been seen earlier than biomedical waste, is rich in stem cells in the blood, which can be used to treat diseases such as leukaemia. 
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the stockpiling of thousands of most cord blood samples, and we plan to wane, every year, more than a thousand. 
"We should start well at the beginning of next year in order to make it available for transplants," Dr. décary also declared, which describes this programme of umbilical cord blood tests as very popular. 
"Many of the mothers are convinced that they have no access to it 'because the Hema Quebec the resources to these complex and very costly programmes lack offer in all hospitals Quebec.
