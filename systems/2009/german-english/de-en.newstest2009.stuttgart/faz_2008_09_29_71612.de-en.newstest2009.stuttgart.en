Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt 
At big words lacking in the letter of by WestLB ran on to the staff of the House. 
Through a pool of unity of Düsseldorf Monetary Institute in Frankfurt Dean banks could create "the central capital market house of savings banks financial groups', it says in the letter on Monday reported. 
The by WestLB yield a "skills" block with sustainable profitability in this business. 
And any such links could be the decisive impetus to further concentration in the country's banking sector. 
So it is that if a board wants to demonstrate the capacity to act in difficult times. 
Because the wounded by WestLB, remains under tremendous pressure. 
Not only the Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for financial services regulator, which has made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalian provincial government recently, the urge to find a future solution. 
Of a sort of link between the Dean banks, the savings banks customers because of its investment funds, and by WestLB has however been for some time - also in Frankfurt. 
Although Dean bank chief Franz Waas has allowed during the presentation of the six-month figures know at the end of August, in a merger of the house in Mainz roadways with a bank, for example, of Helaba or by WestLB see it does not make sense. 
But the board of directors of the Dean, who will be paid half from each of the banks and the German savings associations, has asked the board to hold the talks by WestLB on joint operations. 
It could go to the capital market, businesses or parts of them. 
The talks, however, as it says in the financial marketplace, only just started. 
The Dean of banks, with their 3,000 staff to more important employers in the city of Frankfurt, is not the first time the speech when it comes to consolidation in the banks sector. 
In 2003 it looked for a moment as the Dean banks with the bank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba could merge. 
From these three did not. 
Hardly had become the plans public, the hessische provincial government against a turnout of Helaba spoke out. 
The two other homes were then not each other. 
The Land Bank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the bank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. 
But it has been repeatedly thought about linking Dean banks with Bank. 
Last but not least, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, spoke out against plan game on a combination with his house. 
Irrespective of this, but appears to raise the realization that a move together the various houses does the public service sector suffering. 
After the elections in Bavaria is now past, could get closer than only a combination of BayernLB with the Agricultural Bank Baden-Württemberg. 
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news. 
The pressure to rise further merger to go after her, and after the sides. 
In the South, it would become junior partner, although she has endured the financial crisis so far, far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A cooperating with the West LB, once again, of the Building Societies Association and Giro Hessen, Thüringen who is involved with 85 percent of Helaba is the beginning of the year, put a stop to this. 
There was, if anything, the North lb. 
This geostrategic considerations are however just one side. 
On the other hand, there is the question of how different business model of individual houses pass each other. 
In June, Merl, said that the crucial question, the business model for the future competitiveness of the country's banks to ensure it was answered by the German Savings Bank Association and Giro so far. 
At the end of a cutting the West LB could, however, there is of course not. 
The speech is because in the letter of the Bureau that there will be sought in any case a "global solution" to the House. 
How can you bring to a combination of individual entities with the Dean bank under one roof, will tell.
