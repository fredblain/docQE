'Sangre de Mayo': heroes book by Garci 
Inspired by 'episodios Nacional' of Benito Pérez galdós, José Luis carci represents in 'Sangre de Mayo', the revised version of the famous of the Spanish uprising against French. It is an admirable films in the filmographie, with approximately 15 million investment for the town. 
In this way the cineast has tried to portray "a lot of personal and social analyses', as he had always admired in the works of the famous novelist, today carci said at the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula echevarría at the beginning of a long list of characters. 
'Sangre de Mayo' with a film of more than two and a half hours will be presented this Friday in cinema and shown later on the Radio Tele Madrid as a four hour mini series. 
José Luis Garci, a fan of the literature of galdós assured that his' childhood dream 'was thanks to this pivotal work in fulfilling. He owes Esperanza Aguirre, who appointed him three years ago by the Autonomous Community of Madrid, to swing a commemorative film on the second century ceremony on 2 November in Madrid, and above all because the story is based on the basis of' episodios Nacional ', of the mandate adopted. 
The total contribution of EUR 15 million, which was released by the Autonomous Community of Madrid hub for work offers Garci, as he does, the 'unique opportunities' posing with the help of decoration and appropriate clothing that image of the 'confused Spain which was the wrong leader for the fight will pick, because the people expressed by the fight for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII of the Fallen. " 
But the cineast regrets that they could not count on the funding as in 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as in 'Sangre de Mayo'), which is why some scenes could not be rolling out the script with Horacio valcárcel, with the Garci working nearly his entire career. 
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in "Volver a empezar 'has played through his exceptional work: it is based on stage with the actor, with whom we must test first, before you start to swing and for those who had made no casting, he seemed" humiliating "and respect verschaffend," part of the profession of film director is to provide assistance in theatre and cinema, to see what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works. " 
So many performers, he encountered in 'Sangre de Mayo' must repeat before his camera Cuervo, as in the case of Miguel rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén. 
, Garci Oscar nominee in four nominations (of which he has won a) believes and gave assurances that none of the three candidates, who represented this year in Spain before the Academy of Hollywood, a younger generation of Spanish filmographie. Neither 'Sangre de Mayo', or 'Siete Mesa de billar known' and, finally, not the chosen films Los Gira aerosols ciegos'. 
For these films Garci expected no award. 
"At the beginning bet that du arbeitest for the descendants, later du merkst that is only for prosper, and now you are satisfied, if no one has yet produced a film, Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity," he said.
