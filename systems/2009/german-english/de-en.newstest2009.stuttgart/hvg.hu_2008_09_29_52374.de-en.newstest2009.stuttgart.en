The psychology of the game - or why we are prepared to pay more 
At an auction buyers tend to spend more and to exaggerate the deepest offered. 
Neurologen and economic researchers from the universities of New York managed to discover the neurological economic foundations that well-known and apparently irrational behavior. 
According to one in "Science" magazine published studies which people want to turn themselves in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, not beaten and are willing to pay even inflated prices. 
Researchers have tried to explore the neurological system this "game" with experimental auction. 
A group of volunteers should play the lottery, while the other was attending a playful action - in both cases were investigated the active brain regions of enrolled through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). 
In two games the participants to win money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain beef was measured at losers of the auction, which surpass the opponents also plays a major role. 
Among the many other functions these brain regions is to "reward" of the nervous system. 
The researchers said that the price increase could be by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum. 
To shore up their argument, The Economist went to the researchers added investigations for the follow-up of the money. 
In this case, three groups against a partner to bid under different conditions. 
The control group was notified of the true value of products, then you have made their operations. 
Another group was promised 15 dollar reward if they emerge as winners from the game. 
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were lost in the event of a lost game. 
The difference between the two groups was then only to find that the emphasis in the one was on the win, while in the other loses. 
As evidence of the neurologen expressed hypothesis, but members of the "against the" end game groups were prepared to higher stakes, as those in the control or the "winners" group. 
"These results may be interpreted by any previous economic theory. 
These have reasoned that at auction observed behavior, so far, only to the joy of the win, or the risk prevention. 
The contradiction between these two theories have been dissolved to the imaging neurological procedures, we are now in a third statement of Europe '- Andrew Scott, professor of economics faculty said the university in New York.
