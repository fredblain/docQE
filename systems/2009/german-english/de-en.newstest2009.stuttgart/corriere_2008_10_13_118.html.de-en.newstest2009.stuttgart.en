The Super Kleber, leaving high go to Wall 
The forces of gravity to defeat thanks to a glue and the walls to climb higher as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which is now seemingly almost there. 
With one in an area of just 2.5 qcm enraged Kleber succeeded the researchers to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall. 
The studio - an American magazine has published the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, of the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
A team of researchers devised by the material is used a further development of the already used glue which carbon Nano tube culture called a special carbon structure. 
"The principle of Kleber imaginable as a series to a pile of spaghetti ordered tubes," Zhong Lin Wang said from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The researchers were inspired by the feet of geckos, which are covered in microscopic h√§rchen that give the animal a perfect budget. 
The various materials such as glass Teflon and cutting paper tests have shown that the new Kleber is ten times greater than the ability to find their feet of reptiles and can be removed at the same time, "easily from the wall," Liming Dai, researchers at the faculty of engineering at the University of Dayton. 
At entlangwandern Mauern? "the material could be used as a transient glue" that Liming Dai added. 
Elevated move around like Spiderman in walls? perhaps already, but researchers think it is closer to a less thrilling use, including the combination of electrical equipment, because the Nano tube culture are as head of heat and electricity. 
Another application could fall within the scope of the space. 
For the moment, the super heroes must wait. 
The other types of research, including the University of Berkeley, California is a new kleberart. 
In an article in the American Chemical Society the Californian researchers presenting a glue from micro fibers purify the safe as hair by movements on a surface itself from the dust and preserve it always had a perfect liability.
