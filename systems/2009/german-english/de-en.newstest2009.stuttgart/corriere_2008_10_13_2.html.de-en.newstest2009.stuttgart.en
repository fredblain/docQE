Of the 55 year-old Krugman is a neokeynesianer who taught at the University of Princeton and known for his frequent articles for The New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the most critical of the economy and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in an editorial in The New York Times, this second incident is crucial to the history of the United States as the attacks. 
One prediction that did not receive little controversy in response and the economists still years later was proving today but as entirely correct. 
"I am surprised and shocked by how quickly disappeared when the memories of the scandals within the framework of the collapse of Enron or WorldCom, out of the public spotlight are" Krugman said at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi by the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank Krugman is a "economist of value", but also a wanting more with a "very aggressive style, which is directed in particular against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
