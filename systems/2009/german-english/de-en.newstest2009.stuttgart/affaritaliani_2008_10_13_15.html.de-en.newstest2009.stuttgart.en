Obama - the first anti-American president in a statement? 
, a well-known American policy, to be considered with much work lies, as independent wrote: "Barack Obama is the second anti American president. 
The first Jimmy Carter, the decimated by its decision, the US economy and the custom with befeindeten Islamic Relations (and still today as a private man) was ". 
The attacks on Obama are increasingly fierce, particularly now, when the elections are approaching. 
A lady from Miami, wrote in an Internet page: "this person is ambitious. 
Obama is a very smart: he will he received the highest post in a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senator thinks! ". 
In fact, these attacks have, however, not to say much; it is racist attacks and they do not think the question of voters: it will be a good president answer? and then there are the polls; all say that Obama will win with a big margin. 
In this case, too, people are there that speak to the hearts and not their heads. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deep south of the United States has in its written in Editorial: first in the polling booths will we know, to whom the genuine American patriot his voice. 
Here is a mentality of the US coming to light which have been kept hidden up to last. 
"Say what you want, then we will decide, for whom we make our kreuchen, whether for Obama or for McCain." 
The people are there who swear that if Obama wins, we will move out of America. 
Something that we never heard before - only now, when the successes of the black candidate seems so safe. 
At all events, notwithstanding all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 individuals were asked: what mistakes Bush committed during his tenure? 89% responded: the war in Iraq. 
America is changing. 
The nation lost 50,000 in soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the pants back home. 
In Iraq 4 500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack. 
Still, Iraq remains for the majority of the weak point of Bush. 
Anyone who will take his place is facing a huge task.
