The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had revealed themselves some days, to save the chamber of deputies voted against the 700 billion dollar saving package the White House: most of the Americans, and he is more concerned to punish the Wall Street than the economy. 
This confirmed yesterday's edition of The New York Times, which reported that the crisis would divide in the Republican Party that divides in their old and moderate East Coast soul, which favours the national institutions and the business community and those neo-conservative that 'those in Washington "and the financial world hostile faces and particularly in the south and centre of the states to win voters. 
This part of the Party owes his rise V. A. The voice which I mentioned above. 
I have mentioned this example is, however, only a small proportion of the major changes, the Herald's current economic earthquake or even is already affected, not only in the United States, including in the West, and perhaps also be infuriated by this. 
In both states, as well as in Europe the crisis seems to speed up the long feared events which, in these new circumstances, finally adopt the form and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the recent discovery, the extraordinary renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of renationalisation of agriculture. 
Indeed, the crisis is a decline of banks and financial institutions, which have close links to foreign countries and at the same time managing a huge amount of assets in domestic households living in a single state. 
This means an immediate political problem for the government: how to behave towards the families affected, which is also a huge voter mass. 
The crisis is therefore economic global politically, however, it is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems in itself to be pushed aside and lost his speech rights: the obvious evidence of this is provided by the EU, what do we find due to their division into various national and international conflicts, a common path. 
Therefore, all now expect the intrusion of the state of their own; rescue plans, new rules, and V. A. distribution of aid funds: increasingly serious the crisis has been to the United States in the economic situation are just to save their unaided. 
And in addition to the resources you possess the legitimacy to use these: two not to be judgmental conditions - under certain circumstances - to which they can take recourse if no international organisation or market in similar fashion. 
Those new emphasis on the state-owned national element is perfectly compatible with the increasing importance that will be launched very recently in the economy, with a relative cross-pillar sector: the territoriality. 
Paradoxically, it is precisely now, to have occurred as we were so convinced, longest in a networked global empire, in an increasingly sophisticated technology, many of the intangible, that we must see at once, as our future will depend, more and more of the essential material things: water, harvesting and oil. 
These are of course all transported from one place to the rest of the world, are related, but nevertheless extremely with a narrowly circumscribed piece of earth - a territory. 
So anyone who has this kind of territory, is another, who lives in a cash crops, water or by oil free zones, at an advantage. 
I shall now turn to the second novelty, which, however, presupposes a brief digression. 
Anyone who says territory, those governments, those politicians, some leadership says so. 
In this sense the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomenon. 
On the one hand, the awareness of the need for perceived leadership, the need for someone who knows how things are. 
On the other hand, a wave of indignation about the existing leadership, particularly those of the economy, which have proven to be inadequate and full shadow zone is now. 
Finally, there is a deep and far-reaching, and in some ways even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, an impatience, a picture of the futility of, a sense of distance, all on a whole class of managers of Western countries. 
It appears that the belief among large sections of the population to pave the way, that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their ideal world, their way of life, their culture, in the broadest sense of the word, as it were, but whose content is the majority as always stranger and jaded. 
The demand for leadership feeds so below a diverse but powerful movement of the removal of the ruling classes and the traditional political establishment. This manifested itself in unforeseen 'revolt "of the voters and the sudden departure of collective mood swing state in recent times, starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Bavaria and Austria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, the rebellion of American members against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the law in Italy also plays a part). 
One gets the impression that the old elite have, their party, your programme, but also its rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, and some would say its format, always more understanding problems and therefore less representative value with regard to what is nowadays in the lower strata of the West and reinforced by the financial crisis and forced to überdimensionalität. 
In view of all this, it would simply be an exaggeration to speak of 'rebellion of mass ". 
But the eyes wide open to consider is, however, it is not.
