You are what you mitteilst to writers 
To celebrate its tenth birth days Google can genuinely say: that is to be found in the pockets of the people, as well as on their heads in the Sky: You know, where the people have spent their holiday to the professionals they are, and what they moved. 
And this is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, the chief executive officer of Google. 
In the direction of skeptics who are beset with Orwellian nightmare vision, he leaves the pitch: this would ignore the very essence of the Web 2.0. 
In an interview with The Financial Times Schmidt said recently that the main objective of Google is to collect more and more personal data about users and as the original purpose of the company, which they wanted to "give all of the information in the world". 
Schmidt says Google, after ten years, world changing work is still only at the beginning of the information gathering. 
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wants, Google would be able to questions such as "What am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "what does a real job to me?" the answer, however, software programs are not yet in a position to do this, because they do not know enough about the users. 
Not all Internet users are aware that the search term as part of its Internet searching registered, and also the IP address, from where it was, and the visiting side. 
For example, the two years ago introduced "personalized searches' can be allowed to store the visit during his own search and to resort to that later, the hit so later generated a lot more precise, and on the same logic as the so-called 'recommendations', to make the system recommends tailor-made products and services as a result of the previous preferences are based. 
The users wondering what would happen in the event of data abuse - "If you look what I am '- some worried whether the Google data monopolies. 
In most cases, however, it is more likely that the firm represents, potential power that scary, and less the sense of guilt or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rebellion against the force that has for many Internet users of rejection. 
However, it is a proven fact that the search term to be stored, not just passed on the opportunity also to third parties, and that law cases, there is no protection for the personal rights of Internet users. 
A perfect example is was recently the fight against paedophilia in Brazil, in which Google the Brazilian government gave information that has been collected by the community site called Orkut "and even an identification of paedophilia. 
For individual rights concerned users could breathe a sigh of relief yet in May when Google with civil rights organizations EFF drew successfully against the FBI in Court: according to Google in the future with no part of the Constitution cannot be forced to publish information the FBI secretly question. 
(However, the federal government has successfully secured the release of 50,000 webadressen and 1,000 search term referring to the years ago adopted youth protection legislation, however, it was the list of individual users, or whose Web and search term list denied on two months backdated.) 
Google image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to enter their personal data because they fear by using the Google service on the loss of their private sphere, the company scourge of the conservative performing firms due indignation. 
Meanwhile, the American "geek culture" that is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and user unites, the next generation of entrepreneurs "cool" in you, unlike Microsoft's Windows, it is thanks to market leader, although both are battling for the same goal. 
One possible reason for this is that Google requires its users unlike Microsoft no identification code, and its services free of charge, a constantly updated, open source code and programme package to be far more attractive to young people and cool appear when the official practices of the software giant. 
On the other hand, the geek overview of the problematic relationship with the rights of the individual and the Internet's razor-sharp - a relationship that has shifted in recent years thanks to the concept of a "Web 2.0" in den Mittelpunkt. 
The "Web 2.0" is nothing other than about collaborating, i.e. by the addressee left deliberately traces and the available channels of communication, and even if its proportions are individually in different ways, the main problem remains the same, namely to show in public. 
An average young person can manage simultaneously at several community portal his profile - from Facebook on Xanga, this can combine with other services, such as Twitter, or music services like Last.fm, and all this cannot engage in a follow-up system such as friend feed or blip.fm. In addition, they can blog, which represent the latest photo galleries automatically that are geostet on Flickr and Picasa. 
And a number of other cases it proves: looking at the party photos last night's girlfriend soon, with whom her infidelity friend was enjoying having dinner, or of staff redundant because he makes in his blog too honest his anger over the management of companies air, one thing is certain: the word "privacy" was interpreted by now completely new. 
If you have an online life, is what he gives up - as in some way could reword the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth. 
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or circumventing the Google monopoly can gladly do that - as with scroogle, a Toole, the zugreift on the search engine Google, but deliberately leaves no trace. 
Not many people are deliberately not from the Community side, so that they are untraceable, but also the online applications from Google, like text processing and on-screen tools and RSS feeds, deal with alternative version, which are tied to a vast server Park and generate has not been the best possible profiles of users. 
Public opinion is nevertheless diminished until Google shows its true colours. 
With its current value of about $156 billion, the company is even before IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the advertising of AdWords and AdSense threaten the revenue of the advertising agency, and the increasingly rapid introduced services prepared not only Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. 
Critical consideration, however, the worrying against Pole: for example, the group rejected a protest of the staff were completely, after the fees the company's nursery has doubled, but also the management believes the frequent meals of staff is too costly and that all sounds but quite mild against Google in 2006 went off the Chinese government even in the knees and an agreement was in which every dissident hits, extracted, or those who violate the good taste. 
The internal regulations of the group is that no new services are being advertised in advance, but only if this is already available, but the events of the next few months and years could completely change back some powerful: while some believe Google book and magazine scans or archiving projects now assume that the company would have to come to terms as soon as the Supreme Court, others are worried because the system "health", the compilation of a complete health profiles allows using found, doctors and problems. 
And that Google is a genetic database, the fact is the next generation of SCi contents authors the stuff - some "scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian fashion a future in which a man thanks to Google personal data is terrifying nahbar.
