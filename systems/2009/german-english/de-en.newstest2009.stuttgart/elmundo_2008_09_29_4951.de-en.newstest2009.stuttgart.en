With British punctuality, at 5: 40 p.m., around the clock, which was provided for in the programmes, in addition to the presidential hangar at the airport of Benito Juárez de México DF the plane, the Spanish airforce, landed with the Prince of Asturias and fürstin traveled. 
The sun went down, but the Rays were forced to use their hands than sun screens to see the royal couple who got out of the plane. 
Directly in the gangway: the Spanish Embassy and other authority 
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver on the road, whether he knew that the Prince of Asturias and the fürstin visited the town to formalising the official travel.

No, it is the Spaniard, but she lived for a few years here. 
Oh so very well 
But the Mexican press quite knows exactly who is the Prince and the fürstin of Asturias and know the importance of travel. 
It is many who wait in a hangar at the airport and on the red carpet, even military protection of 27 soldiers of the Navy, the honorary salvos.
