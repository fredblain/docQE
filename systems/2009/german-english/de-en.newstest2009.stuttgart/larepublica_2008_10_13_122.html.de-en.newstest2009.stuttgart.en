Goodbye to the old Cinema Paradiso - the towns close their historic cinemas 
The historic cinema close due beneficiaries of multiplex cinemas. 
"a town without cinema is a blind city as a face without eyes." 
This image of the film director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect as now in the major urban centres, Italy, and in the provinces, that happens. 
The process of exclusion of cinema, which began with the birth of the big multinationals Hall complex in the periphery, which means for the long term, the death of the einsaalkino Center. A process that seems not only inescapable and irrevocable, but also a cultural crime. 
Affected mostly historical sites are full of memories, "is to lose as a friend, travelled on the roads has a bit of emotion," the director of the film 'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso ", which gave him 20 years ago, the Oscar and the big prize at Cannes; it is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, what it is to live in a good forever lost cinema world. 
The figures which the organisation known as ANEC, the key industry association provides are clear: in the last five years the enormous quantities of 316 traditional cinemas have had to reach; this bill will pay the lion's share of the cinema in large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Rome and Naples, Bologna, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
One of the regions most affected by the Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinema, followed by Tuscany belong with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinema, because it is precisely these three regions in which registered the biggest number of modern cinema was: with 195 in the last five years the Lombardy led the list, 81 are both in Tuscany and in Emilia Romagna. 
"Business has evolved into an irrational way," Paolo protti, the President of the organisation known as ANEC, "it is useful that new structures, but first and foremost, the preservation of already existing, for a house in the city, not all his tribal clients is ready to go, rather than the old a multiplex cinema in the periphery. 
And there is still the lack of resources allocated to the fund the industry association remains äußer eight: the state recorded debt totals approximately EUR 10 million. 
It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral position that the government had not followed the existing laws. 
To keep the sector, aged between 16 and 18 million euros would be a year of famine ". 
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has adopted because of fears about the old cinema to protect this by means of an agreement between the Community and the organisation known as ANEC; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect the traditional movie and to support both in the historic centre, as well as in the periphery. 
Among the anticipated measures also fiscal before Partition are its for the cinema operators and advantages for the public in terms of transport: it will be allowed to travel to the traffic limited areas to the centre and to park in addition to cheaper parking charges. 
"It is a very welcome initiative," Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and design also add new concept. 
To be sure, but we need to tailor a better audio and video equipment in order to combat the superpower of the multiplex ballroom something, because the audience for today is ambitious. 
The defense of the traditional movie has been for me, always an important matter: the closure of the "super" of baghiera cinema, where my childhood and youth was the tipping point, which brought me to inaugurate the "Cinema Paradiso" nuovo, even though I had played for 10 years ago with the idea. 
For 25 years, I live in Rome; if I am acknowledging the Rialto or at the Quirinale on the via alliance, where I saw so many different emotions, I try not to hand to the dust covered posters.
