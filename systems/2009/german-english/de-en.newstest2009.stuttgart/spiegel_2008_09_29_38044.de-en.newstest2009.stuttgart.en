Sylvana and the secrets of bento box 
As Sylvana hiltrop, 16, on the first day of the Tachibana high school should present, the girls start to kichern: the German is complete "Kawaii!" 
What does this mean? 
Sylvana knows the words from manganese - in the new exchange lied she spoke of Japan. 
"The first day of school in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Before the entrances I had bammel. 
I live on the margins of Tokyo and go in the direction of Kawasaki 40 minutes by train to Tachibana high school. 
The way I had to find alone, and fortunately I have not gone. 
The starting class seems set to Tachibana not as strict as at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils a tumble from 8 a.m. until starts at Twenty nine a brief meeting round with the teachers' web 'rooms. 
But before the school began, I was on the list to present me. 
I am not the type who is happy to talk to people, even from a class of 40 pupils. 
Because I still had no school uniforms, I have attracted an old rock My host mother, blouse, blue knees assets and black leather shoes. 
In this I have proved to myself in front of the plate and tried to make things right: "Sayonara where she Sylvana... '- I mean Sylvana, come from Germany and have in a week's birthday. 
At the time I was very glad that I had started long before, a good two years to learn the language. 
The 31 girls classmates have getuschelt all gekichert and gewunken and ongoing I have heard the word 'Kawaii. " 
I already knew from my manganese. 
It is one of the vital vocabulary Japanese girls and means' lovely, sweet '. 
Then I am gehuscht quickly at my place. 
The girl next to me has gegrinst fairly widespread, they thought it was an honor that the exchange pupil should be sitting next to her. 
The rest of the day was relatively quiet, but when the gong drowned out, I was almost bombarded the rule of law. 
All the mess talks and kichert and asked me holes in the stomach - it is real hard to understand Japan's English. 
In a break from locating precisely all your Bento. 
My host mother had made me even a lunchbox - this is something other than the vapid German break bread. 
I had Rice with herbs, small WÃ¼rstchen, salad of cucumbers and seaweed, fruits and a kind of meat in the tofu coat. 
Mostly I have not the faintest glimmer of what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
The situation is actually strange and unparalleled taste. 
What is clear is that everything is real leak. 
Well, until the salzig appealed plums, perhaps brrrr! 
The Bento are in Japanese schools not only simple lunch. 
It happens sometimes that a girl to a young a reconstituted itself Bento, which they then particularly elaborate herrichtet, hoping to get to know the young in recess snack. 
I have read in my manganese comic. 
I am curious if I can watch it here. 
'Why Japan?', I asked my friends, when I told you that I will go for a year in Tokyo to school. 
I said then. 
"Because I am now intrigued." 
Finally, I read for years, ideally manganese. 
And I understand the comic and culture is better, I started times, to learn a little Japanese. 
For me it was quite clear that I had to travel at some point here. 
Because I also have a penchant for traditions, customs and traditions. 
And it offers great value. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everyone is so well organised, I have felt content here, has not lost, even if Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen. "
