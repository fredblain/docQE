BSkyB loses complaint in the case of ITV 
BSkyB has his complaint against the decision by the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competitive broadcaster ITV, lost. 
The competition appeals court ordered BSkyB to cut its ITV from 17.9% turnout to below 7.5%. 
Previously the Commission had claimed that the proportion of BSkyB distorts competition and sophistication him an unfair influence on the broadcaster ITV. 
BSkyB acquired its shares in 2006 when he has renamed NTL, now in Virgin Media, from successfully on the purchase of ITV. 
In April 2007, the competition authority has reported that the purchase of shares in ITV by BSkyB prepared doubts about the independence of the ITV what moved the Competition Commission to launch an investigation. 
The Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communications office Ofcom have opposed the purchase. 
BSkyB argues, to reduce the pressure on its shares in ITV to abandon an unreasonable and excessive measure, particularly since BSkyB announced his voting rights.
