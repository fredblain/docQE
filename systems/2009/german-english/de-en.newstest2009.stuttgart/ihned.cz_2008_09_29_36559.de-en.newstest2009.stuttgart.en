However, this is no victory. 
The members of Congress have to negotiate, there was still some details of the agreement, before they are allowed to publish the final version of the bill and put to the vote. 
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated on Monday in the American Congress. 
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on banking and financial services Barney Frank told the Reuters news agency. 
The Senate could be different, according to figures probably vote until at least Wednesday on the plan.

We have clarified our differing views on how a package should look to the stabilization of the market, "the Democrat Nancy Pelosi told the agency Bloomberg. 
You say that it could still on Sunday to a final vote. 
Representatives of the lawmakers met during the night of Sunday with the American Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form. 
This provides a abkauf unsold mortgage assets from financial companies, plunging the financial firms in heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system. 
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will not work and should be used in the market as well. 
We must continue the recovery plan, but I think that we have taken Paulson's goal on ". 
A signal for Asia business 
The global financial crisis also reflected more clearly in the stock markets, which fall considerably. 
The word of the Democratic senators, Harry Reid of Nevada, according to the lawmakers are trying to reach before Sunday in Congress for a final agreement.

So far, but it is not yet clear when both chambers of Congress are set to vote on the bill, also uncertainty about whether the negotiations could not fail at the last minute, but there is still a problem. 
Lawmakers hope it will be adopted in the next few days. 
But the law will still have some changes. 
The aid for the system in some of the overall amount will be divided into two parts. 
The initial 350 billion should be made available to provide, as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for. 
Congress can block but the distribution of the remaining money if he has the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, and another 100 million dollars and subsequently the final 350 billion. 
Bush sees progress in negotiations positively 
The president has a veto in this decision, however, the Congress could vote on its right of veto. 
Despite these changes the basic idea of the programme, is still based, to repay that money for the abkauf bad mortgage-related securities, their value is to win because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer capable of their mortgages. 
"We have drawn up everything. 
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the bill, the Senate and then on Monday, "the Republican Senator Judd Gregg. 
Satisfied with the progress of the American President Bush also shows. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was with progress on Saturday and "The mutual efforts treasures, to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy." 
Restriction golden parachutes 
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator said lawmakers had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of perks and a timetable for the financing of the plan. 
The new law will limit the so-called golden parachute for the director of the companies which are involved in the programs, and set up a committee to which the supervision should fall on the fund. 
The Treasury should guide. 
"We have worked very hard and achieved a great step forward towards an agreement that works and that is good for the market and for all Americans is important," Paulson. 
The plan counts also with an aid to homeowners who are having problems with their mortgage repayments. 
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages, which buys it, with the aim to reduce the monthly costs for the debtor country and to allow them to keep their homes. 
Marek psychological assistance: 
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria finance David Marek a good idea, but the transposition will be very difficult. 
"And because it does not know what mechanism and at what price the troubled assets bought. 
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will distribute losses among themselves ", Marek said this week the server ihned.cz. 
If the plan is approved or the beginning of next week, is following Marek views are not decisive. 
"Much more important is that the members of Congress agree to support the plan and that they adopt him as quickly as possible. 
The psychological importance of agreeing that there will be an adoption is at this moment the most important thing, "said Marek.
