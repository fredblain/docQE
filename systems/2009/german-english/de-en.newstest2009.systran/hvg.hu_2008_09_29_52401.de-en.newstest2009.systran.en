Have believer in less pain? 
The latest research results show that the religious faith works like a kind of “pain killer”, which is already have facilitated the death of catholic martyrs. 
Scientists from the Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: It investigated whether the belief in God will feel the pain of man, announced the British tide “telegraph.” 
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation received 12 every believer and atheist electric shocks, while they studied a picture of the mother of God. 
The results showed the believers could get the most out of the pain. 
By means of a brain Scan technology could even be proven that catholics could activate the part of their brain, which is responsible for the painful adjustment. 
The investigation was first in a research project in which alongside scientists also thinkers and theologians of different sections of the university. 
In seeking the subjects sparkling equipment was put together by the left hand, which gave the electric shocks. 
The participants were asked to focus attention on two paintings: On the one hand, a picture of the mother of God, stripped of Sassoferrato during 17. Century and Leonardo da Vinci's “lady with Hermelin.” 
The researchers hoped that the sight of the virgin Maria under the believers would cause a kind of religious trance, while they elected Vincis picture because it hardly differed and was felt reassured than down from the other painting. 
The trial subjects spent a half-hour each in a MRI scanner and received at this time, a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they either religious or the other paintings should respect. 
Catholics reported them at the sight of the mother of God “in security” would have felt as if they were “umsorgt”, and they would have felt “peace and quiet.” 
During the religious painting they reported about 12% fewer pain, as if they had Leonardos work. 
The psychologist Miguel far iass, who also participated in the attempt, said that it could cause similar impact on other, pictures, working closely with the atheists, you would have the appropriate photo only to find. 
“We would have to find an image that is very positive feelings, such as a mother and a father, so the psychologist. 
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
“Practicing the faith should change our personality, and do it in many cases” Wright. 
After these excellent results remains the only issue that effect would have a Madonna picture Leonardos or other similar painter at the painful adjustment of believers. 
Would the high-quality virgin Maria reach even better results?
