Debate about bilingual education: Education in english-speaking environment 
In this version of the “Education Watch” Bruce Fuller and Support T. Izumi discussing the positions of the candidates for bilingual education. 
Support T. Izumi, leading scientific staff in Kalifoni studies and executive director of the specialist area education sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book “not as well as one thinks: Why the middle class a school selection needs.” 
The Hispanic voters to raise is a difficult task. 
Bar rack's Obama's suggestions about education is a case in point. 
Obama's campaign referred to successfully conclude “the likelihood of afro American and Hispanic students school is lower than with white pupils”, which is right. 
In order to close the performance gap, Obama's education plan recommends a bilingual transition in training for those who learn English only particularly among others. 
The question for Obama is whether his commitment to the bilingual education, which focuses on education in languages other than English is contrary to their interests, reduce the gap in the school performance. 
We take a primary school as an example “Sixth Street Prep” in the eastern Los Angeles. 
The majority of the pupils are Hispanic and come from families with low income. 
More than a third pupils, many of which are only recently in the country, learn English. 
However, in 2008 astonishing 100 students of the fourth class insisted the state review in math at a good level. 
Similarly, surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year in the English review as good were assessed. 
This amazing success has been made in other ways than those who are preferred by Obama. 
The school Sixth Street puts its focus on review and exercise, constant monitoring of the knowledge and an attitude that do not tolerate exceptions. 
Furthermore, the school early practices, after which the training in an english-speaking environment. That is exactly the point that Obama has to consider, so the head mistress Linda Mikels. 
This approach stresses the almost exclusive use of the English language in the technical information. 
She Mikels who rejected the idea of bilingual education, told the school had a remarkable success with a student who had only just before from Mexico. 12 Months later, it has entered the classroom and him longer to see no. 
“It worked,” he said, “it worked for us.” 
Obama would take a school like the “Sixth Street Prep” as a model for other schools in much of Latin - American and other English to learning pupils? 
The performance of the school would make the answer to that question easy, but the educational positions within his own party (national Bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time, the idea of bilingual education) and its own strong support of the bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain. 
While it agrees to the point that immigrants should learn English, it trivialisiert recently the subject of identification that people should stop, concerns about the legislation aimed at “only English” makes itself. 
Instead, he said: “You have to ensure that their child Spanish can”. 
Obama if it really wants to close the performance gap, he is to consider carefully education models that function, instead of her to despise and trivialisieren.
