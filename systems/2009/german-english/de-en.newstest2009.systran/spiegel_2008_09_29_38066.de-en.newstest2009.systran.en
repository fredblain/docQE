The deputy prime minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations were made soon under the direct responsibility of president and prime minister.

“That is not an amnesty for our country. 
The work has begun and there are just in both countries, there is still much to do.” 
The timetable for the construction or change the stadiums, roads, airports, hotels and the two hosts are lagging behind. 
Perhaps the number of European championship-stages from eight to six. 
“We can no longer wasting time. 
We must now working at full speed,” said the Ukrainian federation president Grigorij Surkis. 
“UEFA will keep us keep in mind.” 
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.

The commission had met at the request of sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
It is to act “a serious danger that the PZPN fails, according to the rules,” said Drzewiecki of the Polish PAP news agency. 
“We assured UEFA president Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation will not be at the European championships 2012 suffer.” 
Several first division teams had been sentenced alone in the last season because of tampering with the obligation descent, finally had even the league start to be at short notice.
