The letter, a country entehrtes 
Mr Vic Toews, ex “law” Minister (what irony) in the cabinet Harper was the last summer took the opportunity to say about Louise Arbour it was a “disgrace” for Canada. 
His wife, we do not want to fight for justice and all our admiration to meet with ignominy states as much about the people around the prime minister, as Stephen Parker themselves. 
We are dealing with a government that did not get their in the concentration camp at Guantanamo bay as the only from all the countries concerned compatriot trapped home. 
A government that does not even consider the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when things have passed, accused him. 
The only government, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva convention, their word breaks and a child soldier in inhuman conditions vegetate leaves. 
The only thing that is down to a law parody in order to gauge the fault of the accused. 
Let us remember that above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the combination of the Canadian lawyers call for Omar Khadr home in order to get a fair trial in Canada. 
The government also closes its eyes to the torture: It concerns it little that a young adults will certainly be always mentally broken after so many years of the agony. 
We are not aware of this, but we are witnessing a here just insidious capping of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy”, the word that is now Harper constantly like a flag ahead, and which sounds from his mouth so insignificant. 
So the time in which there is no moral more: You can use a Canadian citizen arbitrarily, torture and to shut down after the discretion of a head of government, supported until now only by the minority (he must include after 14 entirely to the minority…). 
Many voters believe to find their welfare at a party the virtue, law and order preach. But they do not see that this government itself renounced of what the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The scandal, mr. Toews, does not say a lot, or anywhere else.
