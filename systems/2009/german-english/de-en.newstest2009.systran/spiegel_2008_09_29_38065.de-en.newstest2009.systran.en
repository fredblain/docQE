Outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back 
It was a new film promote, said in an interview on private, and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outete their gone by Dennis Quaid as marriage crusher. 
That foams, and strikes back. 
Late rose war at the ex-married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce wearing the two Hollywood performers now an unpleasant dispute with each other for out in public. 
Meg Ryan had spoken in an interview with the US-magazine InStyle last week for the first time on the reasons for the failure of the marriage. “Dennis was long unfaithfully, and that was very painful.” 
The scale of the fraud got to know it only after divorce. 
The cause of the soul striptease was Ryans press work for his new film “Women” are told the story of adultery. 
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his Outing as a breakaway husband was clear: “Enormous” is said to the 54-year old “New York DAILY news” that “Meg ruminates yet again the history of our relationship and umdichtet.” 
It is also “regrettable” that the common 16-year old son Jack is reminded again “publicly of the pain and the revolution, a divorce for every child.” 
While Ryan lives since the divorce alone, Quaid is married and has recently father of twins. 
And so close its statement on the side stroke: “My life is continuing. 
I am glad that I have a wonderful family, that it is in the best way.”
