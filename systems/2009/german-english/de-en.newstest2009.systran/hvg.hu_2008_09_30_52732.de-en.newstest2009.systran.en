Smart car imitates the flight of the bumblebee 
What is the best way for the development of new technologies to accident prevention, not to imitate if the barrier sensors from nature? 
For example, those of bees. 
With the CEATEC in Japan, an astonishing project was presented with Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees in creating new accident of avoiding systems. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo university built steered organic MIME tables system of the type of Nissan BR23C autorobots that from a mini cars, equipped with the characteristics of bees, to support a goal, the development of a system that avoids any clashes. 
In the air each bee forms its own, oval “private sector, which is very similar to our own “shield,” said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR research and development, with the exhibition. 
The compound of the bee which can see in every direction and in a corner of over 300 degrees, plays an important role. 
In order to copy the workings of the compound, the researchers took up the idea of laser-steered distance area finder. 
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, computes its routes and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which opens the collision-avoiding process immediately. 
The barrier is registered in fractions of a second, and the autorobot immediately changed the course, similar to the movement of bees, by turning the tyre on the spot. 
Unlike past systems this ploy purely instinctive will take place. 
“If it would be, the autorobot could not respond quickly enough, around the obstacles to escape,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the “Mobility Laboratory” and the autorobot project. 
The system must respond to instinctive immediately and, since this technology is the home and most vulnerable part of the shield, for a class at present, within the accidents even as inevitable. 
The entire process must reflect the conduct of bees, if they avoid other bees. 
And that must be conducted in a fraction of a second. 
But can be avoided, unlike the bees, not up and down, or diagonally takes place, it can only be two-dimensional, only to turningability of tyre. 
While many opportunities for bees infinitely here openly in order to avoid another bees, the researchers could use of the rotating motion, or and accelerate the deceleration autorobot only. 
The BR23C polymer contains lithium batteries, which are easier and more energy efficient, and therefore a longer life span, than conventional lithium-ion batteries. 
Andoh said it arrives at the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store. 
This equipment must process some inputs per second only and respond to it. 
It does not have to store them, or to produce based on previous exercises an intuitive, logical response, so it is constantly only a handful of KB MEMORY. 
It requires no gigabits and megabyte-heavy MEMORies. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology that will be standard according to Nissan within the next ten years in production. 
Another application could find the technology with the GPS satellite navigation by driving and driving it in such a way to target the driver deliberately around obstacles.
