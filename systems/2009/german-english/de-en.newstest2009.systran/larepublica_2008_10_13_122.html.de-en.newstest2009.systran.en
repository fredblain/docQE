Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the towns close their historic cinemas 
The historic cinemas close due to the beneficiary multiplex cinemas. 
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.” 
The image of the producer Giuseppe Tornatore describes in effect that currently in large urban areas of Italy, and also in the provinces, happens. 
The process of the exclusion of cinemas, with the birth of the great multi-hall complexes in the periphery began, ultimately death chamber for a cinema in the center. A process that does not seem just inevitable and irrevocable, but also has the ability to a cultural crime. 
Usually historical sites, full of memories, “it will look like a friend to be lost, with whom we have a piece of street full of emotion,” the producer of the film “Cinema Paradiso Nuovo” which brought in 20 years ago Oskar and the high price of Cannes for it. This is the story of a suburb of cinema and his nostalgia composed to live in a world of cinema lost forever. 
The figures, which are the Anec, central trade association, provides a clear language: in the last five years, the huge amount of 316 traditional cinemas to close had; mostly cinemas in the large cities paid this bill: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
The worst affected regions the Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely those three areas where the largest number of these modern cinemas was registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the state Lombardy lists 81 are both in Tuscany and Emilia Romagna. 
“The business has in an irrational way developed” that Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, “it is useful for new structures, but in the first place is the preservation of the existing already because fills a warehouse in the city, is not all its regular customers to visit in place of an old multiplex cinema in the periphery. 
And even the lack of budget for the fund of trade association remains outside eight: the debt burden recorded by the state amounted to approximately 10 million. 
It is a shame ethical-moral from the position that the government does not consider the existing laws. 
In order to preserve the sector would be between 16 and 18 million in the year of emergencies.” 
The case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which decided because of fears for the old cinemas to protect these by an agreement between the community and the Anec is interesting; this is the first of its kind in Italy, which seeks to protect and support the traditional cinemas, both in the historic center, and in the periphery. 
Under the anticipated tax measures to give preference to the cinema operators and benefits to the public are on the transport: it will be allowed to go into the traffic-limited areas of central and also park to better parking fees. 
“It is a good initiative” Giuseppe Tornatore, “I hope that our other towns, and will be followed by a new approaches to elaborate beyond that. 
But there is no doubt that we need a better audio and video equipment, in order to be able to concentrate on the superpower the multiplex halls, because the public is now more ambitious. 
Defending the traditional cinema was always for me an important issue: the closure of the “Supercinema” of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the key point, which brought me to create the “Nuovo cinema Paradiso” even if I had already played for 10 years with the idea. 
For 25 years I live in Rome; if I pass at the Rialto or at the Quirinale through in the Alliance, where I have seen so many different emotions, turning to the side, so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
