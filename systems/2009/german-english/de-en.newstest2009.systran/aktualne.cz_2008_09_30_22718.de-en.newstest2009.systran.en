Questions about the accident. Stewards are illegal in the bus? 
The law does not know it, in a remote coach is not allowed to run 
In connection with the tragic accident involving a bus in society student Representation in the vicinity of the Italian Padua, the question is whether stewards and passengers can go back and forth while driving in the bus. 
“We wanted to keep strictly and formally the legislation, the work of a stewards contradicts the law on the road,” a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, which last week a twenty-two-year old hostess died, was probably caused by the driver of the Trucks, which crossed the bus. 
The young woman sat at the time of the accident, next to the driver, at least the safe place in the car, although she had two other positions. 
However, a bus or may have sharply brake at the moment an accident in which the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers. 
A role, whether the bus vehicle registration is equipped with standing rooms after another. 
If this is not included in the bus passengers must sit. 
The remote coaches of student Agency have no standing rooms; the director of the company, confirmed Radim Jančura, opposite Aktuálně.cz. 
“We discussed this with the Ministry, and it did not agree with the movement of passengers. 
Later, they took it back, and we have reached a consensus that passengers can go while driving on the toilet, if they have their headquarters”, he told his position. 
The law does not know a steward 
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a stewards, no legislation describes this role. 
However, there is no law, which forbids the winner to provide services. 
The law on the transport knows only the concept vehicle companion; his rights and obligations, but it is not acceptable”, a spokesman for the Ministry Hanzelka clearly. 
The director of the department of transport vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný but means that the law later covers this problem. 
“It depends on whether the bus in the product approval has also standing rooms. 
That is all,” he stressed. 
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing rooms and the maximum speed is limited, transport buses with standing rooms and a higher allowed speed and remote coaches without standing rooms with the highest permitted speed and seats, which are equipped with safety belts. 
As the plane, expert says 
The BESIP specialist for road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of stewards aboard a bus. 
“With a liquid driving fashion many risks, the situation will not threaten are similar to the service on board a plane. 
Is not safe again when turbulence, and the hostess can override the head.” 
“But a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics. 
Just as in the city bus or in a tram. 
The security of the stewards to clarify the winner by internal rules,” says it and also means that this problem from the point of view of the law is not completely resolved. 
Jančura is prepared to remove the services 
Student Agency provides services of stewards as the only bus company. 
The company employs about two hundred people in this job. 
The director does not consider his career after the accident as risk pregnant. 
“As soon as I get the impression that the occupation of the stewards risk is pregnant, I will remove. 
Coffee and newspapers can receive when passengers arriving. 
That would lower, means” the costs. 
As interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in his buses. His company has only a fraction of the lines in comparison with student Agency. 
“We do not have hostesses, on the other hand, we are right from the start. 
Sooner or later this ends with a fatal accident,” it a year ago for Týden.cz had not fully said. 
That was an enormous tragedy 
In the crash of a bus to Naples a young hostess from the region Pilsen had had an accident, who had worked for two years to society. 
The slovene truck was bent and had blocked the trip to the bus without probably flash from standing tyre. 
The driver of the bus tried to escape from a sharp manoeuvring clashed with the right front part of the truck. 
The fact that the two places for the stewards were sold denies Jančura. 
“These bodies can not be reserved for remote links, they are blocked.” 
The company wants to sue Truck drivers. 
With a compensation for the families of the young woman, the agency for the court decision not to wait a financial compensation expects it but also on the part of the blame. 
A law change? 
Not in sight 
A more detailed regulation of the movement of stewards aboard a bus could bring a legal system, in which a thirty-member expert panel of the Ministry of Transport is already working for over a year. 
“But even arrived at no definite conclusion. 
Buses are not completely on the agenda, but the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones during the trip” for specialist Hořín. 
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards as something that could endanger the safety of passengers significantly” so Hanzelka, taking control of the security of the buses lies in the authority of the police and the industrial safety authorities.
