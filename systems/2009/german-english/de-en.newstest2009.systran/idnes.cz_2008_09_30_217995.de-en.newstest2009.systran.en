Duel at knife-edge: MP3-Player against mobile phones. 
We advise you to your election 
While nearly every mobile phones can play MP3-Dateien, still no MP3-Player can telephone. 
So it is, of course, in such a way that it is better to buy only one telephone. 
Despite this, there are plenty of reasons why we should add to its own player. 
The choice is completely dependent on the nature of the use and the future owner. 
It is certainly not buy at home for a mad expensive record player in order to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
Once such musical novelties seem not to LP and qualitative because there is no objective reason for it. 
But if you LP with kind have rock, jazz and Blues on the shelf, probably dream of at least one. 
It is also the music on trips, with compressed music, simplified said, music in the MP3-Format. 
There are to price and quality categories. 
It is perhaps not acceptable to spend on a player eight thousand kroner but also a pink Floyd fan will hardly tolerate headphones for twenty crowns of the market. 
Two extremes, among whom there are enough to each area. 
The choice is wide. 
The life of the batteries is crucial. 
Some good Music players can play much more than music, but they do not even create what mobile phones can do suggestively. 
No modern equipment to be used as universal as the telephone. 
Besides the primary functions, telephone and that windscreen frame sections, can it music and video shows, both include, it has a better times a worse camera and could perhaps navigate. 
And if there is still the Smartphons and communicators, there is almost a small computer in the bag. 
It is a small miracle because no refrigerator can photograph crickets and no television. 
But the universality of mobile phones will also bring disadvantages. 
The benefits, will have the more you more functions you on your mobile phone but reload. 
And playing music is one of the biggest Energiefresser. 
Only a few mobile phones can play music more than ten twelve hours, mostly are much less. 
In this regard, Music players (special easiest) are much more efficient. 
So you should count on the cheap mobile phones that they can not play more than a few hours of music. 
If you still telephone now and then, bought for security rather than a battery charger for the post - applies even more expensive equipment. 
With MP3-Playern you will not tolerate the less good this problem at least 9 hours of continuous company with a trademark loading. 
Another problem is when you want to overact music on the mobile phone. 
Unfortunately, only a small part of the equipment has an USB conclusion, but each mobile phone without special software can not be directly linked to a PC. 
Of course we can overact music directly on a storage medium, but few card readers will be finished with no reduction in the tiny memory cards, which are used in mobile phones. 
With players, you do not need special software except for exemptions (iPod). 
They need to feed the equipment only on USB haven with music from your PC. 
The most mobile phones and players even put on a music regulatorily library, according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the category or, for example, the assessment by users. 
Some equipment illustrate the tree structure of the list, such as the Windows Explorer, some can both (more iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
Players are easier to use mobile phones can more 
With the selection of specific equipment, you should ask especially after the life span of accumulator, storage capacity, the quality and the type of noise and, of course, the control of comfort. 
If music is above all façade for you, and if you hear it every day only briefly, for example in the tram, reaches a mobile phone, which plays MP3-Dateien. 
What really knows almost every mobile phone. 
They do not have to control, especially, a mobile phone or a player who music formats can process. 
MP3 create all, and most music that you get, will be especially this format. 
The format was one of the most common, and most devices also music in the WMA format can play. 
AAC (a format that Apple use and iPods) is less than usual. 
More mobile phones are also the purchase of music for online. 
One need only to call on mobiles Internet the pages of a provider (or another supplier), and already you can buy a song or an album. 
This service can already be in itself a blatant argument for why we should add a music mobile phone. 
Unfortunately, it is bad supply of providers and is usually only limited to move in quickly radio. 
The prices are not even the lowest. 
Generally, however, it is expected that this kind of sales of music (it is on Internet GSM, or wireless Internet) will control in the future the music industry. 
Most of the mobile phone. 
If you want to listen to achieve a mobile phone in the jacket pocket, while the player is forgotten at home. 
It depends on whether you always wearing headphones or at least a wireless free speech mechanism. 
If not, you can use the integrated loudspeaker that almost every mobile phones, but only a few MP3-Player has. 
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music mobile phones will be for many in the price. 
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand crowns. 
For three or four thousand kroner you have already quite decent Walkman. 
The biggest handicap will be for most that no proper headphones are there. 
The best and most technologically advanced phones with a normal 3,5-mm-Öffnung headphones cost up to fifteenth out ending crowns. 
The advantage of the players is again in the easy operation. 
Anyone can really serve the simplest and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - players. 
A minimum of works, the similarity during the operation with earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or, for example, the record player is obvious. 
No collision in form one threatens mistakenly employees of mobile Internet and then a horrendous bill for communications. 
For the equipment they should do now 
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a Slot for interchangeable storage media (type microSD M2, etc.). 
Even if you buy a card but two thousand crowns are sufficient. 
But attention. 
With the basic models usually only cards with a maximum capacity are supported by 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive too can read 8-GB-Speicherkarten. 
If you want to have a mobile phone and to buy a cheap MP3-Player, then you have to Cowon, Creativ, Sony and Samsung, Emgeton or more iriver. 
Depending on their capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put any more than 1100 kronor on the table. 
If you are among the more ambitious listeners, take more specialized mobile phones, Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent operating knobs for MP3, and the control of comfort approaches to individual MP3-Players. 
Here is the furthest Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phone from the series Walkman has the same user interface as the MP3-Player sold separately. 
The same services at the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long accumulator life-span (normally 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours) MP3-Player manufacturers' abovementioned carries out for you.
