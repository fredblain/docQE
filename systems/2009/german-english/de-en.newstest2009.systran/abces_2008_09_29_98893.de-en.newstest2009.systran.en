“Sangre de mayo”: Hero book of Garci 
Inspired by “Episodios Nacionales” of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in “Sangre de mayo” represents a new version of the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the french. That is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with about 15 million euro investment for the shootings. 
In this way the Cineast has tried “a lot of people and social analysis to represent” what it always admired the works of the famous novelist, today Carci said at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the start of a long list of performers. 
“Sangre de mayo” with a film length of more than two and a half hours, was presented and shown later on the station Telemadrid than a four-hour mini series this Friday in cinemas. 
José Luis Garci, a big fan of the literature of Galdós assures that, thanks to this shooting his “childhood dream” went into compliance. That it owes to Esperanza Aguirre, three years of the autonomous community Madrid assigned to turn a commemorative film on the second century ceremony at 2 November in Madrid. Above all, because the story was based on the basis of “Episodios Nacionales” who accepted the order. 
The overall contribution of 15 million, which was made by the autonomous community Madrid for shootings, offers Garci, he added, “the unique opportunity” by decorations and proper clothing the image of “entangled Spain who chose the wrong leader for the fight, because of the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinands VII behind the people was to represent.” 
But the Cineast that they could not count de Goya” (twice as high as with “Sangre de mayo”) on the financing as with “Alatriste” or “lot fantasmas, regrets that could some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel which Garci worked almost his entire career, not be. 
For this reason, Garci, who was also a director of film in “Volver” A empezar, attended by his usual function: it has on stage at performers, with whom we must first rehearse before it is beginning to look for those who did not Go ahead, it seemed “humiliating” and respect that, “a part of the occupation of the director of the film is to provide assistance in the theatre and the cinema in order to know what the cinema industry, where it is happening.” 
Many performers, whom it discovers de in “Sangre mayo” must go before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Garci, OSCAR candidate in four nominations (from which it won one), believes and assured that none of the three candidates who represent Spain before the Academy OF Hollywood in this year is a younger generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Neither “Sangre de mayo” or “Siete mesas de billar francés” and, ultimately, not the elected film “a lot of girasoles ciegos.” 
For this film Garci does not expect awards. 
“At the beginning you work for descendants, believe later you say that it is only for a prosperous, and you are happy if they produced”, declared a film Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
