TOPIC IMMIGRATION: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS: ITALY IS RACIST ONE? 
Italy, “the former country of immigrants has recently became one of the key countries for immigrants” who are accepted only reluctantly. 
This from the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is the New York Times in a long article devoted entirely and starts from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre born of Burkina Faso on the issue of racism in Italy, a month ago in Milan, was killed after a packet of cookies had been stolen. 
The case shows what calls the Times “paradox of the north”: the northern regions are those in which “most integration and employment opportunities exist,” and “the highest degree of anti-immigrationistischen sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega nord to register are”. 
As confirmation of the growing tension between italy and immigrants, the Times refers to further episodes of intolerance of Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
And not just that. 
The new legislation on immigration and to accelerate the expulsion of illegal immigrants from the Lega, is described as a sign of climate change in Italy. 
A movement, whatever the Pope and the president stress: “Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope during a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between church and state to combat racism.”
