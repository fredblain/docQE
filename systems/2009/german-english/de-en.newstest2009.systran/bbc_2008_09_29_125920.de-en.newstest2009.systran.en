For lost data responsible officials it accuses 
The BBC learned that the cabinet official who had lost strictly confidential documents on a course for June, according to the “public safety law” will be prosecuted. 
The man had delegates from the Ministry of defence, when he lost two highly confidential documents in a train after Waterloo. 
The documents were handed over to the BBC, before they were handed out to the police. 
It is not the weakest indictment within the law and it is a reference to criminal intent. 
BBC defense correspondent Frank gardener said the action for many in Whitehall was a surprise. 
He said: “You would have thought about it at the Ministry of defence and cabinet argued internally.” 
The worker, whose name can not be called, is charged under article 8,1 of the law, the clause that deals with the safe storage of information. 
The royal prosecutors recommended that the official was to blame for his work in the joint Geheimdienstkommitee by the metropolitan police of most sensitive nature. 
The documents, which he moved contained classified assessments on Al-Quaida and the capacity of the Iraqi security forces. 
It has been informed and taken from his home to a place secretly held about the decision on Monday.
