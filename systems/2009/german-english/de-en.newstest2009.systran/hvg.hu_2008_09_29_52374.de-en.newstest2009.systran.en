The psychology of over-bidding, or why we are willing to pay more 
With auctions buyers tend to spend more and to exaggerate the offered for sale. 
Neurologists and economic researchers from the university of New York has now neurological-economic discovering the bases of the well-known and apparently irrational behaviour. 
According to one in the “Science” study want people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, published magazine not beaten to give ourselves and are not prepared to pay even inflated prices. 
The researchers tried to explore the neurological scheme of this “game” with experimental auctions. 
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while others took part in a playful activity, in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were investigated by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). 
With both plays the players money could win, but increased activity Striatum, a complex was measured below the brain crust, with losers of the auction, which the opponent over-bidding plays a major role. 
Apart from many other functions that brain region is responsible for the “self reward” of the nervous system. 
The researchers said, the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of Striatums. 
In order to support their argument, economists in the research group employed additional studies of Nachverfolgung of money. 
In this case, three groups should bid against a partner under different conditions. 
The value of the product was told the monitoring group, then to have its operations. 
Another group 15 dollar reward was promised beyond that, if they emerge as winners from the game. 
The third party received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in case of a lost game. 
The difference between the two groups consisted only of the fact that the emphasis on the one on winning, while the other one was losing. 
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists but the members of the group playing against losing” were for higher deployments willing than those in the control or “profit” group. 
“These results can be derived from a previous economic theory. 
They have watched the attitudes of auctions so far only with joy at winning, or risk prevention. 
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved, thanks to the picture-giving neurological procedures, so that we now have a third statement prepared” Andrew crushed stone, professor of economics faculty of the university of New York.
