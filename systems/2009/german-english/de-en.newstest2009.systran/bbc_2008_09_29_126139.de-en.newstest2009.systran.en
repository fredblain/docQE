BskyB loses appeal in the case ITV 
BskyB has its appeal against the decision by the competition commission to reduce its share of the competitive broadcaster ITV lost. 
The competition court of appeal ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%. 
Before the commission had claimed that the percentage BskyBs distorts competition and makes it possible for an unfair influence on the broadcaster ITV. 
BskyB acquired its share in the year 2006, by relabelling, successfully from buying ITV NTL prevention, now in Virgin Media. 
April 2007 the competition authority reported that sales of the proportion of ITV by BskyB prepared doubts about the independence of the ITV, which led the competition commission to launch an investigation. 
The Virgin boss sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and office for communications Ofcom spoke out against the purchase. 
BskyB argued that the pressure its share of ITV to reduce, is an irrational and excessive measure, especially because BskyB had announced that it wants to give their right to vote.
