Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia 
A Flamencotänzerin from Seville admires a dancer, also from Seville the strain. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: their father was a catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), it was born in the quarter of Triana and as it was three years old, her family moved to London. 
She was a dancer and an expert on eastern danced. 
It was an exciting life, it was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
It was Buddhistin, vegetarian and set for the abolition of the corset that limited free female movement. 
The life of the woman who left its mark on the dance and aesthetics revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón. 
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and her to me this role proposed what i seemed impossible.” 
“We try not to talk about their lives, let us separate their ESPRIT to preserve,” said the Flamencotänzerin. 
Their dance bases helped me a lot in Flamenco. 
“The dance of butterfly” seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or “the dance of the queue like” tango. 
She was dancing sensuous and told me that i told her dancing in this area aesthetic liegt'. 
The production is extraordinary cooperation on two: with Miguel Poveda, which will sing again for Isabel with one of his ideas, as he did it in “La puerta abierta”; and with Flamenco Meisterin Matilde Coral, who wanted to work together, except for one of its ex-pupils. 
'Tórtola Matilde plays a very mature personality. 
I am happy, because she has agreed to participate in my work and I feel very interesting. “ 
The production is counting on musical composition and Gitaristen Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, on the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the Percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa al Viola and cooperation with the actor Juanfra Júarez, “the role of the companion of artists who were Divas, transfers to whom it again and again in love.” 
In this one is in a certain way of life of the woman who in places like India, located as far as we know, the United States or Russia and also in the whole of europe, although it normally lived in London. 
“I wanted to withdraw it, because I believe that it is out of the women, a huge influence on a certain age and their work today, none more so and even less estimate know,” said Bayón. 
The idea is taking place at 20:30 in the theatre Lope de Vega.
