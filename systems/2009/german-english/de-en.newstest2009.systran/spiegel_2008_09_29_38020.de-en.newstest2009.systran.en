Also rats have feelings 
A rat or a cockroach flees with danger is that it is also fear? 
The neuro scientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Too many animals have feelings. 
Just as they were investigating whether the same feeling when they behave as we? 
In the Internet magazine “Edge” are published for several years of contributions of famous scientists. 
Spiegel online presented in a series elected answers to the question “what you believe it to be able to prove without it?” 
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness, unless I or anyone else to show where we could even to prove not to be able to other people have consciousness. 
But in this case we must hope at least, since all human brains are the same basic configuration. 
As soon as we are, however, other species and questions of feeling or generally awareness address we enter hard-to-travel area because the hardware disagrees. 
If a rat is at risk, it is the same as many other animals: It is dead, flees or attacks. 
People are similarly, some scientists close on comparable subjective experience. 
I do not think. 
Two aspects of the brain structure, making it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to of animals. 
On the one hand, almost always the circuits associated with human consciousness close the lateral prefrontal Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the remark/control functions). 
This vast region is much more sophisticated with people than with the other primates and appears with other creatures to be missing. 
At least with those aspects of our awareness to plan and decide which depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among them is the knowledge, who we are, and the ability to think that people are very different from the other primates. 
Another dramatic capacity will be in the linguistic human nature: Since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said, awareness depends on it. 
In this case, it could exclude animals. 
But even if awareness did not depend on language, this would undoubtedly influence them so that animal awareness may also be accounted for, like it, probably a lot of most of our awareness of differences. 
It is difficult to determine how awareness may look to other animals. 
If it is something at home and subjective, neither nor study, let measure because of the special hardware, on the basis of our own experience, with its research before major problems. 
Most of what i refer to the content of deliberate experience, but there are beside it another aspect of awareness, which should be scientifically more easily accessible. 
One could investigate the consciousness of animals without regard to their content, and what happens studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly in the case of visualization. 
But with this approach, Christof cook and Francis Crick followed, it is about the neuralen korrelate awareness as the causal mechanisms. Both must be identical or not. 
Interestingly, it also stresses the importance of the prefrontal Cortex to visualization. 
What is now the feelings? 
I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system is activated like that fear in one of his own work conscious brain. 
What we call “fear” is the mental condition in which we are, if the activity of the system in the brain (or their consequences, how physical reactions) main memories occupies. 
In that sense feelings are closely tied to the regions of the Cortex, what distinguishes primates and especially people. 
Combined with linguistic nature fine gradations of feeling result, because we can distinguish categorize conditions and with the help of the words and grammar, in order to put them together with us to others. 
In contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio means that feelings emerge from more primitive activities in the sense of body parts of the Cortex and the brain stem similar Jaak Pankseep that focuses more on the brain stem. 
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not very much, it may well be involved in genericspreading feelings. 
Purely theoretically can not I disagree with that, but it seems unprovable. 
Pankseep argues, what with rats and people like fear it may seem to feel well in both cases so: But how can you check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave like? 
A cockroach flees at risk if it too scared feels? 
In my eyes mere behaviour resemblance to show no experience equality. 
The neurale compared to help: Rats and people have similar brain cockroaches stems, however, not even a brain. 
But the brain stem is responsible for feelings? 
And even if they could prove to people: How did you want to prove it with rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), feelings. 
But I do not know how I should show. 
And because their feelings (there are different human conscience on specific circuits and investigate based on language), probably significantly from our own I rather emotional attitude than the emotional feelings of rats. 
In any case, signs that progress on the neuralen level when it measures the same with rats and people. 
What I do not investigate language and awareness in rats, including, I do not know yet feelings about whether or not they exist. 
You may find short-sighted, but I prefer to advance to run than standing against a wall. 
I am just a practical emotionalist.
