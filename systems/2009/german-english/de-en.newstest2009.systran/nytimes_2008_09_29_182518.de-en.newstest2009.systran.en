Team record by series in the second quarter aufgestellr 
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought that he would have seen everything after he accumulated in the last eight and a half years more often than anyone in the jet jersey. 
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, in which the jets turned a game without result in a triumph. 
“I did not see,” said something like that ever Ellis. 
After a sloppy game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals who responded to the bad weather, the second quarter began. 
But when Quarterback Brett Favre passport Lavernues arrived with a Coles 12-Yard-Touchdown, that marked the perfect start to one afternoon to its developing cooperation a giant step taken. 
Coles Favre found in this quarter for two Touchdowns, the times as a consultant for the defence slipped and the other a time of 10 seconds before the end of the half. 
“I did not work,” said particularly Coles about the passports to Coles went. 
“He is a superplayer. 
The vote was right, no matter what the people think.” 
While Favre and Coles catch played, the defense took Quarterback Kurt Warner apart. 
Advisor to defend Revis Darrelle intercepted a had an accident and turned him a 32-Yard-Touchdown. 
Libero Erik Smith came to a passport and intercepted. 
David Linebacker Bowens provided for a loss of Warner. 
The last ball loss, forced to Bowens, was probably the craziest. 
The Cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds remaining in the game conquered the jets the ball reconquered and Jay Feely, a 20 yard shot for 34 to 0 leadership. 
That was the most points the jets in a quarter had ever made. 
As he was asked to explain the madness answered Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets “the second quarter or the third quarter?” 
To answer both because the jets could reach 21 points in the third quarter too without one, said Mangini: “Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than third. 
A lot of points was within a short time.”
