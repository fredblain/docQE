Sylvana and the secrets of Bento box 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, is to imagine 16, on the first day of school to the Tachibana Highschool, the girls catch on too kichern: The German is total “kawaii”! 
What this means? 
Sylvana knows the word from a gas, in the new exchange that she tells of Japan. 
“The first day of school in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Even before the way to school I had Bammel. 
I live on the fringes of Tokyo toward Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes, the Tachibana Highschool. 
I had to find the way alone, fortunately, I have not got lost. 
Beginning of instruction appears not strictly defined as the Tachibana as at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils roll up after eight o'clock until around twenty nine a brief discussion round begins with the teacher, the “home room.” 
But before school started, I was in turn to me. 
I am not the type who likes to talk to people, especially in a class of 40 pupils. 
Because I have not had a school uniform, I had suffered an old rock of my guest mother, however, blue blouse knee socks and black leather shoes. 
In the elevator I asked myself and therefore tried before the desk to make everything properly: “Sayonara where she Sylvana…” I hot Sylvana, come from Germany and have in one week birthday. 
At the moment, I was very pleased that I had already begun before over two years to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class gossiped secretly, and gekichert gewunken and I keep the word “Kawaii” all heard. 
I already knew that from my one gas. 
It is a critical vocabulary of Japanese girl and means “nicely, sweetly.” 
I am quickly flitted in my place. 
The girl grinned beside me, i thought it was rather an extensive credit that the exchange student alongside it should sit. 
The rest of the time was more calm, but when the gong sounded, I was stormed outright. 
All the talk in disarray and kicherten and asked me holes in the stomach, genuinly it is difficult to understand Japanese English. 
In the break all their unpacked Bentos. 
My guest mother had made such a Lunchbox for me, that is times something other than desert German break bread. 
I had rice with herbs, small small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. 
I usually do not have a pale embers, what I eat here in Japan. 
Things look strange and taste entirely new. 
What is clear is that all genuinly more delicious. 
Naja, until the salty inserted plums, perhaps brrrr! 
The Bentos is at Japanese schools, not just the lunch. 
Sometimes it is the fact that a girl gives a boy a Bento even prepared, which is preparing her then skilful, particularly in the hope that closer knows the boy with the break snack to learn. 
I was in my Manga comics. 
I am now interested to see if I can also see here. 
“Why calculated Japan? ” my friends asked me when I told them that I want to go for a year in Tokyo to school. 
I always said: 
“Because it fascinates me.” 
Finally, I read a gas for years, most of all. 
And so I the comics and culture in better understand, I also took some time to get a little Japanese. 
For me, it was clear that I had to travel at some point here. 
Because I have a Faible for traditions, habits and customs. 
And it is a great value. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strictly, disciplined and traditional. 
And because it is so well organized, I did not feel here yet lost, even if Tokyo is the largest city where I ever saw.”
