The first virtual supplier is already this year to the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, the Czech providers offers a virtually all services, how they are offered by their partners in Western Europe. 
However, this is not a little, a virtual supplier, forcing the classic to lower prices. 
Perhaps that will no longer be long in coming. 
The Czech mobile phone operators work on the most expensive in Europe, we have often Mobil.cz reported. 
This confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which drew attention to the fact that the price for a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European union. 
After the final stages of the European commission in the adaptation of roaming charges so it is probably a paradox, for some customers of the Czech mobile phone operators SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home. 
How is it that prices are so high in the Czech Republic, compared with Europe? 
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition, which really is a challenge. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxically, in the Czech Republic, there are three mobile networks and the enforcement of more than 100%. 
The mobile phone operators grumble opposed happy about the fact that there is a lot of competition in the Czech market. 
Often, the chairman of the council of the Czech telecommunications authority (ČTÚ) agrees with Pavel Dvořák, which has often expressed in the past that there is no place for another supplier in the Czech Republic. 
It is true that a classic supplier with its own network does not have any more particularly many opportunities (it would probably find little frequencies). 
But there is another possibility, a virtual supplier. 
The access of virtual operators on the mobile phone market has a clear price reduction in itself, including the classic mobile phone operators then had to react. 
There have been similar votes before the access of such companies such as Tesco to mobile or Virgin Mobile market in Britain as in the Czech Republic. 
But it has been shown that there is room for such suppliers and that they can really be successful. 
By the way, you need to look for a long time, for example. 
This February we spoke at the start of the virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland. 
In just six months, managed to this supplier to win more than 100 thousand customers and become in such a way to five-largest supplier of the country. 
Behind the Mobilking Penta- banking association, which stands for US in Czech Republic, among other things. fon has. 
The advantage of virtual providers lies with the fact that we can focus on a much more specific target group. 
In order to be able to operate effectively, virtual providers need much less customers as a classic supplier. 
They need a relatively high costs of the building, the company and maintaining a mobile network. 
In the world, so the virtual providers are normally themselves as Low Cost companies, they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, what is often accompanied by a less extensive service. 
For example, Tesco offers mobile in Britain SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as an example of Mobilking points to Poland, it can also be a good move to put on a plateful not targeted. 
This supplier is directed specifically to men. 
“Real chaps Mobilking - elect the supplier who made them and what they can trust,” David Seibert, the CEO of the mobiles entertainment company, the company of this virtual supplier. 
To say on whether a similar approach could gain in Poland in the Czech Republic. 
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubt: “The Czech market is relatively low for a market segment in which most virtual operators are based. 
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the perspective of service.” 
In the Czech Republic chanceless, mobile phone operators believe 
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone carrier conquers Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking. 
“We are talking about an extension of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not look particularly hopeful. 
It will come to a market access for Mobilking in other countries in the region,” then Jana Studničková, press spokesman for the banking syndicate Penta- says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz. 
Indirectly confirmed that the current mobile phone operators have not been particularly prone to the Czech Republic that idea. 
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything to ensure that any potential competitor. 
Their interest in the launch of a virtual mobile phone carrier shows for a long time the group of GTS Novera who want to take another step towards a real competitor of Telefónica CO2 in corporate clients. 
“We have a strong interest in it, our customers not only fixed network to offer but mobile telecommunications. 
And the sooner, the better. 
On the way we negotiated repeatedly with all the Czech mobile phone operators. 
With some of them we have already achieved negotiation progress”, so the press spokesman for the group of Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps now better times. 
With no official information indicates that the first virtual supplier is to be expected by the end of the year. 
So far, however, it is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. 
“At this moment we do not trust in the Czech Republic held for a full virtual supplier. 
The Czech market has great Specifics compared to other markets. 
So far, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area, means” in its statement on Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press office of Telefónica CO2. 
The specifics of the Czech market continues providers. 
The press spokeswoman von T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the declaration of CO2: “So far we have found no viable and reciprocally favourable project, which could be built.” 
And he adds: “In the network of T-Mobile until the end of the year, barely a virtual supplier will emerge. 
At the moment, we must have a concrete offer to attend to think all short-term.” 
Vodafone is drawing more attention to meet the needs of its own 3G-Lizenz. 
Miroslav Čepický resources: “For negotiations with potential virtual suppliers, we are open, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure. 
We see this from the perspective of the customers as the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a quick mobile Internet.” 
The responsible authorities, with the suppliers hand-in-hand 
The trial of the mobile phone operators is easy to understand, another supplier would mean more competition, this to falling prices and to a drop in profits would lead. 
So why should we make the market access for such a competitor? 
The fact that the operators can work together, if it is something that is also the long back and forth by the emergence of US: fon. 
Perhaps the most pressure toward ČTÚ at present, as US: fon on the market, from society T-Mobile got along. 
The publicly - available information occupied by the ČTÚ websites. 
But now it is suitable American: fon as a reason why we should not allow a virtual supplier. 
Martina Kemrová said: “The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently strengthened by the market access for a fourth mobile phone operator. 
Given the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech republic, it is clear that a new player would make high demands on the market and in particular his services.” 
In light of the actions of the mobile phone operators, however, the absolute lack of interest in the Czech regulators surprises. 
It is not just about the attitude of the ČTÚ who do not have the authority to Czech people unfortunately, in contrast to Britain and other developed countries, to intervene in the economic competition. 
This is only the office for the protection of the economic competition (ÚOHS). 
However, this was a very typical attitude to the entire problem. 
“The market access to a virtual mobile phone carrier would be possible, after it came to a conclusion of a contract, the infrastructure needed between a mobile phone operator and a virtual provider on rent. 
So far, none has concluded that treaty because the offer of potentially interested was probably for the classic suppliers not sufficiently interesting” that in his response to our request Kristián Chalupa of the ministry of foreign - affairs of the ÚOHS. 
Representatives from the providers such wording would not surprising. 
An authority that consumer interests to represent, among other things, it is to ensure that no one is abusing its position in the market, is this more than precarious. 
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: “Abroad, where virtual suppliers working quite normally, it is apparent that its market access contributed to a price reduction cell phone services.” 
But the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction do not belong to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
Almost shocking the agreement of the three mobile phone carrier already touching on this case, which results from their reactions, is real. 
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, is obvious. 
In the same way that absolutely gasoline price resembles the gas stations surely only chance, and the result of a tough competition. 
“The authority did not discover that any signs that point to act against the competition, and therefore has no reason to intervene in some way in the matter. 
Neither the supplier has a dominant market position, so it is not the appropriate greater responsibility for his actions on the market. 
The necessary tools for an opening of the mobile phone market for virtual operators are not likely to the regulatory authority for telecommunications, Chalupa said in his statement. 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious issues. 
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by the ČTÚ, after which telecommunications from the perspective of economic competition is a single market. 
In such a market then, of course, none of the Czech mobile phone operators holds a dominant position. 
Some legal experts, however, offer another aspect of the market access to a virtual supplier has always supported by the network user is necessary. 
And the mobile phone carrier - logically, on its network the monopoly. 
It means that it will take a dominant position in a certain segment. 
Even if you do not go along with this reasoning, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three mobile phone operators are remarkably similar. 
Complaints of a series of interested parties ,including the society said GTS Novera) show that they encounter with negotiations with all providers very similar obstacles. 
The transfer of the responsibility for the ČTÚ is in the telecommunications a perfectly normal trick with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole affair. 
This has been seen in some similar cases. 
Unfortunately, we have not succeeded in getting the recently adopted amendment of the telecommunications law extending the authority of the ČTÚ in terms of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts that it had promised to improve the situation. 
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know that all too well, but they have other interests. 
It is as if no one looks 
A functioning any remains ignored pseudovirtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks. 
There are companies who spend own price lists on mobile telecommunications, which are only partially public. 
Normally it is companies that operate in the area multi-level marketing. 
Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others. 
The price lists of these companies are usually only at chosen one. 
The joke of the matter is that with the company as an operator to traditional corporate customers, which has a large quantity of SIM cards orders. 
As an important customer then it gets special quotes (and other offers). 
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone operators ban a similar accounted for resale. 
“There should be cases that tell you, it is a violation of contract terms with concern, which we will look to” answered Kemrová Martina lead to an end to cooperate with our society to question on this issue. 
However, it is unlikely that it does not get around with the leaders of the mobile phone operators. 
Particularly in the case of the three companies said this may be thousands of customers. 
No operator opposes such a procedure. 
From the activities of these companies to their profits to be neglected does not flow, at the same time, in contrast to the actual virtual providers, not by real official marketing is compromised. 
On possible problems Miroslav Čepický draws attention: “The law allows such kinds of speculation, despite all the services of these companies by only a very small percentage of clients. 
They must also accept that the SIM map does not run in his telephone on their names, so it can fully on it as ordinary customers of the mobile phone operators.” 
Alone, but the ČTÚ would have to occur at least strange. 
In addition, another question for the ÚOHS opens. 
Do the mobile phone operators before such a procedure close their eyes, why they fill out against a virtual provider? 
It is to be added to the fact that the ÚOHS has very strong authority to detect such activities and if it does not want, does not have it with the declaration of the suppliers, you would know nothing themselves and their business conditions that would ban would be met. 
The Czech Republic is not the most expensive longer 
As has repeatedly emphasized in the text, the market access of virtual providers brought a sharp fall in prices in the various services. 
Virtually all countries where virtual providers emerged, the traditional providers tried to prevent whose emergence practically more or less. 
The argument that they were virtually identical, too small, or too much saturated market, problems with the quality of service, and so on. 
In the developed countries but has engaged in these moments regulatory bodies that did not try to protect the interests of the mobile phone operators, but those of their customers. 
If it is formal action or not-formal pressure, they have achieved the first virtual operator developed, and further followed this. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies to throw out the entire case like a hot potato. 
On the basis of our experience, we can not the impression to get rid of this ambiguity is as good as the authority in these cases. 
But we do not throw the gun in the grain. 
If the background is accurate and soon a virtual supplier arises, the Czech mobile phone market will contact may soon. 
If a supplier allows the emergence of a virtual mobile phone operator, the ÚOHS will not stand idly by when it comes to other interested parties to refuse to discriminate against (). 
And the Czechs will not last longer telephone more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
