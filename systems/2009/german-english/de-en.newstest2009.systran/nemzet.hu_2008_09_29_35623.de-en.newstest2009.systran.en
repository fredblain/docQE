In the online edition left populated German news magazine Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his rule of “Bavaria revolution exterminates their fathers.” 
In view of the prestigious political scientist the erosion of the christian social union began long before the sad Beckstein Huber duo his offices took over. 
The Christian-social renewed Bavaria for decades, now the modern people turn away from them. 
The era break is also a problem of the Christian democrats, as well as for Angela Merkel. 
Quite a surprise the disaster of the christian social union did not come, but rather on Sunday in the end what gone, but rather than previously exactly ten years appeared: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party 
As for ten years, 1998, land the CSU with 47,7 percent and crashed here for the first time since the 1950s under the fifty-percent mark 
Repeated itself Stoiber era quoted three years ago with the elections 2005, that is still in the deal. 
The modernization consistently pursued by the CSU in the state wiped out their mothers and fathers at last. 
Sociologists had predicted, but the pace had much verschätzt themselves 40 years ago. But knew without effect secularization, educational success, which does not remain prosperous inlet by east and North German in those regions of Bavaria on the loyalty of the CSU voters. 
Modernisation always comes with option. And it has political consequences. 
The right side is intact, only the voters in the camp became more critical and more self-willed.

The conservative vienna newspaper reports in their “with whom? Party chiefs cool in coalition issues” called articles on the chaotic internal situation in Austria after the new elections. 
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in internal affairs. 
The BZÖ points in all directions open to discussion, while the Greens do not want to commit themselves to a coalition. 
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on the public television, the party chiefs would hardly look into their cards. 
SPÖ boss Werner Faymann reiterated his desire to try to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation of both parties is perfectly possible for real in some states and in the social partnership that is already the case. 
Whether he left himself open a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, which currently ÖVP boss as vice-chancellors, could present Faymann. 
He said the voters would have voted the dish Molterer course. 
A repeat of this would not be eligible. 
Meanwhile, Molterer responded to red offers carefully. 
Cooperation can not be fruitful, it meant when Faymann attempts to interfere in internal requests from the ÖVP. 
If his party is in opposition, or in the coalition, is currently very open, and these issues should be discussed ÖVP internally. 
BZÖ head of Jörg Haider pointed out in all directions. 
“On red to prevent, we are ready to take over government responsibility” so Haider.
