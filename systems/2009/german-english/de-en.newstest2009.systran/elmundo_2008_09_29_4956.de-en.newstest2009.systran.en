“I want to be a young mother; the candidate, I do not worry” 
Their big appearance with her sister, prevented him not to build their own personality. 
Mónica Cruz is delicate, but full enjoyment of life. 
Currently, brothers and sisters Gruz take their new activity in the fashion very seriously. 
For Mónica that is much more than a few rich and beautiful girls who maintain its reputation. 
It was moved in Paris with the promotion of the company Mango, since its establishment and also makes the presentation of the most important contributions in the way that the Spanish fashion house sponsors. 
Compassionately and shyly, winner of the short distance. 
Tell us what you do in Paris. 
I came to the new collection for this autumn/winter season, my sister and I Penélope for Mango designed to present my presentation of the second edition of “Mango Fashion Awards” visited and at the Dinner with Valentinos took credit. 
A very hard work, which is at the same time exciting. 
They work for the Spanish house, which is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango? 
My sister, both as I have the cinema and of the 1960s 1950s fascinated; we find many ideas. 
I would like to go through a city women and see how they are dressed as their clothes to combine, often make it. 
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you have a very diverse woman is not true? 
I believe, but in the end, everything is in these areas and has many similarities. 
Since I was a child, I was excited by the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother to rummage around the dress cabinets of my aunt and see their clothes. 
That was super to be even better than in a recreational park. 
Even later than dancer, I tried to pay attention to the clothing. 
You know, we must dancers so far have our own style in teaching and with the samples in order to look at mirrors and to feel like us well. 
When one shifts actress, if you get the costume, into the real actor role. 
Finally, everything is combined, it is like a lot of respect for the costume designer and professionalism. 
Recently, did you, you have no crisis fall to 30? 
Oh. 
I feel better than ever, than thirty years I feel well. 
I think the woman will come, experience and can live with fewer mistakes. 
I am not afraid because of my biological clock. 
I have made the things that were already low since I, whom I wanted to do and that was very happy home. 
So, you remember to become mother or not? 
For a long time, I know that I will be mother, because that my body and I want to be a young mother; that I want to escape not. 
What is the candidate, because I do not care about me. 
I will make and educate them with a lot of love, very lucky feelings for my children. 
As for the film art, you keep in mind the work, in which you were involved and what was turned last year. 
Exactly the same, and I would like to see they are presented to the public. 
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, is very impatient and jerkily and everyone wants to have at once, which of course not immediately can be. 
I wish that “La are for the first time set última hora” and “EN busca de la tumba de Cristo.” 
Some see as you toppled 
The other day did you seem, will vote on the run with stairs Naomi Campbell that? 
Is good, do not say anything like that. 
It is not so I went on the run stairs, too modeln. 
Naomi Campbell, which I know for some time, and called on London simply invited me to take part in a parade for the charity meeting of the organization “women for a better world” and the clothes, we show. I know that two clothes from our collection of Mango were auctioned to collect money for Naomis NGOS. 
People do not know Naomis good heart. 
Many things are told about it. I, as the person who knows it, would say that they are not right. 
However, I will support this good thing, in which it is involved. 
He asked me to participate in the parade for a noble cause, but if it comes and asked me to do, I will do that. 
In order to support women in the third world, which is also necessary.
