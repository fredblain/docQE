If the energy rose from the waves, suddenly the great accumulate 
It is not drying up on a financial resources that about 70% of the surface of the planet and that only the large energy companies in the world seems to understand. 
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources in all this, and also to show about search giants such as Chevron. 
The possibility of gaining power from the movements of the sea is already considered and tested for 70 years. it is no coincidence that tightened up these studies since the first oil crisis considerably. 
As the price of oil by 1980 vergas one broke in the idea of the sea energy, but now the pressing environmental organizations and the rise in oil prices on new momentum in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves. 
This would be the double energy currently generated by nuclear power plants. 
In addition, the currents and tides would come. 
Basking in the attack. 
The first company, which is now on the sea energy is Enersis who signed a treaty in the year 2005 for the establishment of a power station in northern Portugal. 
As this message appeared it was issued a revolutionary step. 
Two years later, it is now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry, which number power production at the navy. 
“Chevron examines these technologies, known as the spokesman, US giant of business in the Wall Street Journal, and balances the opportunity for us to work out.” 
It is about obtaining permission from the American energy commission that is needed to launch a project off the coast of Alaska. 
This is not a sign that can be underestimated, v. A. considering that just continue to Alaska oil is supported by the united states and president Bush recently put the plans for new drillings. 
Besides Chevron also the companies are Verdant power Inc. from New York and Ocean power from New - Jersey who invest in the new industry; although the details are not known, observers speak of a rising interest. 
Even improvement-worthy technologies. 
Experts are themselves from one another in the departure of finding technology, not least because not yet recent concerns are resolved by environmentalists. 
So far, projects are not like this one in Portugal and Scotland on a small scale and seem any environmental problems that can be taken seriously. 
In order to produce energy, but on a large scale, it requires technologies with far more influence on the environment. 
There are other options: Ocean power about using a system of associated buoys. 
The thrust of the waves, which puts the buoys ups and downs, is implemented in the hangs over pistons and cylinders into hydroelectric pressure. 
That propels a turbine performing a generator. 
The river is sent to it on underwater pipelines to the coast. 
Up to now, there are four planned investments of this kind, which are just waiting for government approval. A portion of the won energy could also serve to military facilities. 
Meanwhile, Verdant power already produces energy for goods department store and a park rubber strip through submarine turbines in the East River in New York. 
The water flows during tides propels the turbines which spits by developing rotating boosts the generator. 
According to Verdant has a long queue waiting for possible clients for the necessary appropriations for these energy sources to use. 
Only the waves, tides. 
A special interest deserves the potential in tides according to the institute for power generation research at present. 
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, tides are better than predictably wind currents, the sun and the waves, and therefore a more reliable energy source. 
The tidal energy is what brought Federal States such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to have 7.5 million dollars in the year 2008 to invest, for 2009 are already scheduled for up to 35 million.
