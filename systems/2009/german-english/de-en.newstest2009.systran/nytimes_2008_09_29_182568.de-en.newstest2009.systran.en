However, it is even experienced taxi drivers and local people in many years difficult to say where There is additional, simply because most have never heard of it. 
This tiny road is in the East Village and runs from the first Street lines between the north and Bowery Second Avenue, without achieving the Second Street. 
They are 30 foot wide and 120 foot long and look more like a dusty lane as after an active used passage route. 
There are no road signs.

During a meeting of the committee for land use of local councils in this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the purchase of the street by building contractor. 
The committee that the road remains in the hands of the city, prefers and for a new plan asked to be presented next month, so Susan Stetzer, the district leaders in the municipal council 3.

Avalon Bay earlier announced that pave and setup to seat small road again, which is meant for a café, among other things, to which the company area lettings would like. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the streets, was made public for the first time during the meeting later this month. 
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it wants to do. 
“The main objective of the Avalon Bay is to be renovated this lapsed lane and made a public meeting place,” he said and added that the city had proposed the sale. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the department for building protection said that it was actually the desire of the city, which stressed road to sell and, to develop the task of the department was the real estate as to administer. 
Compared to its colourful neighbourliness The Bowery, maintain special Place some of its historic impression. 
Some believe that the road got his name in the year 1802, when a large farm, Philip Minthorne belonged among his many children was divided and a narrow strip country was claimed by none. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in the year 2006, opened the Place and the road is undoubtedly at best known as façade for the photo on the Cover of the album “rocks tons of Russia” from Ramones.

The road was full of scrap metal, rag and parts of barrels, Postern, leaves and ropes. 
Some people, including bloggers who write about the gentrification in the East Village, have the idea of selling by additional Place rejected that argument that the public property is modest, as it is to remain open. 
Others praised additional Rather than a rarity - a virtually unchanged cluster of the city, which in peace should be abandoned.

The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: “Additional Place is a small close impasse, even during the day remains bleak and by rusty metal door of the storage rooms, closed at windows and rainwater gutters flying week-old newspapers last marked”. 
With a few exceptions, the road was just as recently as one evening. 
A rat went through the back part of the street, not far from the door, which had previously to CBGB, where a more expensive dress business. 
Graffiti has to be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottles was on the ground not far newspapers discarded by a fresh set of. 
Some passers-by said, they would have thought, but proposed rarely about additional Held that the road could be polished up slightly. 
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the street in its current constitution.
