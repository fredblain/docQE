A name for the sündteure child 
Now the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar of heavy rescue package law, which will have to be used in several stages and the purchase of bad loans from the banks. 
In the first round, half the money should be spent. 
In a meeting which went on Saturday until midnight local time east coast, in the end, the congressional representatives struggled through themselves, announced after debates for several days to reach an agreement on the 700-Milliarden-Dollar heavy rescue package Reuters. 
“We have made,” said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the U.S. congress, and substantial progress, we need to get the agreement only on paper. 
Both presidential candidates supported the compromise on the rescue package, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Finance Minister Henry Paulson meant to the result: The program will show it effective and efficient, but we need to do more. According to Pelosi it would affect rum-tear at the helm of the economy, not the rescue of Wall Street, however. 
The written version of the package was published, was released but no high-altitude flight on the stock exchanges time before the opening of the Asian markets, so that Washington Sunday evening 8 (Central - European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning). 
On Monday, the first of the Lower House to vote on the bill for the strengthening of the economy of 2008, the senate in the series. 
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday evening with Pelosi, and also the white house welcomed the news of the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the night at the progress and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our economy and protect our markets, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the white house. 
The program is different from the original recommendation by the Bush administration, according to which the 700 billion dollars should be spent at once on the purchase lazier, with loans from burdened securities. 
In a first Tranche not more than half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages is to be spent, with 250 immediately available billion, according to the congress will vote as expected on Monday at the Causa. This amount is to be spent on the purchase of credit-burdening, bad securities, and that the president is to decide on further USD 100 billion. 
The program is being investigated by an independent commission, including the president of the Federal Reserve. 
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the congress. 
In the spirit of the law, the Treasury can use a combined tactic: It is at the same time, bad loans, mortgages and charged with mortgages bonds to purchase, or other “toxic” loans. 
The leaders of the Ministry reported that the purchase can take place in an auction, and directly. 
The law allows the companies can look to participate in an insurance scheme in which the Treasury guarantees the worrying resources, and the companies that pay for damage expecting similar charges. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means that 700 billion dollars as emergency aid to the American financial system can be made available, it is important for the purchase of banned substances, their insurance, or prevent a systemic risk, which is caused by the collapse of a larger bank. 
We take the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready for the introduction of the law as soon as it was signed, so Paulson. 
The executives and now banks' ordered guessed in trouble at state aid can count on the fact that his handling mentioned in the overseas Slang in passing “golden handshake” are cut by the government. 
A cut in salaries will exist only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury helps out in each case. 
Cuts is taxed essentially means that if the Ministry purchases in the context of an auction, so “golden handshake” unless the retired bank head into the pension is deported. 
In the case of a direct purchase of bad loans the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that the manager salaries are not excessive. 
The picture also means that the existing golden handshake contracts are not changed, the restrictions only refer to new agreements, so that all the more people to participate in the program. 
This is the first case in American history that cuts are governed by manager salaries by law, comment on the democrats Barney frank, chairman of the finance committee, the measure. 
The state wins equities at the participating banks, so the risk to the taxpayers sinks, since they can also take part as soon as the economy and the savings bank is better. 
The bill provides that the president must present in the next five years, a proposal to congress, as the taxpayers are again to recover their lost money from the financial sector. 
However, there have been on both sides sceptics who expressed their concerns about the plan. 
That is what the American people expect us to the plan is protecting the taxpayers' money under any circumstances, so the California republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
