“I have the framework behind the scene, by their nature to”, Günter brewer, photographer. 
No sales, no frill, no costumes for the appearance. 
To get the nature of the great Flamencotänzer who do and devote themselves to the interpretation without the concentration in a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man. 
On the one hand, artists 
On the other hand, personality 
I look at private lives in these moments that are alien to the public, I know that when I for personality typical gesture that depth of a stolen view or express strength of those who are concerned because they will not enter the stage, can find. 
In its project “Flamenco people” represents the German photographer Günter farmer abwechselungsreiche Theatralik of some production on the stage with singer, dancer and guitarist. From this side it was known for artists just a few. 
With this proposal the photographer creates a special iconography of Flamencodarstellung at different levels. 
The exhibition, which belongs to the schedule for the month of photography of Flamenco, “reflects the importance of Flamenco, which continues to grow from day to day,” says the artist and makes clear that “Flamenco people” 'no man can be, but if you look at the photographs, then the viewer notices that there is not a typical images of artist on the stage. 
Ordinary people on the portraits are artist who are unable to stage passion, sadness, to reach and joy to move the public. 
In order to be able to hold the personality of these artists, you do not have to make photos on the stage. 
Her personality and its nature are in their hearts. 
That was interested in creating an atmosphere that would allow me, with a photo camera the characters of the largest Flamencomeister festzuhalten'. 
Farmer, inspired by the festival “Cante Minas de read”, made up of 1997 on a long journey to host singers, dancers Gitaristen or with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the picture assortment of the camera and the existing material, developed by images reminiscent of traditional photography. 
The application of different stylistic means destroys the traditional base of the picture, modernity and the idea, as the farmer understands Flamenco, are awarded to the picture: “Music with traditional roots, changed and every day surprises”. 
These are not only the dance, singing or the instrumental game, but the personality of the artist, his character, which entices with his art. 
The search for the essential for certain something that can be seen in the form of the hearing, Seins, and was the target of this work, which is presented very soon in the gallery of the El Fotómata. 
Prominent personalities in Flamenco including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others that are among the close range almost seventy artists who were photographed. 
The project has become an anthology of Flamencos as soon as book, with all the portraits of the exhibition, will appear. 
Bauers passion for the portraits led it to resume and as “portraits the veterans of the sport” realize this idea of two years ago once again (“SportARTproject”). 
Although the concepts of the project is different “Flamenco people” then the photographer 'gives it too much i like to host the people they know to learn and me in their lives constitution to shift, it is for a brief moment or a long time. 
I think that in the area of photography the portrait is the most difficult type. 
You meet or discover people, people who do not know sometimes at all, or they leave you for a few minutes alone, in order to be able to make a photo. 
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to do my ideas. “
