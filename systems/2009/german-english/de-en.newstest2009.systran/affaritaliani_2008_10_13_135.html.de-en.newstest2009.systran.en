The united states. The financial collapse has left its mark on journalists: In the newspapers one can feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the “murderer” of the written press. 
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by the PEW Research center on their situation and their mental control in the future. 
Today, nearly all journalists are pessimistic that their future. 
But they did not explain to people responsible for that information about the real concern because of the general credibility. 
They do not feel alone as before. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The 2008 crisis is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed. 
In addition, the major problems come through the cuts in the area, meeting the Newsroom, in which journalists working for making the newspaper. 
This is a problem to be solved, so the interviewten journalists, if one wants to ensure that the traditional journalism, as the great public understands it passes not significantly. 
A clear but complex pessimism meets today the American journalist. 
Six of ten journalists and senior Executive of the written press are of the opinion that the journalism nationally on the wrong way. 
In the local area there is with the Executives even to the 65%. 
Printed vs. broadcasts. 
It is not difficult to journalists to imagine the direction the Web. 
The most important publishing groups to clear the way for the Internet, which is considered the written press by many as the “killer.” 
The “economic pressure” that the journalists, rose by up to 79%. 
The 500 interviewten journalists admitted to want to join the new technology in hope “bring something positive for journalism.” 
The biggest rift is the American journalism today between the editors-in-chief newsroom and reporters who work for it. 
56% of the editors-in-chief nationally are safe, their reporters share their values with them, while there is locally only 23%. 
Some think it has with “security in the work” to do. 
To lose their jobs within three years amount to 47% nationally have the plant manager, fear. 
With the journalists there is 30%. 
The issue of the “safe” work in the team (our “editors,” said D. Talk) is always in the united states a current issue. 
Only 13% of the journalists working under contract. 
In a vast nation, as the united states, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers and magazines, radio and TV-transmitters and Internet service providers, offer employers like it to them, it is a question of take it or leave it in such a way. 
Getting very often very high salaries, the editor of it sometimes only 10000 euros per month can get the editors-in-chief, pensions and insurance premiums. 
As for the holidays, the issue is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after third, in order to achieve after a number of years 15 holiday days. 
But the American journalists will admit, like them, in the course of the year, often “sick”. 
It is a question of climate.
