Discussion of the blood that have again safe 
Hema yesterday Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its creation, and its president, dr. Francine Décary, had to be happy all because Hema Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world. 
And, above all, it regained the confidence of the public, which had been badly shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the donation service of the Canadian red cross were during the 1980s with HIV and hepatitis the C-virus contaminates. 
In light of this tragedy and the dissatisfaction of the public, the government of Canada launched a public, by the judge Horace Krever led investigation, which had the aim to bring to light into the circumstances which led to such a tragedy to prepare and guidelines for February 1994 if another disaster of this kind to prevent. 
While judge Krever still hesitated to issue its report at that time, several provinces have put a committee on the ground, whose aim was to build a new system for the administration of units of blood in Canada. 
In Quebec Gélineau committee met this order. 
After the reports and Gélineau Krever in Canada two blood banks were created. Hema Quebec, responsible for Quebec and Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories. 
'1998 when Hema Quebec started its work, barely 38% of the people had confidence in the unity of blood system in Quebec, remember dr. Décary. 
The situation was disheartening. 
The huge efforts to ensure the security of the units of blood to improve and the work in this area during the next few years, we have the confidence of the public zurückgewonnen', telling them before they stress that proudly now almost 94% percent of the population of quebec Hema confidence in Quebec had early 2008. 
Dr. Décary keeps but knowing that “confidence is something very fragile.” 
Since its inception, at 28 1998 September Hema Quebec acts according to the principle of caution. 
At this time, we have seen the appearance of numerous cases of human variant of mad cow disease in Europe, a new kind of creutzfeldt-jakob disease, telling the woman who holds the line since the creation of 1998. 
'And we did not have any idea about whether the blood will be transferred to the disease. 
It was one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which it uses exclusion measures, if you do not know that, if an illness is progressing slowly, as it is clear that calls by degeneration of the brain, which will inevitably lead to death by creutzfeldt-jakob disease. 
They did not accept donations from people who had not given 1980 more than a month in the united kingdom April 1999. 
Now, a few years ago it was clearly demonstrated that the disease is transmitted through blood. 
So this event showed that the principle of caution that we would use is quite a sense. 
1999 appeared on the market, a much more accurate technology for the detection of HIV: The nucleic acid test (service), which make it possible to prove directly in the blood of donor the appearance of the virus and not the antibody against the virus, as it was in the tests used so far. 
The service has made it to shorten the incubation period those between the time that the people were infected and for that, if the first viruses can be demonstrated by our techniques in blood, explaining the specialists. 
This time could be reduced to a period of less than a week. 
So the risk that certain donors could be infected, without knowing it, and one that is not recognize could not substantially reduced. 
These improvements made it possible to reduce the risk of transfer payments on a blood transfusion in large measure. 
Nowadays, from 12 million people a risk to receive with HIV infected blood. 
', In other words, this means that we would have to distribute 12 million units of blood, before someone was infected with HIV. 
Since Hema Quebec distributes each year between 400.000 and 500.000 units of blood, it would take more than 24 years before it happens when HIV through a unit of blood to transfer. 
I think we can probably feel today, if you get or using a blood transfusion around the health wiederherzustellen', means the management Hema head of Quebec. 
'Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the security of our products. 
One never knows the pathogen can arrive in the system. 
Only last year on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus appeared, which is exactly the same as the west Nile virus transmitted by insects through the blood. 
We must constantly überwachen', continue dr. Décary before they stress that Hema Quebec alongside a safe to provide an adequate supply must make available. 
'The need arises, as the population ages. 
Since the treatments are more aggressive for cancer patients, often need new red blood or blood corpuscles panels. 
Ageing populations also affects the blood donor network, which averaged only 3% belong to donations the appropriate inhabitants of quebec. “ 
Each healthy people aged 18 years or and fairness that meet criteria to every 56 days, to six times a year, blood donations. 
14% Of the people who make their blood, are not accepted, on average, because they are infected with AIDS and malaria, for example, and to a country went where malaria is common, for one year from donations is excluded. 
'With these 3% we manage to an inventory, which meets the needs of the hospitals. 
Lack of reserves are extremely rare. 
But we need to renew the members of the donor network when they are older and no more blood to donate. 
It is difficult to convince the people to donate blood, above all, to keep them and bring it to regular donors. 
Life is now so hectically that you find the time rarely, an hour with blood donation too verbringen', regrets Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars Hema Quebec does not only produce units of blood, but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, used almost exclusively with heavy fire injuries. 
This tissue are under investigation, and worked on frozen, before they are stored temporarily with Hema Quebec, the only public umbilical cord blood bank of quebec administered. 
In the umbilical cord that sooner than biomedical waste was considered, rich blood, which can be used for it is serious diseases, such as leukaemia, to treat on stem cells. 
` Several weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood test, and we plan to develop a year more than thousand. 
“We should start well at the beginning of next year to make it available for transplants, continue to declare dr. Décary who describes this program the umbilical cord blood decline as very popular. 
“Many mothers are believed to have no access to it” because Hema Quebec lack the resources to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals of quebec.
