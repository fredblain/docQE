Dark subject affects flight of space probes 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon when provides for researching bias: Dark subject affects the pace of space probes during so-called Swing through manoeuvres. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein could not vote. 
The space probe “Ulysses” flew almost 18 years in space. 
Because of fuel lines freezing soon you threaten now cooling death. 
Among scientists a mysterious phenomenon is creating confusion, the Swing through anomaly for years. 
By taking a flight tactic of space probes with which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a heavenly bodies, such as the earth. 
So the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The euro-american research probe Cassini Huygens used this physical trick, like the solar probe Ulysses. 
The researchers, but for years surprises: The missiles are not behave 100-percent as one would expect it after the ancient law of gravity. 
Instead, there are irregularities in the pace. 
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower. 
So far the physicists could not explain this effect. 
They baptized it Swing through anomaly. 
Some experts fear that perhaps the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of governed by a curvature of the area could not be entirely correct. 
The American physicist Stephen eagle institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still believes strongly in that Einstein did not mistaken, to explain and seeks a Swing through anomaly assistance from the so-called dark covered the astronomers in space. 
“Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could” that also close by the earth. 
From the existence of the dark subject space researchers know only for ten years. 
From an apparently attractions, whose effect on other heavenly bodies can be observed. 
However, it is quite invisible, so it is sending and reflects an electromagnetic radiation, in particular, no visible light. 
According to the calculations of scientists, the dark subject still account for almost a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
