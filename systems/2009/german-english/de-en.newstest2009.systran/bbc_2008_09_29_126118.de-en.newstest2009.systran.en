Fears for the anti Polio initiative in Afghanistan 
In the latest anti Polio initiative in Afghanistan nearly 200,000 children were not vaccinated because of the violence, which is associated with the Taliban, linked to the United Nations. 
The United Nations held last week in six provinces vaccination campaign. 
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons. 
According to a spokesman for the UN that was the case, despite the promise of the Taliban to attack or hinder the thousands of carrying out the vaccination staff.
