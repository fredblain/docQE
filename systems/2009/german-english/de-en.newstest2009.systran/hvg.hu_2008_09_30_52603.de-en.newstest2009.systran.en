You are, what you say about you 
At the time of its tenth anniversary can join with Google and right to maintain: it is to be found in the pockets of people exactly as over their heads in the sky. They know where people spent their holiday, to go to experts, and that they are moving. 
And that is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one the Google. 
Towards doubters that are plagued by Orwell horror visions, it can do: This is the essence of the Web 2,0 overlooked. 
In an interview with the Financial Times Schmidt said recently that the main purpose of Google was to collect more personal information on users and so the original purpose of the company's move closer, according to which they make “all the details of this world.” 
Schmidt said, Google is after ten years of world-changing work still only at the beginning of the data collection. 
Asked about the status Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he desired, Google would be able to issues like “what I had to do tomorrow?” or “job really suits me?” in response, but software programs are not yet ready as well as they do not know enough about the users. 
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches search words were registered, as well as the IP-addresses, which was found, and that visited sides. 
For example, two years ago, the introduced “Personalized search” permits to store the visitors' its own search process and then go back to so that takes can be generated later many more accurately, and on the same logic, also known as the “Recommendations” is based on the system recommends tailor-made products and services because of the former preferences. 
Wonders users but, as in the case of a data abuse happened,“if you look at what I do” show some worried whether the Google data monopoly. 
It is in most cases, but rather the potential power that work fear exciting, represented by the company, and less guilt feeling or fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or uprising against power that encounter with many Internet Usern rejection. 
But it is a proven fact that the search words are not only stored, but are passed on to starter in the third case, and in these cases of law, there is no protection for the personal rights Internet users. 
A prime example of this was recently the case against paedophilia in Brazil, during his Google of the Brazilian government information, which was compiled by the Gemeinschaftssite called “and” Orkut also made an identification of pedophilias. 
By personal rights procured user could still in Can breathe a sigh of relief when Google has successfully brought together with civil rights organization EFF against the FBI in court: therefore, Google may be forced to continue with no point of the constitution to publish information the FBI in secret. 
(Though the Federal Government successfully reached the publication of 50.000 Web addresses and 1,000 search words with reference to years ago passed the protection of children and adolescents law, but you have become the list the individual users, or their Web search and word list on two months withheld retroactively.) 
Google image of therefore remains controversial: Those who publish their personal data reluctantly, because they fear the loss of their private and privacy by using the Google services, castigate the company with the conservative launching companies rightful indignation. 
Meanwhile, the American “Geek culture”, which is present in many countries and inspired computer fans, activists and user unites, sees the next generation of the “cool entrepreneurs” in them, unlike Microsoft, which is due to Windows market leader, even if they are fighting for the same purpose. 
A possible reason for this is the fact that Google does not call for his Usern unlike Microsoft identification codes and makes its services free of charge, so openly, constantly updated source code and software package appear to be far more attractive, more youthful and cooler, as the official practices of the software giant. 
On the other hand, the Geeks look through the problematic relationship of individual rights and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship that moved in particular in recent years, thanks to the term “Web 2,0”. 
With the “Web 2,0” is it to trace nothing else when around collaboration, talk, the user left deliberately and uses the available channels of communication, and even if the proportions are individually different, the main issue remains the same to show that publicly. 
An average young person can at the same time manage on several community portals his profile, on Facebook Xanga, can this through other services, such as Twitter, or music services as last.fm to link, and can all in a Nachverfolgungssystem such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm eventually merge. They also can lead blogs, which automatically constitute the latest photo galleries are at geoconstant Flickr or Picasa. 
And a number of other exemplary cases shows: With the party photographs of the friend finds out soon, with whom she unfaithful boyfriend distracted himself, or who will lay off workers, because it allows air to his anger in his blog very honest about the management, one thing is certain: The term “confidentiality” has now been entirely new interpreted. 
Who is leading an online life, is what he surrenders from, so roughly one could put the philosophy behind the conduct of today's youth. 
And who is trying to keep a secret or the Google monopoly, can do so, such as with Scroogle intentionally, but no traces of tools, which hits the search engine of Google, leaves. 
Many people do not register deliberately at community sides, so they are not discoverable, however, online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphic RSS tools and fed can deal with alternative versions, which are linked to a huge server parks and do not generate therefore the best performance of the user. 
Public opinion is now to avoid until Google shows its true face. 
With its current value of USD 156 billion company is appropriate for Intel (USD 124 billion) even before IBM (USD 140 billion), or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), advertizing space of AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of the advertizing agencies, and the faster introduced services are not only for Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. 
Critical viewers find but also the disturbing antipols: For example, management of the group rejected a protest by the staff, after the charges of company-owned kindergarten have doubled, said the management, the repeated food supply of the staff is too expensive. All this seems almost mild against Google and has agreed to an agreement in the year 2006 before the Chinese government to its knees, according to which all regime-critical takes, or those who violate the good taste, were filtered. 
The internal regulation of the company is that in advance, no new service is found, but only if it is already available. However, the events in the coming months and years could turn back some strong: While some think of Google magazine paper and CAN or archiving project now accept proportions that the company would have to deal quickly with the supreme Court, are more because of the system “Health” affected others who makes the production of a complete health profile on the basis of findings, doctors and problems. 
And the fact that Google is developing a genetic database, provides for the next generation of Sci Fi authors have real - about “Scroogled” which describes famous novel of Cory Doctorow at best orwellschen manners a future in which people are frightening closable thanks to data obtained from Google.
