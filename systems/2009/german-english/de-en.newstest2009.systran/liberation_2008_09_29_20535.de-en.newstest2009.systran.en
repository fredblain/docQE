“Credit you notice that in Minsk an election took place?” 
Youth and opposition activists demonstrated Sunday at the main square of the belarusian capital in order to reject in advance the results of the parliamentary elections. 
Several hundred belarussians met Sunday evening since closure of the polling stations in the market place in Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections. 
Although no result was announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: “The dictator is to withdraw.” 
Some say that they did not vote at all. “What is that, if they make eh with my voice, what he wants,” says a young person. 
They do not believe that the regime that reflected the foreign observers in the best light, in order to resume negotiations with the EU is prepared to carry out a democratic change. 
The sanctions, including the Nichterteilen visas for 40 senior belarusian personalities and Aufeislegen of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were estimated the observers as clean. 
According to the opposition, they were not there. 
“We have been excluded and our observers were not allowed by the parliamentary committees to participate in the count,” regrets Yuri Potemkin, press spokesman for the union of democratic forces, heterogeneous union of twelve parties. 
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkiewicz, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-european movement, because it is important, who is counting the votes, and that is the executive. 
If members of the opposition strike in parliament, because they were appointed, and not elected. 
But their arrival in the parliament can mean air time on TV, sitting in the regions and parliamentary bills. “ 
The opposition is a duty to intervene in the political game because 'dialogue with the European union must be opened. 
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted, into a crisis, Russia and we do not reform ourselves, we risk, a protectorate of Russia. 
Now, we are independently sein'. 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and cooperation in Europe, which followed the election course of events does not recognize the election. 
He stressed that the turnout figures seem too high and that the expansion of the votes in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) paved the way for any kind of manipulation. 
Credit 'you notice that the election was held? the leader of the Social Democrats asks Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released during August this year. 
In the polling stations were no one. 
And a maximum of five members of the opposition will be in the parliament, those who are most likely to comply with the views of the government. “ 
The silence of the night lowers again on the October. 
On television president Lukachenko and members of the central election commission congratulate themselves to their success.
