The superadhesive that leaves at walls lift-off 
To defeat and walls to climb up the forces of the force of gravity, thanks to an adhesive like Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centre, one of which are now apparently almost at the end. 
With one on a surface adhesive applied to only 2.5 qcm researchers have succeeded in drawing 100 kg heavy senkrechten body on a wall. 
That STUDIO, an American magazine, the results of the researchers at the university of Dayton, Akron, Georgia institute OF Technology and the air Force Research Laboratory published. 
The real invented by the research team is an evolution of the adhesives, which use a special carbon structure, already used, called carbon nano-tubes. 
“We can present the principle of adhesive like a series of a pile of Spaghetti ranked tubes”, declared themselves Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia institute OF Technology in Atlanta. 
Scientists are the feet of the Geckos covered by microscopic villi be inspired by giving a complete halt to the animal. 
The tests with different materials such as glass and teflon sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times higher, as the ability to preserve the feet of reptiles and at the same time, “easily from the wall to leave” Liming Dai, researchers of the faculty for engineering sciences at the university of Dayton. 
AT WALLS ENTLANGWANDERN? “It could be used as a crime,” adhesive Liming Dai rates. 
Currently up-happen in order as Spiderman at walls? Perhaps, but the researchers believe instead of a less exciting use, such as the context of electrical appliances, because the nano-tubes are as leaders of heat and electricity. 
Other areas of operation could fall into the area of space. 
For the moment the superheroes are still waiting. 
The OTHER KIND of RESEARCH, including the university of Berkeley, California, on a new kind of adhesive. 
In an article of the American Chemical Company the California scientists present an adhesive from microfibers like hair by movement on the surface of the dust clean and so perfect liability always intact.
