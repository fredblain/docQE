Finally Illhäusern… 
After a long period of limited circumstances Illhäusern on the pitch is finite success. 
Without much effort erspielten themselves the many people yellow-black gateway opportunities and managed to turn to win and so the game. 
The pace of this meeting, where the attackers had trouble to show their skills was not very high. 
After the first attack on the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot passed close to the spot, Illhäusern easily should dominate the game, and he has managed to only alternating Fonderflick with a remote shot, with a brain high-pass Romain, and with a shot at the tip of the foot to provoke the protection against Denmark. 
The opposing team blocked in the feldmitte and allow only the loud Riahi at the top of the storm. 
The start of the second half should be decisive in the first two by temp-oral Riahi and fought for gate opportunities, and soon after the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais was exactly right to accept a ball, which was rejected in a first attempt by thief old. 
But the illhäusische goal scorer should be able to enjoy a lucky not long ago and twelve minutes later on the bank be sent, and his team comrades were at stake numerically inferior. 
Denmark but did not use this and set illhaeusischen eleven no major problems in which only slightly, withdrew its defense “consolidates”, except in the final seconds of the game in which the ball passed after a big mess very close the slat.
