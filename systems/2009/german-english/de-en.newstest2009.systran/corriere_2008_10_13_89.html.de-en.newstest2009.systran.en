The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had revealed a few days ago, when the chamber of deputies voted against the 700 billion-dollar austerity package of the white house: Much of the Americans was and is more interested to punish Wall Street than the economy to save. 
This confirms the spending of yesterday by the New York Times, which reports of it, like the crisis in the laufschritt republican party shared that divides more and more in its old and moderate East Coast soul that always encouraged the national institutions and business community and that neoconservative, to “those in Washington,” and the financial world hostile and voter wins v. A. in the south and central to the states. 
That part of the party owes its ascent v. A. the voice of what I mentioned above. 
This just mentioned example is now only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even is already: only in the united states, including in the entire west and perhaps even beyond those that they will not be affected. 
In both states and in Europe the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events that accept and come to light in these new conditions finally taking shape. 
The first of these phenomena are the latest discovery, the outrageous Renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of re-nationalization of the economy. 
Indeed, the crisis is a collapse of the banking and financial institutions that close links to the outside world and have a tremendous amount of the fortunes of private households managing at the same time, living in a single state. 
This means a direct political problem for the governments: indeed, as compared to the families concerned to withhold applies, whatever represent a huge mass of voters. 
The crisis is so global economically, politically against it is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism appears to have actually been lagging sidelined and its right to speak have lost: The obvious evidence of this was commissioned by the European Union, which does not know how to find a common way because of its division into different national and international conflicts. 
That is why all now count on the intervention of the state; Rescue plans, new rules, and v. A. distribution of relief funds: Since the crisis has become more serious, the united states in the economic situation will only be saved without foreign aid. 
And apart from the money they have also this legitimacy to use: not so two conditions, under certain circumstances, which can be exaggerated, an international organization or otherwise market will probably be able to draw in a similar manner. 
The new emphasis on the national-national element, moreover, is in complete agreement with the increasingly important, which has recently moved into the economy with one on closest relatives sector in context: the territoriality. 
Paradoxical way is it just now, when we were so convinced, long an interconnected global empire to have entered into an empire of technologies, always differentiated non-material one that we must determine at once, how our future will depend more and more on the main material things: Water, harvest and oil. 
They can certainly be transported across a place at the others in the world, but are still at most associated with a narrow described piece earth, a territory. 
So what has such a territory, is another opposite who lives in a crop yields, waterless or oilfields free zone in the advantage. 
Turning to the second novelty, which requires a brief modules. 
The territory, which says government who says politics, it also Leadership. 
In this sense, the financial crisis appears to produce two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand, there is the awareness of the need for eighth Leaderships, hence the need for anyone who knows how to govern. 
On the other hand, now a wave of indignation insists that the existing leadership, v. A. economics, as inadequate and full black spots appeared. 
In addition, a deep finally more lange and aspect still worrying in some sense: A loss of confidence, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of distance, all together towards a whole class of managers of the western countries. 
It is clear that the conviction in large parts of the population in the way that not only the actions of the social elite, but his idea world, their Way OF Life, their culture are in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is largely as increasingly strange and more traditional. 
The demand for Leadership that feed a tube branched but powerful movement of the withdrawal of the power of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unexpected “revolts” voter and the sudden reversal of the collective heart condition of the last time: beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, on the collapse of the labour party in Britain, for the uprising of the American members against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right here in Italy plays a part). 
One wins the impression that the old elite, their parties, its programs, but its rites, magazines, intellectuals lender, has some people would say its format, more and more understanding problems and thus less representative worth about what is and is strengthened and driven up to about dimensionality from the financial crisis today in the lower social classes of the west. 
In light of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a “uprising of the masses.” 
But the eye to keep a wide open but it is certainly not.
