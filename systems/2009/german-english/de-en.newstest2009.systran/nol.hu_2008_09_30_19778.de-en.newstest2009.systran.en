Lukashenko opposition: 110-0 
With the elections on Sunday, it has created a member of the opposition in the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers believe this is to illegalnesses because of prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, the OECD suspected but during the counting of the votes. 
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections. 
De Legislatur of 10-million-inhabitant state gets along for decades without opposition. However, those expected the other party before the elections, yesterday taken under the name “united democratic forces” (ODS), insisting that Lukashenko, who has renewed his presidential mandate in the elections and negligent, thanks to a constitutional amendment 2006 for the fourth time this time, some members of the opposition in parliament “allow” has become. 
That is why the ODS took away from the boycott planned before. 
Ukraine is economically increasingly dependent, thanks to rising prices for natural gas imports from Russia. To alleviate the price increases even loans were included, and the country also agreed to sell the Beltransgas, the owner of the country's top of the gas pipeline to the Russians. In the context of the expectations of the opposition was the hope that wanted to improve Ukraine their relationship with the European Union, after Lukashenko and other senior politicians have because of than anti-democratic classified political system in the European Union refused entry. 
For a temporary detente analysis of the election of the OECD, which was an emphasis on the positive movements, rather than on the shortcomings, such as only a third of the opposition candidates from the elections. 
But the high-speed report of the OECD has criticized the campaign, so opponents will not occur in the press, and especially the fact that on Monday, the opposition could not be present during the counting of the votes. 
For all that the opposition is able to an improvement in the political system recognizes: Political prisoners were set for instance at large, and Minsk is ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow, by refusing further appreciation of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of south Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia and Ukraine on paper forms a federal state, which considers both areas for a month as an independent. 
“We made two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union started,” said Alexander Milinkevich to our story. 
In view of the opposition candidate for the presidential elections of 2006 a continuation is desirable, although “got the powerful fear, only an opposition in parliament to leave.” 
The opposition does not plan protest actions in light of the results to show tried but rather the need for economic reform to the voters. 
“We have many problems, the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the distribution of obstacles in the way, but that more and more people support the change, however, see even the older,” Milinkevich said in reference to the fact that not even the usually-supported layer of pensionists agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only credit is the production of social security. 
“Thanks to the debt of the country and the rise of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before “social security with-suspecting, according to the silence of a cemetery began to crumble,” so to Milinkevich. 
Unlike the opposition politician Russian observers called the democratic elections. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the commonwealth of independent states Ria Novosti told the press agency: “People believe the deeds, not words.” The absence of the opposition is proof of the maturity of the belarus voters.
