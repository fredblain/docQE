Roma, Alemanno gives the green light to the “commission for the future of the capital” 
Today we start March, should it be over, June balance are held. 
That is the procedures for the work of the “commission for the future of the capital Rome” set by the Capitol. The commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla hot springs. 
In six months, the president's Marzano and the other 49 members of the commission will prepare the leaders in Rome. 
As soon as the project will be completed, the city and the local council will assess the analyses and projects to be able to present in order to be able to June, the strategic plan for Rome with the “official stamp” of the Capitol and the mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
“The commission is totally independent and all political, social and cultural views are represented in it,” - Alemanno stressed. “You proposals for a development plan for Rome will offer, whose political leaders and the city council. 
It is not a redistribution of powers, only the will to have a place where we can build a great project for Rome. 
Their March job will be finished and the commission will again be dissolved, since such project must have a certain end point. 
For June, the mayor announces, we will present the strategic plan, in which we will use the work done by the commission”.

If, as in France, the commission, Attali supplies qualityful results, and this will certainly be in Rome, the case, then their contribution will be fundamental. 
Too often the policy is dealing with the day-to-day issues and concerns that arise from time to time. 
We, on the other hand, are to have a longer period in the face, even in a deeper perspective to the development of Rome and the future of the city of work.” 
The mayor of Rome attaches great importance to determine the following “the commission is neither an ineffective mechanism, another wreck: it is not completely free, Roman citizens a cent and will cost us to thinking. It will make the best heads of the capital. 
According to Alemanno “it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static, to make it possible for our city a jump in quality, which he really needed, and such a step into the future to do.” 
A future, so the mayor of Rome, which are not only limited “the current local borders, but many will continue to look”, not just in the role of Rome metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.”
