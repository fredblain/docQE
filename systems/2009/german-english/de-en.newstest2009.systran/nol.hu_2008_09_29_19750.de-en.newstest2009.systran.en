CSU: Mercy on time 
At the end of October on the fate of the fallen Beckstein Huber Duos deciding 
Despite the election debacle now no heads roll, at which point of the Bavarian CSU personnel debates was postponed. 
Party chief Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is how long the grace period. 
On the fate of the tandem after the disastrous 17-percent ballot loss at the October last weekend with the extraordinary Party Congress is decided. 
The duo much therefore we already see through that it does not want to stick to its Sesseln. 
They want to reassure the angry group and the party lines that after the Bavarian “tsunami” in view of the loss of the absolute majority personal effects demanded a day. 
Five years ago, admitted, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber standing at his career high point, the christian social union reached 60.7 percent. But now, they could provide a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of the votes. 
The CSU was 46 years “Alleinregierer” in Bavaria, which gained 18 percent of germany's Gross Domestic Product. 
The conservatives remain will have in the future to govern the dominant force in the southern state of important for the Hungarian economy, in a coalition. 
The first sign of the party restructuring the potential successors Hubers, also included vice-president and federal Agriculture minister Horst Seehofer into the investigation team that with the liberal FDP, or the “free voter right-wing” exploratory discussions about a possible coalition Munich leads. 
It is an irony of fate that with the list “free voters” that Gabriele Pauli arrives in the legislative period, whose anti Stoiber appearance used Huber Beckstein duo first in order to get rid of the targeted politician ruthless. 
The christian social union leaders are now concentrating all its forces on the strengthening of Beckstein. 
During this transition Stoiber, which held so far, the threads in the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called 28 September “bitterest day of his political career.” 
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic remarks towards the CDU, according to him, the CSU deserved more support from the sister party. 
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and hence at Angela Merkel. 
If the christian social union, which contributed 2005 at national level to success, not in a joint effort the legs to be asked, Merkel can not become the next elections 2009 September chancellor again. 
Merkel, who has made no secret of his disappointment with the fiasco, believes that the terrain loss of the christian social union will not affect the grand coalition in Berlin. 
But it is relative: The wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues. 
With 18,6 percent of the SPD achieved so far, his best result in Bavaria since 1946.
