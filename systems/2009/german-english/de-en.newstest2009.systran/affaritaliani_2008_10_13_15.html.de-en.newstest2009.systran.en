Obama, the first anti-American president? In a statement 
A well-known American politician who close to it, as an independent, wrote: “Barack Obama becomes a second anti american president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, that its decisions, the economy of the united states and decimated by befeindeten Islam maintained relations (and this very day as a private citizen is).” 
The attacks against Obama are becoming more sharply, right now, when the elections approach. 
A woman from Miami wrote in a web page: “This person is full ambitions. 
Obama is very outrageous: he thinks it the highest office of a nation will receive a total of those two black governors and five black senators saw!”. 
In fact, these attacks do not have to say much; this is a racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the electorate: he will be a good president? And then there are the questions; all say that Obama with a big lead will win. 
In this case, there are people who speak with heart and not in the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deep south of the United States, wrote in her in the Editorial: only in the voting booth we will probably know the real American patriot will give its voice to whom. 
A mentality of the united states shows that was followed by lastly hidden. 
“Say what you want, then we will decide, for whom we will make our Kreuchen whether Obama or McCain.” 
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will migrate from America. 
Something that we have never before, but now that the success is sure to black candidate. 
In any case, despite all the considerations, the ultimate weapon for democrats is George Bush. 
1500 People were asked: The mistakes have Bush committed during his term of office? 89% replied: the war in Iraq. 
America changes. 
The nation has lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and with a kick in the back was sent home. 
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have died and the Americans forced to tackle. 
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of the weakness by Bush. 
That will take its place, faces a formidable task.
