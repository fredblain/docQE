Düsseldorfer hopes resting at Frankfurt 
At large said it is not missing in the letter of the WestLB executive committee to the staff of the house. 
It brought in on Monday to become known letters from units Düsseldorfer of bank in Frankfurt Deka bank can “the central capital market house jointly by the bank banking association” arise. 
The WestLB would bring a “authority to block” sustainable yield capacity in such a deal. 
And all this can be a decisive blow to further bundlings in the regional sector. 
So it is when an executive committee wants to demonstrate in difficult time ability to act. 
Because the bruised WestLB still is under enormous pressure. 
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also by the Federal institute for supervision of financial services, which made it clear to the government recently, the time of pressure to find a solution. 
From there, as always, any link between the Deka bank savings bank customers know because of their investment funds, and which is WestLB but for some time, the speech at Frankfurt. 
Deka bank head of Franz Waas let highway with a regional, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, in a merger of the house in Mainz, is familiar with the presentation of the annual figures half of August he no sense. 
But the board of directors of the Deka supported ever half by the regional and the clubs of savings banks, gave the executive committee to lead the WestLB of discussions on joint business activities. 
This could be capital-market operation or parts of it. 
The talks have undoubtedly, it is just beginning with the financial centre. 
From the Deka bank, one of its 3000 staff among the more important employers at the Frankfurt financial centre, is not for the first time to talk about consolidation in the bank sector. 
2003 long it looked at such a time, as if the Deka bank with the regional and the Helaba could fuse. 
From this three-federation whatsoever. 
The plans were hardly be publicly declared itself the government against a part of the Helaba in it. 
The other two houses did not find it to each other. 
The regional Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional baden-württemberg in Stuttgart. 
But it was thought play again and again on a combination of Deka bank with regional. 
But Günther Merl, chairman of the Helaba had spoken out against last planning games on bringing together with his house. 
But the reality is independent mature that moving closer together the various houses of the public sector is needed. 
Now that the election of the past is in Bavaria, linking the BayernLB with the regional could move closer baden-württemberg first. 
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news. 
If the pressure should rise to further mergers, you go out gradually partners for it. 
In the south, it would be more junior partner, although they got through the financial crisis so far, far better than have the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
Once again, the bank and giro centre association hesse Thuringia involved with 85 percent of the Helaba, placed at the beginning of the year, a stop to unite forward with the west LB. 
The north would if necessary remain LB. 
Such geostrategic considerations are only one side. 
On the other side there is the question of how the various business models of the individual homes fit to each other. 
June expressed Merl, which is not a crucial issue that business model, the future of the regional is guaranteed by the German savings bank and giro centre association previously responded. 
In the end the dismantling of the west LB could face, but it certainly desired. 
Like that of the speech, it is certainly a “overall solution” for the house is sought in the letter of the executive committee. 
How can bring about the unifying of individual units with Deka bank, will still be seen.
