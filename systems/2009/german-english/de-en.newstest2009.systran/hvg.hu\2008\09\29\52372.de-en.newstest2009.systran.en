Which produced in the bill factory of also &amp; CO.? 
At 8 negotiations start criminal proceedings against János well and his associates. 
The defendants in particular being involved in organized crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud and other criminal acts, including document forgery, have been charged. 
According to prosecutor funds for their own purposes, lukrierten from the tender, were used, while the services rendered were often filled with fake bills. 
National funds and subsidies for autonomy, a total of 65 million HOOF, are to be partially flowed into the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, in part, to the private health insurance for individuals. 
As the investigating authorities announced, with references advertizing revenue fictitious invoices, and the clubs are not to have followed their obligations. 
According to the indictment, a majority of the bill is to have been rigged. 
The bill blocks were bought, let the round seals at the market by Józsefváros make one in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision on which companies bills are to be issued, has decided to send István Lados north of János also on that tour of the Lake Balaton. 
In the course of this “study tour” Lados should make pensions and restaurants. 
He called on the pits Konsumationen in order to be able to enact based on these documents bills for youth and sports Ministry, the Ministry of labor and social, as well as the autonomy of Budapest. 
These bills are said to have been manipulated by the majority by István Lados and his accomplice, András Őri, the latter is to be responsible for our information on the condition of the reports. 
One of the goals of Lados' “study tour” was a beer restaurant. 
As two of CO and is to be taken in the year 2003 issued bills, catering company is to have the regaled ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
Now, however, the head of the company says that such a large group not at once the restaurant would have set in. 
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 on the foundation labour Jövőért, later known as A Együtt Harmadik Évezredért, were also serious form and substance mistakes. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj which can accommodate than ten people at the same time, only had three rooms and no more, 130 guests are to be under consideration. 
Apparently, just as no limits were drawn to the imagination of the bill counterfeiters, as it is the Pigal Kft. gone, a catering company, whose accounting records of clients jobs and Jövőért Hoppá do not even appear according to prosecutor. 
The secretary-general told Győző hvg.hu Farkas was immediately clear that it was forged documents, when the public prosecutor's office in a survey documents were presented to him. 
“Our company name and the tax numbers have been due to the brand.” 
And further: Apart from formal errors also was wrong that the company was to have held a hundred people, after they have generally eleven rooms, which may offer no place to so many people. 
Also on the bill food supply was quoted in the restaurant is for a long time in business. 
The busy bill counterfeiters also failed to verify that targeted the Budapester taken by offering travel agency exclusively trips abroad, and so it to Hungary trips to the cash payment bill, which also contradicted the accounting practices. 
What is known in the course of the investigation, to have it in addition to the pits the VAT afore-mentioned, although travel services, referring to a country outside the European Union, are mehrwertsteuerfrei. 
The size of the VAT was generally on four of the hotel Révfülöp Kft. the foundation labour Jövőért issued bills, so the company instead of 25, only 15 percent of VAT. charges, but also by the staff exclusively machine bills are issued, the forged documents were handwritten. 
Another mistake that has made the “Rechnungslegern” was that they had indicated the public prosecutor's office in a case “transport of goods” as setup performance, although the company specialized in investment advice is not offered said. 
It was due to further formal errors, false invoice format, false stamp - that at a Együtt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as at XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont issued bills as counterfeiting to be exposed to. 
Also, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó whose secretary-general protested the bills have never been issued. 
A “mistake” is the counterfeiters with HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza occur: It was time (2001) in breaking up when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was to have eaten there, so the trustee in bankrupty indicated the bills have issued. 
Deliberately falsified 
The other group that are bill casual people, he was aware of who they would have to disclose fictitious invoices. 
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták issued the foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the foundation, A Együtt Harmadik Évezredért, at a cost of around 4 million HOOF. 
According to the indictment the Collab Kft. one of the accused, to the issuance of the fictitious invoices persuades Ludovic Györfi. 
It also bio- gate Kft in liquidation. is also well and CO. worked: In the year 2003 is the GmbH foundation labour Jövőért Alapítvány, as well as the clubs and Egyesület Atlasz Vörösfenyő Egyesület in counterfeit bills in the total value of HOOF 5 million have supplied, not setup achievements. 
There was also no exchange, since the bills were removed immediately after the exhibition, which people in their documents forgot to comment. 
The third group that bill-casually includes people who are directly with the defendants. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian of the delta Trió Kft., a resident in Budapest, but not discoverable fuel and vehicle commercial firm. 
The company is to have issued several bills in the period of October until December 2005 on the sale of computer components in the total value of HOOF about 18 million. 
According to investigative powers since 14 September 2005 in liquidation cash current investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas as buyers of these bills worked. 
Of the company was a Romanian, for which the company documents should also be set by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information Kubatov confessed bills on behalf of the GmbH during the investigation. the clubs and Atlasz Hoppá, as well as A Együtt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány have issued and their value. 
The companies company-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the investment Jos Bt. are said to have been created by Romanian bricklayers on Iván Kubatovs express wish. 
In truth, none of these companies were active, which was under accusing because of a lack of contracts. 
However, it could benefit from the companies: To call it, such as his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was awarded the preparation of the formation of a company documents, on behalf of the companies bills to the clubs associated with this in connection with Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
Overall, Kubatov is to have issued 15 bills in the total value of HOOF 14.2 million in the name of the companies' investment funds, delta Trió, company-Bani Jos, investment and Jos Linaxtrade to the organizations. 
The public prosecutor's office expects Kubatov could have taken 10% of the bill sum, as well as the VAT in each case. 
Kubatov is even the company Szi Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices abused, in this case the bills were attached to the applications by Biztos Pont. 
The company and Y-Generáció Szövetség A decaying Magyarországért delivered its applications in 2006 at the non-profit organization of the socialist party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (“TMA”). 
Both received 500,000 Forints each, but these amounts misused. 
In order to conceal this, they have the TMA five fictitious invoices of Works team Kft. . 
These bills were in fact guaranteed in search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Board of Education. 
With the negotiations by some defendants on a commitment by the approach of the bill forging - ahead of the public prosecutor's office has already made, are expected. 
A sensation could be when the principal defendant János also decided to a comprehensive confession. 
His last information was less detailed and, although it had repeatedly promised to report on fully all his confession is pending. 
The question remains whether it is in their interest, whether the socialists signed a pact with him on the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by HOOF 50 million, and whether it is in return, ready to take responsibility. 
However, it is quite possible that now “insulted” games, after their applications were met with moderating the arrest and the house arrest on deaf ears. 
While other criminals who caused and did not recompense these much greater damage with economic crimes, at large, or at least under house arrest, is also denied that option.
