For the Olympic Games the roads are poorly in Madrid. 
However, perhaps, the dream of many of us is to organize some olympic disciplines in Madrid after the failure of 2012 to 2016. 
But I wonder: “We are ready for it?” 
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say that it is not true. 
It was called, and my assessment after that was so perfect street it the worst street with everything and to which gave him. 
A lot of rubbish, if you would consider the evaluation and I could consider it, saying it would not go through something like that. 
However, we go through everything from the outset. 
Nonsense begins with the ticket getting that allows you to go first. 
It does not seem to be bad myself, but if they let go, then they should give you all (including chip to avoid the congestion on the road). 
After all not. 
Here they let you only get the ticket (the first nonsense, which is only going there) and (there after an infinite queue) is the surprise! The T-shirt existed only in the size of “S” (a second nonsense, because I need the crowd XL) 
Where do we live? 
Or is it like that, after the crisis decided only small to buy much cheaper shirts from less material? 
Well, things like these are a small matter compared with the days on the streets. 
Apart from the fact that we have to go very soon to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes, but you have to let the backpack. 
Waiting for more than 35 minutes took what is incomprehensible in the event of a road, where 11,000 people are expected. 
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road began had let our backs bags and we are not even if had succeeded, but to bring back would be even more difficult. 
He also sought to organize in those 40 minutes waiting period as rain, so that it came to the temptation, a popular uprising and attack the little house. 
I believe that morning some 500 people pneumonia will certainly have and some as I do because of this chip, which I have with the expulsion of are not even in time, I can imagine that the outcome was wrongly branded. 
Of course, if you ask me for a perfect road traffic, it would never happen to me. 
So I think we still far from a city will dream, which is well - prepared for the Olympic Games
