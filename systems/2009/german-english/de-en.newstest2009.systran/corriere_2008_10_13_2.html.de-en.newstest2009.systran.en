Nobel prize in economics at Paul Krugman 
The Nobel prize in economics is the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activity. 
The 55 year old Krugman is a neo Keynesian, that at the university of Princeton teaches and known for its regular articles for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of economic and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, had Krugman an editorial in the New York Times said, the second event has been crucial in the history of the united states as the attacks. 
A perspective that did not receive little controversy in response, and the economist still years later they claimed, but today it is absolutely right. 
“I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom from the public attention disappeared,” said Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the executive board of the European central bank is Krugman a “economist of great value”, but also a Banalisierer with a “very aggressive style, particularly draws up against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.”
