Pride and strains in the life of the black population, in a city of particular type 
Hidden among the excesses of the recreational parks in the periphery of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, away, a quiet city is loud and gigantic driving with pride and the complications of American culture Afro show. 
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the hometown Zora Neale Hurstons, are no longer as easy to describe as Hurston it in 1935: “the city with 5 lakes, three croquet posts, 300 brown fur, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison.” 
Today, it is a pilgrim. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and rubin Dee are to the annual Zora! Festival intend to Eatonville around the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance. 
And still remains the city, which describes it, and it to a tourist destination of the outing made by including it in the Florida tour guide produced in times of depression of federal writer project, in many ways a place of the special variety. 
Eatonville is as independent, mother and private as into the 1930ern when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to sharing their true thoughts on the white man “so little about us knows that he did not know what he escapes.” 
Even today, in a year in a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, an open debate about race conditions calls, is that many here still suffering by outsiders to be closely monitored. 
“We are very much on it mindfully like our history are told” so Hortense Jones, 59, from birth at a resident town and community member of the oldest of town. 
It must be right.” 
Eatonville was defined as paradox of Triumph and the fight. 
It is both a historic example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 residents, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the state average. 
It is a focus of the literature and the other is an example, sometimes praised, sometimes condemnation of the black culture of rural south, which has its roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that residents are both proud and on the hat. 
And the doubts really started to really Eatonville's image with Zora, as all Hurston calls here. 
She presented her hometown in books, and were written into dialect of hearts in the world, as “Mules and Men” (1953) and “Their Eyes were watching God” (1973) 
Five sales in the Florida tour guide changed the city, which is very close to the route 77, a road through the often-forgotten center of Florida, leading to the scenes of black history and human tragedy. 
Impudently like Oskar both in real life and in literature, led Hurston reader to load of Eatonvilles first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then more private affairs. 
“Cold on the road to the left,” he wrote, “those brown, white painted modern school, with their alleged gardens and playgrounds, more than ever, the Howard Miller worries, although it is difficult to read and write.” 
She also mentioned the new leader of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn “drinks of any kind and sold as always hourly rooms suits.” 
In just a few hundred words Hurston did so with Eatonville self-government, however, with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was definitely not travel guide. 
Indeed, this was not a portrait, estimated by all. 
“Zora explained things, like it was” so the old 90-year Ella Dinkins, one of the John on the girls' Hurston perpetuated by quoting the men who sang songs on its beauty, full of sexual allusions was. 
He added: “Some people do not like this.” 
One remembers still Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin who returned regularly, after his family had drawn after Jacksonville, Florida. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, thought that if Hurston entered the city gebraust, it usually without warning did, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and trousers dressed in a city that today rather imagines himself on his venerable dress style. 
According to mr. Franklin most residents were fascinated, while many despised them. 
“The people are always happy to see Zora,” said James Franklin. 
But “it is never too long,” he added, but when it in his chair swung, on a terrace located on the rear that looks at the Sabelia lake where Hurston was probably baptized. 
As Hurston in 1960 was poor he died and their books made a mistake. 
Along with the majority of the world's Eatonville seem to have forgotten that. 
Although she was once a famous writer, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at barnard university in 1920ern, was buried in fort Impact, Florida, where he lived in an anonymous graves. 
In Eatonville there was no great ceremony, no public readings on a large scale. 
“I do not think that they understand their contribution to the world or their heritage in the slightest” Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows”, a biography on the Hurston that 2003 have been published. 
The move came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace the Kennedy boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the community. 
Orlan DOS of suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 on the western outskirts of the city. 
The proposal was presented when Eatonville still recovering from a difficult phase in its history. 
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the 1950s against racial hatred compound brought into the community. 
“At this time, often a bunch of white boys and it came threw oranges and things on people who sit down,” said mr. Franklin. 
“There was even once it, a woman was killed. 
They threw a wassermelone from car.” 
In 1955 Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel analyzed the demand of the supreme Court to force integration by revealing its decision in the case Brown against the school council as “insulting instead of my race respect.” 
Residents say today that although the lifting of racial segregation was in some ways positive that the group cooperation in Eatonville and self-confidence of its young people weakened. 
“Black children were used to be embraced, I recall, one embraced his teacher in the morning and they embraced his teacher in the evening,” N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group for the protection of the Eatonville community. 
That may be so long received, he added, teachers and students no longer did not come from the same place. 
“We did not embrace its white teacher, because he was a white teacher, I believe there is a cultural divide,” said ms Nathiri. 
However, the civil rights have contributed to that place for further Zora Neale Hurstons was created, as it did black authors, performers and artists who jumped on themselves on prejudice, with positive self-confidence and statements as: “As someone can refuse to the delight of the society. 
I do not understand it.” 
In the year 1975 was the author Alice Walker nameless tomb towards Hurstons and began to revive her fame to fight. 
Five years later much-vaunted Hurston biography of Robert E was found at the Hemenway bookshelves, and made it a part of the American literature canon. 
The freeway project was precisely at a time when the Eatonvilles most famous daughter once again in the light of the public. 
And Hurstons saw this time old neighbours it as a savior. 
The community has begun to show at 1988 in the planning of a Hurston festival in the district of the construction of the highway was destroyed. 
Thousands of fans arrived at the opening vent two years later, and each January return many for the ceremony. 
Later, the district turned a few years away from its road-building plans. 
“The plans of a five-lane freeway encouraged the city, accelerated with top speed, has attracted real national pride,” said ms Nathiri. 
She Boyd put it more simply: “Zora saved Eatonville.” 
The victory against the freeway project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city. 
Came more and more as course-traveled Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who is here since 1993 into the church, and local people began last estimate again. 
Eatonville was included 1998 to the national historical record. 
A new one-story library (of course, named after Hurston) opened boulevard in 2006 at the again-paved and adorned Kennedy. 
Nowadays Eatonville is still a feature in Florida: it can sometimes feel only 6 miles from the city centre Orlan DOS like a Hintergasse in summer rain, as small as at that time as it of only 27 black families into the 1880ern was based. 
(It is now black to 90%.) 
Prominent in search of history Eatonvilles and its significance with caution are often still treated. 
For most interviews permission before necessary and certain things, as the wall of painting Eatonvilles of oldest church, which has been removed from the whites, and with the agricultural work is black men, to be allowed to be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, like ms Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their shielded community is misunderstood. 
And yet, at the same time, the festival Hurston bigger was born, including a high degree of national pride. 
Mostly young people tend to look like Eatonville Hurston their entire race saw: fine, with all its problems, neither worse or better and equally proud, creative and diligent in a silly and mix as any other race and popular party in America. 
It is a genuine love for this city in which the voice of mr. Franklins can hear nephews, the old 18-year Edwin Harvey, intends to university to Eatonville to return to work in the city administration or at the police, which could do something to help it. 
And even the younger people, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from winter park, learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
“Most people who go only here, will think: “Oh, this city is nothing compared with all the others,” said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after the church. 
“But if we really ends and one moment in its history, it is a very beautiful city.”
