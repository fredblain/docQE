Freedom of expression, the orwellsche speech Barrick gold 
In its spending from 17 September Le Devoir issued a letter from mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-general manager of the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. 
This confirms, and has a orwellsche logic that the largest gold production company in the world has a libel action on six million against three authors and small publishing house without money, with the aim of a “public transparent debate” to open. 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not see the truth, especially in the case of libel actions, but of the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely hidden by mr. Garver. 
As for Barrick gold is to be the best form a public debate on everyone to drive to ruin who dares, one of their opposing views. 
Whatever the process that the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada are large sums of money to spend to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid by the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. 
Tactics with these unequal fighting is often to ruin the defenders in order to force an amicable settlement, which makes the opposite side silence and everyone deters who dares to return to the issue. 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present their views to the general public. 
In contrast, which is common, is that in many countries in which Barrick gold works in Canada debates normally through an exchange of ideas and not by club blows delivered. 
That would have been enough if the gold mine had revealed and had opened a genuine debate its books and documents from the newspapers, media publications and financing of independent inspection teams that could have brought light on this issue. 
But Barrick gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement. 
Perhaps could Mr Garver explain how he can at the same time to please the views of a “public” debate nevertheless and ignore the public? 
Apparently this word in the world of the vice-president only covers the generous paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very good muted aspect of the term. 
In a democracy, even slanderers have to talk about the right. 
What does not understand Barrick gold, or not to understand it, is that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
The public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework, many as toggle complaint term (in the process of “public debate” Barrick gold has a call on the authors of Canada Noir, in which she calls for them, it no longer to use…). 
Besides the surreal Mr Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct attack on freedom for academic research and the truth, which is essential for any democratic society. 
She denied the right to quote and discuss facts and interpretations credible sources that form the basis of the intellectual work. 
If it is impossible, such as Canada in a country to investigate and discuss issues, the rich companies in the world does not like who can do otherwise then? 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public and open debate, it might bring these by following the scientific standards that were used by the authors of Noir Canada. 
It has to answer a right. 
The university environment, to which we have known for a long time, debates and inconsistencies under control and to get to solve conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold clearly shows that, contrary to what exists, has no desire to open debate. 
This is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time that governments take measures that restrict this kind of unwarranted complaints.
