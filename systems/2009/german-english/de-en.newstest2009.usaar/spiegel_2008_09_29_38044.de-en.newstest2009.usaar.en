Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento - box 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce himself on the first school day at the Tachibana Highschool the girl start giggling: The German is totally "kawaii"! 
What means that? 
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas - in the new exchange bonfire it tells about Japan. 
"this first school day in Japan. 
I was annoyed. 
Already before the way to school I had fear. 
I live on the fringe of Tokyo in direction Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the Tachibana Highschool. 
I had to find the way alone, for the luck I did not get lost. 
The teaching beginning does not seem as severe definedly at the Tachibana as with us at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils arrive from 8 p.m., to twenty in front of nine a short meeting round with the teachers begins, this' home room '. 
However before the education began, I was at the series, to introduce me. 
In this case I am not at all for this purpose the model which speaks with pleasure before people who before a class of 40 pupils yet. 
Because I did not have yet any school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my visitor mother, for this purpose blouse, blue knee-length socks and black leather shoes. 
In this lift I positioned myself therefore before the bench and attempted to express everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana.' - I am called Sylvana, come from Germany and have in a week birthday. 
In the moment I was very glad, that I had begun already before good two years ago, to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class whispered all, giggled and gewunken and continuously I have the word "Kawaii" belong. 
I knew that already from my Mangas. 
It appertains to the survival - important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means' sweet, sweeten '. 
Then I darted quickly onto my place. 
The girl next to me grinned quite broad, she found an honour it, that the exchanges between pupils should be next to it. 
The rest of the moment was quite calm, however, when the gong sounded, I was assailed downright. 
All talked durcheinander and giggled and asked me punctures into the gut - in this case it is really heavy to understand Japanese English. 
In the break all their Bentos unpacked then. 
My official mother had made me also such a lunch box - that is once something different than the dull German tracing breads. 
I had rice with herbs and spices, small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. 
Mostly I do not have not got clue, which I eat here in Japan exactly. 
The things look strange and taste completely novel. 
Firmly it is that everything is really delicious. 
'Oh well, up to the saltily pickled plums maybe, brrrr! 
The Bentos are not lunch at Japanese schools only one - times. 
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a young a self prepared Bento that prepares it especially artistic then - in the hope to become acquainted with the boy near the Pausensnack nearer. 
From that I read in my Manga - cartoons. 
I am once tense, whether I can also observe that here. 
'why then it is Japan?', my friends asked to me when I told to them that I want to go into Tokyo to school for a year. 
I always said then: 
"Because it fascinates me now." 
Finally I already for years most with pleasure read Mangas. 
And so that I understand the cartoons and the culture in that better to learn a bit Japanese, I began also sometime. 
For me it was therefore completely clear that I had to travel sometime here. 
Because I also have weak spot for tradition, customs and practices. 
And onto those ones one puts is great value. 
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is severe, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well organized, I felt not lost here also yet even if Tokyo is the biggest city which I ever saw. "
