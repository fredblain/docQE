Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
on this' Emerging Technology Conference ', organizes of WITH, Microsoft presented the progress of the new picture labelling system and the human being communication, to order a being of the artificial intelligence without much intelligence that, however, is capable, it unites to finish primitive work, as such a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft that is a distance designer in order to move on the campus of the company). The system pays attention to what hears it during the conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a form and face identification system, can this' Rezeptionistin 'recognition, how many people are in the area, who they are and who they remind, as they were dressed can listen and the words their entertainment understand. 
It can classify also present into the groups after the talks. 
In the presentation video bemerkt 'this Rezeptionistin' one third person, however she understands that this person to the group that leads conversation with it is not corresponding, and that also no farm workers is. 
She asks about whether the person wants to visit anyone here and answers that she will soon listen. 
All without the blue Screenshot 
impressing 
That is certainly the future. 
Now the company has better things which it can be concentrated on, for example onto the next version of their operating system of Windows. 
This week one talked very superficially about the change of strategy by Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be faster and not have as many bound programs. 
Steve Ballmer found, that if the computer were endowed with the most necessary instead of filling it with the commercial waste so they would function five times more quickly. Human being, stem, that will be only for the Few ones. 
Everything is just a statement if one considers that Microsoft in Windows versions one or other function and 'Extras' add. 
The shift is worthwhile 
The Microsoft has right, the operating system loses importance by degrees, exactly as the software. 
When Google chromium appeared in the network, that was a part of the theory that it is the first step of Google in order to compete with Windows. 
Sent many referred to the browser not being an operating system. 
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will be always necessary so that hardware and software can function simultaneously. 
The operating system fulfills the function which can be compared with the function of his wife or his her husband if it is a question of informing his mother-in-law of something. 
That is right. 
The system will never disappear, however one must at his' death ', not as an absolute, but as relative truth, think. 
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea. 
The people give each time less attention to the operating system, for that more the web browser. 
The computer exports only started, around the Firefox, the Explorer or chromium and every day we spend more time at the surfing, than in the environment this' window '. 
what does the half serve for in the computers of existing applications? 
Little is more 
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista must. 
Easier, not so exaggerated, complicated little. 
The interest of Microsoft exists more in integrating his on-line services that then can become, finally, the alternative to Google. 
In the reality they need that, without doubt. I bring a small example of that. 
I did the photograph of this place in talking - moon in one of the recovery rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. 
on the soft drink machine is a shield attaches: 'your search. Ours future'. A request prints, to use own tool for online search. 
In 2006 an independent study came at the end of, that the 66% of the employees at Microsoft, Google for the research on the network was useful. 
After all, last week was also confirmed, that the new version of the Windows Mobile 7 is guessed in the delay. 
It does not become initially, but at the end of 2009 appear, rather even 2010. 
Microsoft seeks to bring the possibility, Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously on the mark. 
Every day the telephone changes itself in a computer. 
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
