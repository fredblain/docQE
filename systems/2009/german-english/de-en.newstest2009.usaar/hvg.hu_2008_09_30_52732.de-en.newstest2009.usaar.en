Intelligent car copies the flight of the Hummel 
what the best method for the evolution of new technologies for the accident avoidance would be, when not to copy the obstacle sensors from the nature? 
For example the one of the bees. 
At the CEATEC in Japan a startling project was presented, at which the Nissan engineers of bumblebees during the creation were inspired new accident of avoiding systems. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University Nissan built the biomimetic system of the model BR23C controlled by car robots, a mini-car, endowed with the qualities of bees with the aim, to support the evolution of a system that avoids any collisions. 
In in flight Each bee forms their own, oval "private field", that our own "shield" very similar is, Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for Technology PR and investigation evolution, during the exhibition said. 
The eye of the Bee put together that can see into any direction and in a corner from more than 300 degrees plays in this case an important role. 
In order to imitate the function of the eye put together the researchers picked up the idea of the optical maser - controlled telemeter. 
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a field of sight of 180 degrees within two metres, calculates their long distances and sends signals onto the microprocessor at board that immediately initiates the collision - avoiding process. 
The barrier is registered in fractions of a second, and the robot car changes immediately the course, similar to the movement of the bees, when he turns the tyres around the relevant corner. 
Unlike previous systems this ploy occurs in that instinctively. 
"If it was not like this, can the robot car not fast enough" Toshiyuki Andoh, conductor of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the selfrobot project, declared "to react in order to evade the obstacles". 
The system must react instinctively and immediately since this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the protecting US from recession - a shift, to currently still be regarded as unavoidable within the accidents. 
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees if they avoid other bees. 
And that must end in a split second. 
However, the evasiveness can not occur, unlike the bees, up, down, or at all diagonally - it can be only two - dimensional, and indeed only in the direction the Wendbarkeit of tyres. 
To stand during the bees here infinitely many possibilities openly in order to avoid other bees could help the researchers at the robot car of only the rotary motion, and/or the speeding up and slowing-down's. 
The BR23C contains polymer lithium batteries which are lighter and more vigor - efficient, and therefore have a longer life, as traditional lithium ion batteries. 
Andoh declared it depends on that the instinctive intelligent response and little onto the processing of the data, and still less onto the ability to store these. 
This device must process only a few inputs per second and react to them correspondingly. 
It does not have to store these, or must produce by means of previous manoeuvres so that it uses constantly only a handful KB Memory. 
It gigabyte and megabyte - heavy Memories does not need any. 
This is the first step in the evolution of the immediate conflict prevention technology which will be serial according to appraisal of Nissan within the next ten years in production. 
A further application could find the technology during the GPS satellite navigation, when it directs the motorist conscious around barriers around and leads it so onto the target.
