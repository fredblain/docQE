` I receives the Masters behind the, in order to observe its character ', Günter Brauer, photographer. 
No paragraphs, no ruche, no costumes for the appearance. 
To get the nature of the tall flamenco dancers who renounce the concentration and dedicate themselves to the interpretation around a loose appearance as a woman or as a man. 
On the one hand artists 
On the other hand personality 
I pop in private lives, into these moments that are strange for the public, I know when I can find typical gesture, the depth of a stolen look or expressing - thickness of the hands that are worried because they will not step on the entrance for the personality. 
In his project 'Flamenco-people' represent the German photographer Günter Bauer change - rich Theatralik of some stagings on the stage with singer, dancer and guitarist dar. From this side it was still little known to the artists. 
With this proposal the photographer creates a special Ikonografie of the flamenco representation on different levels. 
The exhibition that appertains to the program of the month of the photograph of the flamenco ', reflect the international importance of flamenco that becomes increasingly greater from the day to day against', the artists declares and illustrates, that 'Flamenco-people' every arbitrary human being can be, however if one has a look at the photographs, the observer will notice notices so that it is not no typical images of artists on the stage. 
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are in the situation to provide happiness on the stage passion, sadness, and to touch the public in this way. 
In order to be able to observe the personality of the artists, one does not have to make no photographs on the stage. 
Your personality and their character is in their hearts. 
What me was interested, to create 'a personal atmosphere that would make to observe the characters of the tallest flamenco masters with the camera for me possible'. 
Farmer, inspires from by the festival ` Cante de read Minas' it turned itself in the year 1997 onto a long journey, around singer, Gitaristen or dancer with a digital cameras to photograph. 
Thanks to the picture sorting work of the camera and the existing material, pictures that remind of classical photograph arose. 
The application of different stylistic resources destroys the classical basis of the picture by which the modernity and the idea how the Bauer understands flamenco are given the image: 'music with traditional roots, which changes and every day ueberrascht'. 
Those ones are not only of the dance, the song or the bridging game at themselves, but the personality of the artist, his character who encourages the public with its art. 
The search for the essential one, after one certain Something, which one in the form of the hearing, the existence's visible becomes, is and the fixed destination of this work that is presented to the El Fotómata in the next time in the gallery was. 
Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, confessed to personalities El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and other appertain to the close selection of almost 70 artists in flamenco among them, the were photographed. 
The project became an anthology of the flamenco and will appear soon as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition. 
Bauer ’ s passion for the portraits provided with it, to pick up this idea two years ago once again and when 'Portrait of the veterans of the sport' to realize ('SportARTproject'). 
although the concepts of the project ` Flamenco-people 'different are, so the photographer adds ` it likes to me very, it is to photograph the people, to become acquainted with it and to move me into their life state, for a brief moment or a longer time. 
I think that in the area of the photograph the portrait is the most difficult genus. 
You meet or meet people, personalities that you do not know sometimes at all, or they let to you for a few minutes alone in order to be able to make a photograph. 
Foreseen from these circumstances, as a photographer I attempt always my ideas to realize. ' 
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco of today with the title ` Flamenco-people 'is in the gallery of the El Fotómata switched off, that in the street with the name la calle de la Mata is and runs parallel to the streets la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition up to the 16th October.
