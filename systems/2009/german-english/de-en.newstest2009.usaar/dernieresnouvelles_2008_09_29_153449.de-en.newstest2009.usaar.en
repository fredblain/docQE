Illhäusern. final 
To a long haul is to Illhäusern on the pitch at last again on course for success. 
Without much effort erspielten the yellow blacks numerous delude opportunities and managed to move one of them, and to gain so the game. 
To show the speed of this meeting in the case of which the attacker had bothered their skills was not very high. 
After a first attack of the public captain Kauffmann whose distance shot passed on the corner the game should dominate Illhäusern with ease, and first Fonderflick with a distance shot, then brain with a high-pass filter, and Romain with a shot with the foot top, succeeded by turns in provoking the defence of Denmark. 
The opponents team blocked in the area medium and let through only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm. 
The start of the second half should be decisive with at first two delude opportunities erkämpften by Riahi and temporal, and to accept now after that with the first gate for the Illhäuser through Marais that stood exactly correctly around a ball that had been repelled by Diebold in a first attempt again. 
Nevertheless the illhäusische scorer should long not be able to enjoy his luck and to be sent onto the bank through which his team-mates had to play numerical inferiorly about 12 minutes later. 
Denmark, however, did not know this use and did not counter an illhäusischen Eleven with any great problems that only a little withdrew, around their defence to 'blocking', except for in the very last seconds of the game in which the ball passed according to a big mess very near at the standard.
