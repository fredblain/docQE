` I a young mother wants to be; around the candidate I do not make myself any worries' 
Your great appearance with your sister, did not hinder her at developing their own personality. 
Mónica Cruz is high spirits daintily, but fully. 
at the time of the siblings of Gruz take their new activity in the fashion very serious. 
For Mónica that means more considerably, than for some pretty and rich girl's, that preserve their reputation. 
She was mango in Paris during the promotion of the company, lays out there their residence and in addition the presentation of the most important bonuses does in the fashion that the Spanish fashion house sponsors. 
Merciful and shy winner on the short routes. 
Tell to us what you do in Paris. 
I came in order to present the new collection for this fall / winter season that my sister Penélope and I projected for mango in addition I have the presentation of the second edition of ` mango Fashion Awards' visits and split up taken from honour at the dinner to Valentinos. 
A very intense working time which is simultaneously exciting. 
You work for the Spanish house, what the basis of your new collection is for the fourth season for mango? 
My sister, both also I am fascinated from the movie theater of the 1950s and 60-er years; there we find many ideas. 
With pleasure I go through a city and observe women as they are dressed as they combine your clothes, I often do that. 
Dancer, actress and Modedesignerin, you are a very versatile woman not true? 
I believe, however finally, everything meets in one and these areas have many similarities. 
Since I was small to that, I was enthusiastic from the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother in order to root in the clothing appropriateness of my finance around and to see their clothes. 
That was super, almost better than to go into a Parks built. 
Already later, than dancer, I attempted always to pay attention to the clothing. 
You know we dancers like it so very much to have our own style in teaching and at the samples, to look mirror and to feel good in this case around in the. 
As an actress, if one gets the suit, one moves oneself into the real actor role. 
Finally, everything is combined with each other, it is like this, a lot of respect before the lindh designer and their Professionalität. 
Recently you became 30, you did not sink into a crisis? 
Oh what. 
I feel better than ever, than thirty year I feel me good. 
I find, the woman becomes mature, she has experience and she keeps up the life fewer mistakes enjoy. 
I am not afraid because of my biological clock no. 
I did the things, that I already since I was small to that, wanted to do and that gave me much internal pleasure. 
Therefore, you think of becoming mother or not? 
Since a long time I already know that I become mother because my body requires that and in addition I want to be a young mother; I want to make that not escape me. 
What concerns the candidate, there I do not set off myself not concerned. 
I negotiate my child great happiness, and to raise it with a lot of love. 
What concerns the film industry, so you keep in the eyes the works in which you participated and that were turned last year. 
Just the same that is and I would like very much, that they are presented to the public. 
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre am very impatient and restless and want to have all which can not be natural immediately at the same time. 
I want very much, that 'La última hora' and are performed 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' to for the first time. 
Seeing once how you like them 
A few days ago you appeared on the Laufstieg with Naomi Campbell, that is right? 
Is really good, do not say something like that. 
It is not like this that I went onto the Laufstieg in order to mould. 
Naomi Campbell, who I know for some time, simply called me and invited me to London, around at a parade for the charity event of theirs organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothing that we show participate. I know that two garments were put up to auction from our collection for Mango in order to collect the money for Naomis NGO. 
The people do not know Naomis good heart. 
Many things about them are told. I, as that one who knows it would say to you that they do not vote. 
In spite of that I will support this good thing at which it is shared. 
She asked me for participating in the parade for this magnanimous thing, however if it comes and me asks for doing a handstand, I will do also that. 
in order to support the women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
