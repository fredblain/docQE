Debate about bilingual education: education in English-speaking world, surroundings 
In this edition of the "Education Watch" discuss Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi the positions of the candidates for the bilingual training. 
Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific employee in Kalifonischen studies and a senior director in specific area of expertise education sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, a co-author is of the book "not as good as one thinks: Why the middle class a school selection need". 
To speak to the hispanischen voters is a complicated task. 
Bar rack Obama propositions on the issue education are a typical example of that. 
Obama campaign mentions, that "to finish the probability with afro - American and hispanischen pupils successfully the school, lower is, than with white pupils - what tunes". 
In order to close this service distance, Obama education action plan recommends a bilingual in particular among other ones in the training for those ones who learn English first. 
Nevertheless the question exists at Obama darin whether his use contradicting his interest for the bilingual training that puts which focuses on onto instruction in other languages than English reducing the distance in the sportsmen. 
let's take "Sixth Street Prep" a primary school, as an example in eastern Los Angeles. 
Is The majority of pupils hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. 
More than one third parties of the pupils from whom many are not before recently in the country learn English. 
Nevertheless 100 percent of pupils of the fourth class passed the public examination into 2008 amazing ones in Mathe on a good level. 
Also surprisingly 93 per cent of children were valued as good from the fourth school year in the English examination. 
This astonishing success was achieved with other methods, as those ones that are preferred by Obama. 
The school Sixth Street puts its focus, onto permanent control of the knowledge and an attitude which does not tolerate no exceptions, on inspection and practice. 
Furthermore the school practises the approach to which the training proceeds in a English-speaking surroundings. Exactly that the point which Obama is supposed to pay attention to, according to the headmistress Linda Mikels is. 
This approach puts importance onto the almost exclusive use of the English language in the compartment instruction. 
Woman of Mikels, who refuses the idea of bilingual training, said to me the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil who only shortly before had come from Mexico. 12 months later one would enter the schoolroom before and would not recognize could it anymore. 
"It functions", she said, "it functions for us". 
Obama would become a school how this "Sixth Street Prep" as model for other schools with great proportion at Latin American and other English learning pupils take? 
The performance of the school would make the answer to this question easy, however, the formation - political positions within his of own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen already long support the idea of bilingual training) and his own unstinting support for the bilingual training do answer to predictions uncertainly above Obama. 
While he is agreeing to the point, that immigrants should learn English, it trivialisiert the issue recently in his saying that people should stop to make oneself for worries about the legislation aiming at "only English". 
Instead of this, he said: "her are supposed to guarantee, that their child Spanish can". 
If Obama wants to close the service distance in fact, he is supposed to consider carefully education systems that function instead of despising it and trivialisieren.
