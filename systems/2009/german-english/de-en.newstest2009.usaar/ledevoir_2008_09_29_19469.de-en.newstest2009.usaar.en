Meeting - Of from the blood, that again secure became 
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary their creation yesterday, and their president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all reason to be pleased, because Hema-Quebec became one of the most secure and most efficient blood banks of the world. 
And particularly she retrieved the confidence of the public which had been shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980th and 1990th years heavily. 
As one knows, the national blood reserves managed from the blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated during the 1980th years with the HIV and hepatitis C virus. 
Faced with this tragedy and the discontent public the government of Canada initiated in February 1994 an investigation public, seen through the judge Horace Krever that to the goal it had to bring light into the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and to prevent to elaborate directives, around a renewed disaster of this type of. 
while judge Krever was still hesitating with giving his report several provinces set then a committee onto the legs that aim was to develop a new system to the administration of blood in Canada it. 
In Quebec the committee Gélineau fulfilled this task. 
According to the reports by Gélineau and Krever two blood banks were set up in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, in order to supply the other provinces and the two territories. 
` 1998 when Hema-Quebec started their work hardly any 38% of people had confidence into the blood preserve system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers. 
The situation was discouraging. 
Through the enormous efforts around the safety of the blood to improve and through the work on this field during the following years, we have the confidence of the recover ', they says, before it stresses proudly, that at the beginning of 2008 in the meantime almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec. 
Dr. Décary keeps, however, in the consciousness, that ` confidence something extremely brittle is'. 
Since their foundation on 28th September 1998 Hema-Quebec acts according to the principle of caution. 
At this time we lived through the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman that holds the leadership since the creation in 1998 tells. 
'and we had not the slightest idea, whether the disease could be transferred via the blood. 
Therefore we referred to one of the key directives of the reports by Krever and Gélineau, according to which one uses exclusion measures if one does not know this that leads to death unavoidably and if an illness that is expressed through a degeneration of the brain continues only slowly as it is the case obviously during the Creutzfeldt Jakob illness. 
Therefore one did not accept in April 1999 any blood of persons who had detained themselves longer since 1980 than a month in the United Kingdom. 
Now, few years ago it was proved without any doubt that this disease will transfer via the blood. 
So this event showed us that the principle of the caution that we used absolutely has a purpose. 
In 1999 a much more precise technique for the recognition of HIV appeared on the market: To prove the Nukleinsäure tests (NST) that facilitate it directly in the blood of the donor the occurrence of the virus itself, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as it was the case at the up to now used tests. 
The NST made it possible to reduce the incubation period that between the time when, to which the person was infected and that, if the first viruses can be proved by our techniques in the blood, occurs, the specialist declares. 
This time could be reduced to a period by little as a week. 
The risk became like this that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, considerably reduced. 
These improvements facilitated it, the risk, to assign AIDS about a blood transfusion to lower in considerable extent. 
Nowadays one of 12 million persons runs danger, with HIV infected blood keep. 
` in other words that is called, that one would have to distribute 12 million blood conserves before somebody was infected with HIV. 
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400 and 500 blood every year, it would last more than 24 years before a case occurs with the HIV about a blood conserve transferred. 
I believe, that one can feel well in this case nowadays if one gets a blood transfusion or prescribes a blood transfusion around the health reconstruct ', the direction head of Hema-Quebec means. 
` our challenge for the next ten years it is, the safety of our products to receive. 
One never knows how germs can reach into the system. 
Only in last year the Chikungunya virus emerged on the island Reunion, which will transfer, just the same as the west Nile virus, through insects on the blood. 
We must 'control' constant ', Dr. Décary goes on before it stresses that Hema-Quebec must in addition provide a secure supply next to sufficient supply. 
` this demand climbs, because the population ages. 
Since the treatments for cancer is more aggressive, the patients need often new red blood cells or blood platelets. 
The of the population affects also the blood donor net, to which on average only 3% the to the blood donations appertain appropriate inhabitants of Quebec. 
In this case can every healthy person, 18 years or older is and the eligibility criteria fulfills, to donate every 56 days to blood six times in the year. 
On average 14% of the persons that provide their blood, do not accept, because for example fell with AIDS or malaria ill, and who traveled to a country are spread in which malaria is, becomes for a year of the blood donations impossible. 
` with these 3% we create it, to receive an inventory that satisfies the needs of the hospitals. 
Lack of stockpiles is very rare. 
But one must renew the members of this donor network if they can become older and not donate no blood more. 
It is heavy to hold it and to bring it to becoming regular donors to convince the people of donating blood particularly, however. 
The life is nowadays so hectic that one finds the time rarely an hour at the to transfer blood donations', Francine Décary feels sorry. 
With an annual budget of 297 million $Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood, but also human tissues, under that Knochentransplantate, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively in the case of hard fire injuries. 
These tissues are examined, worked and frozen before they become at Hema-Quebec zwischengelagert that manages also the single public umbilical cord blood bank of Quebec. 
There is rich blood at stem cells in the umbilical cord that formerly was considered as biomedical waste, which can be used for that, difficult illnesses, as for example leukemia, to handle. 
` before some weeks we the occlusion of our one thousandth umbilical cord blood test, and we celebrated to intend to lose annually more than a thousand. 
'we should begin presumably at the beginning of next year so that, it for transplantation available put', Dr. Décary keeps on declaring, that this programme the umbilical cord blood - abnahme than very liked describes. 
'a lot of mothers are convinced by that, no access to that to credit', denn Hema-Quebec lack the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals of Quebec.
