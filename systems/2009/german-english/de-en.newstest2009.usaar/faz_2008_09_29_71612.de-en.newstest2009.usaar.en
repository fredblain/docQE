Düsseldorfer hopes rest on Frankfurt 
Great words are not missing in the letter of the WestLB executive board onto the staff of the house. 
"The central capital market house of the savings bank Finanzgruppe" can arise through a combining of units of the Düsseldorfer bank with the Frankfurter, it is said in the writing become known on Monday. 
The first would bring one "Competence block" with sustainable little in a such business one. 
And anyway a such link can be the decisive impulse to further grouping in the state bank sector. 
So it reads itself if an executive board wants to demonstrate in a difficult time act. 
Because the hit WestLB stands still under tremendous pressure. 
To find a future solution not only on the part of the European Commission, but also through the Federal Institution for financial service supervision who explained only recently the nordrhein-westfälischen central government the time is urgent. 
Of one as always gearteten combination between the deca-bank, the savings bank customers because of their investment funds know, and the first is, however the speech already for some time - also on Frankfurt side. 
Indeed deca-bank chief Franz Waas made be known with the presentation of the semidates at the end of August, in a merger of the house at the cerium main highway with a state bank, about the Helaba or the WestLB, he does not see does not make sense. 
Nevertheless the administration council of the Deka which ever half is carried by the state banks and the savings bank associations charged the executive board to lead talks with the first about common business activities. 
In this case it could be a question of the capital market business or parts from that. 
The talks have certainly, so it is called at the financial center, just first begun. 
It is not talked about the deca-bank which numbers among the most important employers with their 3,000 staff at in the city Frankfurt for the first time if it is a question of consolidation in the savings bank sector. 
In 2003 it long looked a moment so, as if Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba can fuse with the state bank the deca-bank. 
Nothing became from this three Federal Government, however. 
Hardly the plans had not become public, the Hessische Central Government spoke out against a participation of the Helaba at that. 
The two other houses did not find then to each other. 
The Rheinland-Pfalz state bank went instead of this onto the Baden-Württemberg state bank in Stuttgart. 
Nevertheless there were again and again thought games about a combination of the deca-bank with state banks. 
Last Günther Merl, executive board chairperson of the Helaba, had spoken out, however, against map exercises about a meeting with his house. 
Independently of that it seems to mature the recognition, however, that a Zusammenrücken of the various houses of the public sector does needed. 
After the regional elections is now in Bavaria past, when first a combination of the BayernLB with the Baden-Württemberg state bank could come closer. 
For the Helaba that is absolutely not a good information. 
if the pressure to further mergers should increase the partners go out after and after it for that. 
In the south she would be only junior partner, although they has stood the financial crisis up to now by far better as the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A meeting with the west LB in turn the savings bank and endorsement association Hessen-Thüringen that is participated in the Helaba with 85 percent at the beginning of the year shot a barrier. 
The north LB would stay if need be. 
Such geostrategic are, however only one side. 
On the other one it is the question of the question as the different business models of the individual houses match. 
In June Merl expressed, the decisive question with the business model the future ability of the state banks is supposed to be guaranteed was not answered by the German savings bank and Endorsement Association up to now. 
At the end the west LB could stand also a dismantling that, however, is not wanted there of course. 
So it is talked then also in the letter of the nonlocal executive board of that, it becomes in any case one "all-in solution" for the house targeted. 
How that with the meeting of individual units with the can be brought under a hat will still be proved.
