The psychology of the outdoing - or why we are ready to pay more 
In the case of auctions the customers tend to issuing more and überbewerten the Feilgebotene thus. 
Neurologists and economic researchers of the university of New York succeeded now in discovering the neurologic - economic basics of this familiar and seemingly irrational behaviour. 
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine the people do not want to give themselves beatenly in a competition, as such an auction on, and are therefore ready to pay even excessive prices. 
The researchers attempted to find out the neurologic scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions. 
A group of volunteers should play National while the other one was participating in on action - in both cases the acting brain regions of the probands were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). 
With two play the participants could extract money, however, an increased activity of the Striatum, a complex below the brain rind, with losers of the auction in the case of which the outdoing of the rival plays an important role was measured. 
Next to many other functions this brain region is for this "selfreward" of the nervous system responsible. 
The researchers thought therefore the price could be explained through the avoidance of a Überreaktion of the Striatums. 
In order to support their thesis, the economists did investigations to follow the money in the research group besides. 
In This Case three groups should offer against a partner under different conditions. 
The inspection was informed of the true value of the product, after that they did their operations. 
15 dollar reward were in addition promised to another group, for the case, that they emerge as winners out of the game. 
The third group received 15 dollars in front of the auction which were also lost in the case of a lost game. 
The difference between two groups consisted therefore only in that, that the accentuation at one on the winning lay, during at the other one on the losing. 
Expressed by neurologists as an evidence for those ones hypothesis however the members of the group playing "against the losing" to higher operations were ready, as those in the Control - and/or. the "profit" group. 
"These results can not be derived from any previous economic theory. 
These justified indeed up to now the behavior observed in the case of auctions only with the joy about the winning, and/or risk avoidance. 
The contradiction between these two theories was solved thanks to the picture - giving neurologic procedures, so that we now have a third statement ready credit "- Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic unit of the University of New York, meant.
