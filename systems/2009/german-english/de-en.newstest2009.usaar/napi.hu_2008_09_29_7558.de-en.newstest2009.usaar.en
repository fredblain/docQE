A name for the sündteure child 
Now there is the written version of the 700 - Mrd - dollar of difficult rescue package law which will be to be used in several stages and is aimed at the purchase of bad loans from the banks. 
In the first round half the money is supposed to be distributed. 
In a session, that on Saturday after midnight local time east coast zu Ende ging, struggled themselves the congress representatives after more - daily debates for an agreement about that 700 - billion dollar heavy rescue parcel, reported Reuters. 
"we significant progress have achieve", Nancy Pelosi, democratic president said in the American Chamber of Deputies, and meant one must only still bring the agreement to paper. 
both presidential candidates supported the achieved compromise about the rescue package - Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson thought to the result: the programme will show effect and it becomes efficient, one must do, however, still more. According to Pelosi of Wall Street would not go it here around the rescue, but around pulling the helm of the economy. 
The written composure of the package still became before the of the Asian markets, therefore, Washington time on on sunday night 8 at (Central European time Monday 2 a.m. in the morning), publishes, did not activate, however, any flight of fancy on the stock markets. 
On Monday the House of Representatives votes first on the draft for the stabilization of the economy of 2008, then the senate is at the series. 
President George W. Bush spoke at the saturday night with Pelosi, and also the White House welcomed the news on the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress achieved in the night and value the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and to protect our economy, Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House, said. 
the programme differs, however, from the initial recommendation of the Bush administration according to which the 700 billion dollars should be spent at the same time for the purchase of bonds rotten, burdened with loans. 
In a first tranche maximally half of the 700 - billion - amount with which 250 billion are immediately available is supposed to be distributed after as expected the congress will vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is supposed to be spent for the purchase of credit - loaded, bad bonds, and the president is supposed to decide on the further 100 billion USD. 
The programme is checked by an own commission to which also the president of the Federal Reserve belongs. 
The other half of the 700 depends on a further decision of the Congress. 
In the sense of the law the Treasury can use also a combined tactics: Can buy same time bad loans, mortgages, and bonds burdened with mortgages, or also other "poisonous" credits. 
Told as competent persons of the ministry the purchase can both in an auction, than also directly occur. 
The law makes to participate in an insurance programme with which the Treasury guarantees the worrying resources, and the companies pay the Exchequer charges corresponding to the damages to be expected for the affected companies possible. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so, that up to 700 billion dollars can be provided as emergency aid for the American financial system is for the large-scale purchase of bad means, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk which is activated by the collapse of a bigger bank. 
We set Paulson the necessary steps so that we are ready for the introduction of the law as soon as it was signed. 
The chiefs of the banks in trouble guessed and now dependent onto government aid can reckon, however, that their dispatches which are mentioned "Golden Handshake" in the overseas - slang salopp are shortened by the government. 
There will be A cut of salaries only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury helps out in each case. 
The reduction in means basically, that if the department buys within the framework of an auction, so this "Golden Handshake" besteuert becomes, unless, that serve bank leader is removed into the pension. 
In the case of a direct purchasing the bad loans the government will join in aggressively in order to guarantee that the directors ’ pay are not exaggerated. 
To the picture appertains also, that the existing Golden Handshake-Verträge are changed not - the restrictions refer only to new agreements, in this way all the more people participate in the programme. 
That is the first case in American history, the democrat Barney Frank, chairperson of the Financial Committee the measure, commented on cuts being controlled with manager - salaries by law. 
The state gains participation rights at the participating banks so that the risk sinks for the taxpayers since they can also be involved as soon as it the economy and in this way also the saved bank again better goes. 
The draft law plans that the president must make a proposition how the taxpayers' are supposed to get back their lost money from the financial sector again to the congress in the next five years. 
There were, however, sceptics who expressed their doubts with respect to the plan on both sides. 
That is not what the American people expect of us, the plan does not protect the money of the taxpayers under any circumstances, according to the Californian republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur meant: The measures were driven forward by the same people, that also for the collapse of the Wall Street are responsible.
