The superadhesive which makes go up at walls 
To be able to climb up the strengths of the force of gravity thanks to an adhesive to conquer and walls as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centers from which one thing now apparently almost arrived at the goal. 
With an adhesive on an area qcm found only by 2,5 the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kilos bodies on a normal wall. 
The STUDIO - a US magazine has, the researcher of the university of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory published the results. 
The material invented by the team of researchers is a development of the already used adhesives, which a special carbon structure, mentioned Kohlenstoff-Nanoröhrchen, use. 
"this principle of the adhesive can one as a line to a pile of spaghetti of ordered thermionic valves imagine", declaredly Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists made feet of the geckos be inspired of the, which ones of microscopic Härchen that give a perfect stop to the animal are overcast. 
The with different materials such as glass teflon and sandpaper of test carried out showed that the new adhesive is zehnmal stronger than the consider ability of the feet of reptiles and "remove from the wall" at the same time "without problems makes", according to Liming Dai, researcher of the department of engineering of the at University of Dayton. 
WANDERING AT WALLS? "These material could" be used "as deciduous sniffing", Liming Dai in addition puts. 
About around as to go Spiderman at walls? Maybe already, but the researchers rather think of one less fascinating benefit, as about the link electrical equipment, because conductors of heat and electricity are the nano small tubes in the same way. 
Other fields could fall into the area of space. 
For the moment the superheroes must wait therefore still. 
The other type of research - also the university of Berkeley, California, dedicates itself to a new adhesive kind. 
In an article in the American Chemical Syndrome Society the Californian scientists present an adhesive of microfibres the as hairs through movement on a surface even the dust clean and through that always a perfect liability preserve.
