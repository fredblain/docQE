The Sudeten required a referendum of the United States 
The Sudetendeutschen ones had requested in 1945 the affiliation of the Böhmerwaldes onto the United States. 
This follows from a letter which rests in the collections of the South - Bohemian scientific library. 
If we can not be component of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least so under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With a such desire some groups are supposed to have turned in 1945 to the US president from Sudetendeutschen ones. 
This follows among other things from a letter which was maintained in a private archives and which today is kept in the collections of the South - Bohemian scientific library. 
The Germans of Krumau ask the American president in the letter, it is not supposed to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - that was charmed by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - onto Czechoslovakia. 
"we the situation have understood correct and want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies German territory in fact, but when liberator", it is called in a letter, that with the Worten "Menschen, that the fate of the Sudeten hug at the liegt" sign is. 
Since the end of the Czechoslovakia makes the Sudetendeutschen ones presume - in knowledge of the Czech national character -, the author of the letter ask the American president for their expecting brutality, thoughtlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, to take over the Bohemian Forest for today and for ever the protection domination. 
"we can believe not that you award this area to a state other for us without regard for the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants the minorities suppresses and to remove attempted and not contributed in that at all anything for to the victory of the allies has", is to read in the letter. 
The reason for why the author can not sign is supposedly the fear of revenge desires of the "Czech suppressors". 
If the of the president entertains doubts about the mind of the Böhmerwalddeutschen, it is sufficient if it initiated a referendum in the Böhmerwaldgau over whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or to live under the protection rule of the United States. 
Although the text of the letter likes to ring in today's knowledge of the post-war a little naively, it draws, however a good picture in opinion of some time witnesses with regard to the former expectations of the Sudetendeutschen ones. 
even if at least the bohemian German had to foresee that one would negotiate about their deportation from the republic, only few of them admitted such a possibility to themselves anyway. 
Some waited, that the United States and Great Britain for the Sudeten would negotiate a kind of autonomy. 
Again other believed, they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia. 
Also the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa who comes from Budweis confirms that one. 
It was used as a Budweiser German near the Navy in the Baltic Sea in the war. 
When it came into British captivity at the end of the war and one brought it into a a prisoner of war camp after getting - stone, dozens of further Bohemian Germans came to it, he is supposed to teach them Czech. 
"You believed" if they came back the Czech thing "would" come "to them too" fit ", according to Chalupa. 
Nobody of the German prisoners of war who had lived before the war in the Czechoslovakia reckoned in his view one marketing it from the republic on the basis of the.
