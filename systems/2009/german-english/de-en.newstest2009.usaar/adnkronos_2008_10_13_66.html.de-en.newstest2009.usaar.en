MP3 players under indictment: Danger of hearing - damages 
Hearing loud music over a longer space of time with acceptable music devices, as such MP3 players, can lead to permanent impaired hearings. 
The European commission which quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee about the current one and recently identified health risks) of the EU in a report today spread into Brussels announces this. 
"from the report - so it is called in a comment - realizes, that 5-10% of those ones that weekly for at least five years longer hear than an hour on day of loud music with acceptable recording equipment the lasting loss of their hearing riskieren". 
"I do worries myself that a so great number of young people who put usually acceptable recording equipment and mobile phones on a high volume damage their voice heard without knowing it unwiederbringlich", according to Meglena Kuneva. 
"from the scientific discoveries - so it is called on the part of the EU - a clear risk that is urgent to fast action is proved. 
It is what in fact counts to sensitize the consumer and to turn this information into common good. 
We must check faced with this scientific evidence the already existing control systems again so that they are completely effective and "hold pace with the new technology". 
Brussels had charged the independent scientific committee faced with the spread use of the acceptable recording equipment among young people. 
"this scientist - so the communication from the EU closes - confirm that one is too quite worried and that the Eu Kommission will examine the necessary measures now together with the other Eu members and the affected around children and young people better before the noise, that from acceptable recording equipment and similar devices comes, to protect to ability". 
already a European standard exists at the moment, that the level of the noise of acceptable recording equipment restricts on 100 decibels. The concern about the damages which could come from a large excessive noise. 
One can delimit They damage very much, in which one grasps solutions as the reduction of reducing noise and the length of the noise suspension. 
In its report, the scientific committee of the EU refers, that, when the users of acceptable recording equipment only music says five hours a week (louder than 89 decibels) to hear so that the legal limits are already crossed that concerning the maximum noise levels in the job are valid. 
Those ones, to exceed the music this border risk, the complete loss of the hearing within five years. 
That would concern therefore 5-10% of the users of such devices whose number can be estimated at between 2,5 and 10 million persons in the Eu.
