On reunions to the old movie theater Paradiso - the towns lock their historic cinemas 
The historical movie theaters close due to the favored multichannel movie theaters. 
"one city without cinemas is a blind city, as a face without eyes. 
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore currently describes something with effect in the large urban centres Italy, and also in the provinces, happens. 
The process of the exclusion of the movie theaters which began with the birth of the big multihall complexes in the periphery means in the long term the death for the one eel cinema in the center. A process which does not appear only unabwendbar and irrevocably, but supports also the trains of a cultural crime. 
Mostly historical places of full memories are affected ", to lose as a friend" it is, with which one a piece streets of full of emotion put back plan ", so the director of the film" Nuovo Cinema Paradiso ", which brought in the Oscar and the big prize from Cannes for him 20 years ago. It is a question of the history of a Vorstadtkinos and his nostalgia which consists of living in a presumably forever lost movie theater world. 
The figures, which the particular, the central trade association delivers, speak one clearly language: in the past five years the enormous amount of 316 of traditional movie theater had to close; the cinemas paid this bill to for the most part of in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 into Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
To the most strongly affected areas belong Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost movie theaters, followed from the Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This shows the main culprits being the multichannel movie theaters, because it is just these three areas in which the greatest number of these modern movie theaters was registered: with 195 in the last five years the Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are it both in Tuscany and in the Emilia-Romagna. 
"this business has in an irrational manner develop", so Paolo Protti, the president of the particular ", it is useful indeed, that new structures turn out, nevertheless at first place the receipt of the already existing one stands, because a hall closes in the city, all his regular customers are not ready to consult a multichannel cinema instead of the old one in the periphery. 
And here still the lack of budget remains for the ground of the trade association of Ã¤usser care: the burden of debt noted by the state is approx. 10 million euros. 
It is a disgrace from an ethical position that the government does not pay attention to the existing laws. 
In order to receive the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be per in the year of needs ". 
The case of Bologne, the first Italian city to decide due to of about the old cinemas on protecting these through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec, is interesting; it is a question of that to protect first descendants of this kind in Italy, which aims at that, the traditional movie theaters and to support, and this both in the historic centre, than also in the periphery. 
Under the foreseen measures also tax Bevorteilungen are for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the audience concerning the local traffic's: it will be allowed to go into the traffic - limited fields of the centre and in addition to park to more favorable parking fees. 
"it a pleasant Initiative is", so Giuseppe Tornatore ", I hopes, that other cities will follow our example and in addition also still project new concepts. 
Certainly, however, we need also a better audio and video equipment in order to be able to achieve something against the superpower of the multichannel halls, because finally the public is from today more pretentious. 
The defense of the traditional movie theater was always an important issue for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that brought me for this purpose this "Nuovo cinema Paradiso" to found, even if I had played with the idea already since 10 years ago. 
Since 25 years I live in Rome; when I pass by at the Rialto or at the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I experienced so many different emotions, I turn myself to on the side in order not to have to see the dust - overcast posters.
