If the energy originates from the waves, the large ones accumulate suddenly 
It is a not versiegende money source, which one above 70% of the surface of the planet covers and the big energy companies of the world do not seem this before now understand. 
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable sources of energy onto those ones now all look, and also to occupy seek, such giants as Chevron. 
The possibility to gain vigor from the movements of the sea is already since 70 years taken into account and examined; not by chance these studies were intensified since the first oil crisis considerably. 
When the price of to in 1980 started around 1980 vergas one the idea of the energy from the sea now, however, environmental organisations and the climbed the price of oil would insist on new impulses in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London reckons that 15% of the Worldwide energy demand of the vigor produced through the ocean waves could be covered. 
This would amount to the double one of the vigor currently produced through nuclear power stations. 
In addition the currents and tidal would in addition still come. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first company to put on the energy from the sea now is Enersis who signed a contract for the establishment of a power plant in 2005 in northern Portugal. 
When This news was published it seemed to act around a revolutionary step. 
It is two years later now more and more to firms from the traditional energy policy that put on the marine energy production. 
"Chevron examines these technologies" - so the speaker of an enterprise, known to the American Giants, in the Wall Street Journal - and the possibility to cooperate with us considers. " 
It is a question at that of to obtain a listing from the American energy commission which is necessary in order to start a project before the coast Alaskas. 
This is a sign not to be underestimated, before a. if one considers that just in Alaska oil keeps on being won through the United States and president Bush got first the plans going recently for new borings. 
Next to chevron also the companies are Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey that invest in the new industry; nevertheless, if the details are not known, observers speak so of an increasing interest. 
Still improvement - worthy technologies. 
Experts speak of a technology being still in the departure, this last but not least, since the last doubts are not yet clarified on the part of the environmentalists. 
Up to now projects such as the one are in Portugal and also Scotland rather small dimension and no ecological problems to be taken seriously to cause shine. 
In order to produce vigor, however, in a large scale, it needs technologies with far greater influence on the environment. 
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power about is useful a system of buoys joined with each other. 
The shear of the waves that moves the buoys up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmers about plungers and magically. 
This drives a turbine which practices in turn a generator. 
The electricity is sent on that about run-off water management to the coast. 
Until now there is four planned plant this kind that only still waits for the state approval. A part of the gained vigor could serve also for military facilities. 
Meanwhile Verdant Power produces already energy for a product department store and a flap park with the aid of submarine turbines in the East River from New York. 
The movements of water drives during the tidal the turbines that feeds the generator through the arising rotary motion. 
According to Verdant been a long queue of potential clients waits for the necessary authorizations around these energy sources are useful. 
Only the waves then the tides. 
The Potenzial who is in the tides earns a special interest at the moment according to the institute for power generation investigation. 
Nevertheless, although it is a question also of an irregular phenomenon the tidal are better predictable as wind currents, the sun and the waves, and therefore a trustworthier power source. 
Just the tidal power it is, which Federal state as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states brought to investing dollars in the year 2008 in the year 2008 - for 2009 are already up to 35 million planned.
