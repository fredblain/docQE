Lukaschenko - opposition: 
At the elections on Sunday not a member of the opposition got into the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers think this is due to on prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, the OECD presumes, however, Gesetzwidrigkeiten with the counting of votes. 
The OECD which sent 450 observers from 43 countries did not acknowledge the elections. 
De Legislatur of the 10 - million inhabitant state manages indeed since decades without opposition. Nevertheless has the under the name "Vereinte democratic strengths" (ODS) gathered adverse party in front of the choices of yesterday serious expects, that this time Lukaschenko, who already renewed his presidential term at the unhealthy elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment 2006 for the fourth time, unites members of the opposition in the parliament "approve" dignity. 
Therefore the ODS took distance even of the before planned boycotts. 
Ukraine becomes economically increasingly more dependent thanks to the increasing prices with the gas import of Russia. For the relief of the price increases even loans were taken up, and the country agreed also to the sale of the Beltransgas, the proprietor of the gas pipeline leading through the country, onto the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition the hope the Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other hochrangige politicians because of the political system classified as antidemocratic in the EU have travel ban stood therefore. 
The evaluation report of the elections of the OECD guaranteed for a temporary relaxation, in which the emphasis lay rather on the positive movements, instead of on the shortcomings - as about the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidate of the elections. 
However, the rapid report of the OECD already on Monday criticized the campaign - accordingly might occur opposition ell not in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present with the counting of the vote. 
In spite of all that the opposition is a recovery in the political system recognize: Political prisoners were put for instance on released prisoners, and Minsk is ready even for smaller confrontation with Moscow when the recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces keeps on refusing South Ossetia and Abkhazia it although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on the paper, considers the two areas as independent since a month. 
"we have done two steps forward and one backwards, however the most important thing is, that the dialog between Belarus and the EU begun have", Alexander Milinkevich said with regard to our story. 
In the view of the opposition candidate of the presidential elections of 2006 a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful ones fear have gotten, to let member of the opposition the parliament also only one. 
The opposition does not plan any protest measures faced with the results, but it attempts rather to explain the voters the need for economic reform. 
"We have to fight here with many problems - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us stones during in distribution into the way, but nevertheless I see even the older ones that people support the change more and more -" Milinkewitsch said in allusion to that, that not even the meistunterst√ºtzte shift of the pensioners with the Lukashenko regime einverstanden is, whose only income is the manufacture social security. 
"Thanks to the debt of the country and the rise in the trade it is merely a matter of, to which" to crumble onto "social safety" reminding the silence of a cemetery "begins", according to Milinkewitsch. 
Unlike the opposition politician Russian observers referred to the elections as democratic. 
Sergej Lebedev, ladder of the mission of the Commonwealth Independent States declared ria Novosti to the news agency: "this people believe the action, and not the words". The absence of the opposition is therefore an evidence for the maturity of the Belarus voters.
