` Sangre de mayo ': hero paper of Garci 
Inspires of 'Episodios Nacionales' of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci sets in 'Sangre de mayo' this overworked version of the famous revolt of Spaniards against the French dar. That is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with approximately 15 million euros of investment for the knack works. 
In this way the Cineast attempted ` one lot of personalities and social analysis' Carci declared today to represent 'what he always admired at the factories of the famous new writer during the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of the characters. 
` Sangre de mayo 'with a film length of more than zweieinhalb hours, is shown presented this Friday in cinemas and later at the sender Telemadrid as a four hour long miniseries. 
José Luis Garci, tall fan of the literature of, insures, that to be thanks to this knack work ` Childhood dream 'into compliance with went. He has to owe this to Esperanza Aguirre, who charged him to shoot a commemorating - film for the second century festival into Madrid on 2nd November three years ago of the autonomous community Madrid. Particularly, because the history on the basis of ` Episodios Nacionales' is based, that one accepted the task. 
The total contribution of 15 million that was set by the autonomous Madrid community for knack works offers Garci as it added that ` unique possibility 'with the aid of decorations and corresponding linings the image of the ` confused Spain, which selected the wrong chief for the fight,' because the people through the fight for the independence and under the domination of the Ferdinands of VII in arrears brachten. 
However, the Cineast feels sorry, that one with the funding how at ` Alatriste 'or ` Los fantasmas de Goya (twice so high when at ` Sangre de mayo') 'could not calculate, therefore some scenes could not be shot from the filmscript with Horacio Valcárcel, who almost his entire career cooperated to Garci with. 
For this reason, Garci has, that also film director in 'Volver a empezar' were, participated through his usual working method: he joined in the actors onto the stage, with which one must rehearse first before one starts turning and appeared for those ones that had not done any Casting he 'demuetigend' and 'exists' respect providing ', one part the profession's of the film director in giving aid in the theatre and in the movie theater in order to know what happens in the cinema industry in which one works. 
Many actors, onto which it in 'Sangre de mayo' struck, must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Garci, Oscar - candidate in four nominations (from which he won one), thinks and assured that a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie does not represent to any of the three candidates that represent this year Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood. neither 'Sangre de mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' and finally neither the selected one Film 'Los girasoles ciegos'. 
For this film Garci does not expect any distinctions. 
` at the beginning of you believe, that you work for the possibility of producing descendants, later you notice that it is only for the growth, and now you are in a satisfied way when one produced still have a film 'declared according to Garci more than 30 years career.
