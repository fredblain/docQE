Obscure street in city, often forgotten and possible soon to sell 
From what New York City united thousands of highways, avenues, side streets and other by-pass roads famously, and from what other are only comfortable. 
Nevertheless it is even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing Local heavy to say where there is Extra Place, simple, because most have never heard about that. 
These tiny Street is in the East Village and runs from the first to Street Richtung north between Bowery and to Second Avenue without reaching the Second Street. 
It is 30 feet broad and 120 feet long and rather looks like a dusty alleyway than to a passage route in an acting way used. 
There are not also no road signs. 
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard street plan. 
Nevertheless this street has its admirer. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently constructed luxurious buildings on the first Street. 
copy place wants to pave again in order to take a clean passage to the shops and boutiques which are expected in the new buildings. 
the longstanding neighbourhood belongs to the other admirers, that one simply says it is fascinated from the short alleyway because she is one of the remains of the past of the block. 
Nevertheless the local administrative department which is responsible for protection and establishment of the accommodation and is responsible for the street does not have any interest in receiving it. 
During a session of the committee for land use of the parish council this month representatives projected of the City Council and Avalon Bay a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction. 
Nevertheless the committee prefers, that the road stays in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan that is supposed to be presented in next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the local authorities in the town council 3. 
very little room stayed in owned by the city and we would like, that Extra Place "keeps on" belonging "to the city, she said. 
"It Angebote could give what could be finished by Avalon as one repairs the street and practices the street, however, we also want the public access to keep on being guaranteed." 
Avalon Bay, who the company would like to let out space to, announced some months ago that pave small streets again and seats that are among other things thought for a caf√© arrange. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was turned into the first time in public during the meeting in this month. 
Michele de Milly, a speaker of the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road indeed, it does absolutely not want to have her, however. 
"The preoccupation of the Avalon Bay is it this decayed lane renovate and to turn into a public meeting point", she said and added that the city itself had suggested the sale. 
Seth Donlin, speaker of the department of crop protection thought it was the desire of the city actual to sell the streets and accentuated, rather to develop it the property than to manage the task of the department is. 
Compared with his colored neighborhood The Bowery extra place retained something of its historical impression. 
Some believe that the road agreed with their names in the year 1802, as a big farm which belonged to Philip Minthorne between his numerous children people split up and a close strip land was not demanded by any. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk skirt monument that was closed in 2006 opened itself to the Extra Place and the street is certain most the most confessed by Ramones as a scenery for the photograph on the Cover of the album "Rocket to Russia". 
The location was splendid, Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones which had made the photograph was in November 1976, said. 
The street was full of scrap metal, rogue and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and rope. 
Unite inhabitants, including the Blogger that write about the Gentrifizierung of the East Village, refused the idea of the sale from Extra Place, with the argument, that this public plot, as modest as it is, keeps on being supposed to stay public. 
Other considered Extra Place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be let in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, which the Blog by the name of "Jeremiahs" practices "disappearing New York" (untertitelt with "The book of complaints: A bitter nostalgic look onto the city becoming extinct"), published a part of the conversation of the city history about Extra Place that had appeared in the journal "The New Yorker" in the years in 1952. 
The author Brendan Gill, wrote then: "extra Place is a small narrow dead-end street, which remains even during the day dark and characterized by rusty metal door of warehouses, shut windows and week - old newspapers flying onto rainwater gutters past is". 
With few exceptions the road looked just as recently at an evening. 
A rat walked through the rear part of the street, not far from the door that formerly led to the CBGB, where there is a more expensive clothing business today. 
Graffiti was to be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle did not lie on the ground far from a fresh bundle of newspapers thrown out. 
Nevertheless Some passers-by said they would have thought about special place rare suggested, that the road could be polished up a little. 
Fields, added, that in his opinion, to underestimate some people the charm of the street in their current state. 
He said, the best years of my life, were in the places that were dark, moist and disgusting.
