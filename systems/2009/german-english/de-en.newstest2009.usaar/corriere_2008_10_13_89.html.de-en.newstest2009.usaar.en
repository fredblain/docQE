The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon as the chamber of deputies against which in 700 billion - dollar saving - parcel of the White House voted had already few days ago manifested itself: One large part of the Americans was and more is at that interested Wall Street to punish as the economy to save. 
This confirms the edition of the New York Times that reports about that, divided as the crisis in the run the republican party that divides itself up in their old and moderate East cobough soul more and more, of yesterday that always favored the state institutions and the business community and that neoconservative, that "those in Washington" and the of world finance hostile faces and before a. in the South and the centre of the states electorate wins. 
This part of the party owes his rise before a. the voice of that, that I above-mentioned. 
Meanwhile this just mentioned example is only a small part of the great modifications which the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, also in the whole West and maybe will be also beyond these concerned by these. 
Both in the states and in Europe the crisis seems to speed up the long feared events which accept take shape under these new conditions at last and come onto to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard Renaissance of the state, in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy. 
In Fact the crisis means a decline of the banking and financial institutions, which close links to the outside have and at the same time an enormous amount of assets from private households that lives in a single state manage. 
This means a direct political problem for the governments: indeed as it is to behave opposite the affected families necessary, which yes also one enormous electoral measures represent. 
The crisis appears therefore economically global, political on the other hand it is almost in that national. 
The political internationalism seems so to have gotten into marginalised in and to have lost be allowed at itself: The obvious evidence for that was given by the EU, not to find which one due to their division in various national and international conflicts a common way white. 
Therefore calculate now all with the intervention of their own state; Rescue plans, new rules, and before a. distribution of aid fund: Since the crisis became increasingly more serious only the United States are in the economic situation to escape without foreign aid. 
And next to the resources they in addition have also the legitimacy these use: thus two conditions not too überwertende - under certain circumstances -, onto which ones else is not an international organisation and not a market in a similar way will be able to go back. 
That new emphasis which is put onto the public - national element is by the way in perfect unison with the increasingly greater importance which recently is brought in the economy with a sector allied onto the narrowest in touch: to The territoriality. 
Paradoxical way is to just have joined a cross-linked entire empire it now when we were nevertheless so convinced by that for a long time, into an empire of the always refined technologies, the immaterial one, that we must find out at the same time how nevertheless our future will depend on the things in an essential way physical more and more: 
Water, harvest and oil. These can be transported to the other one of the world certain indeed all of a place, nevertheless are awake, however, utmost united with a closely paraphrased piece of earth - a territory. 
Therefore that one that has a such territory is to another that lives in a field harvest - free, water - free or free from oil reserves opposite to advantage. 
I come now to the second innovation to presuppose, however a brief insertion. 
Who territory, who government, who says policy, says too leadership in this way. 
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand the knowledge is white to that one there around the necessity of Leaderships looked at, that is the demand for somebody, as one controls the things. 
On the Other Hand now a wave of the indignation about the existing leadership exists, before a. those of the economics that turned out as inadequately and fully blind sectors. 
Finally in addition a deep aspect sufficing and worrying in some ways still comes: A confidence loss, an Unduldsamkeit, a picture of the whilst, a feeling of the distance which is directed itself towards a whole class all from managers of the western countries. 
Seems to clear like this the conviction under large parts of the population the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content the majority than always other and überkommener represent. 
The demand for Leadership nourishes in a therefore underground way a branched but powerful movement of the Entmachtung of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in sudden "Revolts" this voters and in the unprovided change of the collective state of mind of the last time: beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the breakdown of the Labour Party in Britain, there for the rebellion of the American members against George Bush (and maybe also the victory plays the rights in Italy here a role). 
One gains the impression as if the old elite has their parties their programmes, but also their Riten, journals, intellectual creditors, to some would become say to her format, more and more sense problems and therefore less representative value concerning what nowadays goes before itself in the lower social classes of the West and still amplifies from the financial crisis and is driven up to the Überdimensionalität. 
in the face of all of this would be it in a simple way exaggerated, of one "rebel ion the Massen" to speak. 
Holding the eyes far openly, however, is not meanwhile surely.
