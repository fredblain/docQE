For the Olympic Games the streets are deficient in Madrid. 
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some olympic disciplines in Madrid after the failing for 2012, nevertheless it can be in maybe 2016. 
But I ask to myself: ` are we for that prepares'? 
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets I say that it is not right! 
It was designated as a perfect street, and according to in my opinion, she was the worst street with all for that and at that there was. 
That is natural a lot of rubbish if one paid attention to the assessment and I could check it something like that would not have come through unambiguously. 
But, let's go through from the outset onto everything. 
The nonsense begins with the ticket - getting that allows you when first go. 
It does not seem to me either to be bad, however if they make you already go ahead, they should give you also everything then (including crisp, in order to avoid the jams on the road). 
Therefore nevertheless not. 
Here they make you get just the ticket (the first nonsense to consist in going there only therefore) and (to a never-ending queues) there the surprise is! There was only the satirical T-shirt like in the size 'it' (a second nonsense, because I need the size XL) 
where do we live actually? 
Or is it so that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts of less substance? 
Therefore good, matters like these are a small thing in comparison with the days on the street. 
already had a queue of at least 15 minutes is, foreseen of one having to go very early in order to get the chip, and, in addition, one must forget the schoolbag. 
The queuing lasted more than 35 minutes what is unintelligible in the case of a street, where 11 000 people are expected. 
Finally, as it was also to be expected, the streets caught at and we had not made our moving - bags lie before that even if it had succeeded once, but to fetch it back would be already more difficult. 
In addition looked it, in these 40 minutes of waiting for rain, so that it resulted in the temptation, to organize a popular uprising and to raid the cottage. 
I believe, some 500 people become tomorrow certainly pneumonia have united and as I to become because of this crisp that I got not even to appear punctual during the classification, I can think already that the outcome was stamped wrongly. 
Natural, if one asked me for a perfect Road, I would never remember this road. 
So I believe, we will dream still long about a city that is good for the Olympic Games prepared
