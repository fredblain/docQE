Free view - The orwellsche speech of Barrick Gold 
Le Devoir published in its edition of the 17th September a letter of Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian gold mine Barrick Gold. 
This confirms, and hunts in this case a Orwellian, that the largest gold extraction society of the world strove for a libel destitute publishing house more than six million against three authors and one small, with the destination, to start 'transparent debate' one ` public. 
if it is right that the judges are independent and impartial, then they judge not the truth, particularly not in the case of slander complaints, but the law. 
As expects, this fundamental difference was completely hidden by Mr Garver. 
Because for Barrick Gold it is to lead the kind, best to drive everyone into the ruin that dares to represent an opinion countered theirs with public debate one. 
Very same as the process goes out that authors and the editor of the book considerable sums that are paid to of the gold mine from the almost inexhaustible pockets will have to distribute noir Canada in order to prepare their defence and to fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers. 
The tactic in these unequal fight is by the way often to ruin the defenders in order to force an agreed regulation that makes the other side mouth - dead and in addition deters everyone that risks it renewed with the question to deal. 
If in fact Barrick Gold wanted a public debate, she would have had to present their vision of things before the of public opinion. 
In the contrast to what in many that one is to countries in which Barrick Gold works gang und g√§be debates are usually delivered in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not through stick blows. 
It would have sufficed therefore, when the gold mine their books and files disclosed and would have opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent checking - teams that could have brought light into this issue. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to have no confidence into the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to in support of the authors aside from noir Canada with a hand. 
Mr Garver could declare maybe, as it simultaneously about one ` public 'Debate can ask and to disregard but the views very this in this case? 
Apparently this word contains in the world of the vice-presidents only the on a large-scale paid attorneys, and not the community all Canadians; a very beautifully restricted viewpoint of the term. 
In a democracy even the detractors have to speak the right. 
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or not wants to understand - it is that the public that supports the authors and editors of noir Canada does this particularly therefore because she refuses the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
This public is ready for listening to Barrick and judging, however, on the basis of a civilized replacement of arguments, and not in a framework, which many perceive as silence complaint (in the course this' public debate 'has Barrick Gold just a request addressed to the authors from noir Canada, in which it demands from them, not to use this term more.). 
Foreseen from the surrealen speech from Mr Garver, the complaint of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the Wahrheitsfindung that are fundamental for any democratic society. 
She completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss about facts and interpretations which form the basis of the intellectual work. 
To investigate issues, when it is impossible in a country like Canada, and to discuss, which the rich do this world do not like, who otherwise can do that then? 
If in fact Barrick Gold wanted a public and open debate, it could lead these in her following the scientific norms which were used by the authors of noir Canada. 
It has a right to answer. 
To get the on-campus environment to which we belong, white for a long time, debates and inconsistencies in the control and to solve conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold shows clearly that she does not have no desire for a transparent debate, unlike what she sets. 
This is a loss for the university world, just the same as for the public debate, and it becomes time that the governments take measures that restrict this kind of unwarranted complaints.
