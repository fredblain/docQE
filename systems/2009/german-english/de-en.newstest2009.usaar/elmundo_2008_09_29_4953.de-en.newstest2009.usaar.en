Talking in the sleep 
Some children speak at night 
I mean not those ones who wake up and tell something which happened on the day in front of that to us in this case, but the children who speak during the sleep. 
If it happens to you for the first time, most at best you will have been scared, but in the reality that does not have any importance. 
That is a positive sleep disturbance which is mentioned the speech in the sleep. 
It is quite spread, particularly with among children and young people. 
Certainly, it was told to more than one by you that you spoke at night. 
This phenomenon can occur sometimes (once in the life, for example, how during the high fever), or regular (every day, a time per week, once a month), on the next day the child can not remember anything. 
There is not any only reason which causes this phenomenon. 
Often links with other phenomena are searched in the sleep, as nightmares, panic-stricken fear at night, Enuresis noctura (Bed - Wet at night), searched are in the sleep, however there is not any reason for that. 
How we mentioned it already formerly, it can lie at very high fiber, stress situations or excessive demands. 
In Any Case, that is a little bit investigated phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it appears is very variable. 
It can be that one speaks calmly in individual words whispers or it can completely be an opposite (Shouts, wines long debates). 
In the cases if the comment is very intense it is recommended to observe the child that causes fear and is achieved in this way and to make be advised with a specialist in order to check whether there is a problem. 
We said that it is a positive disruption, therefore it is not handled, it is united with another sleep trouble, which can be handled (for example, with the Schlaf-Apnoe or with the stress). 
What one can do is, one series of simple preventative measures would go on: 
Attempt not to excite the child before the sleeping. 
Therefore, calm game for the child select and stressige channels that terribly and a little are too wild avoid. 
With the nervous children who expansions are recommended to extension methods in order to help them to get a certain amount inner calm can be used. 
That helps the child with sleeping calmly. 
If the talk occurs in the sleep once, attempts to preserve the rest. 
Thinks, that it is harmless for the child and on the next day will not be able to remember anything that happened. 
Useful advice 
Do not wake it on. 
That is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it from the sleep. 
Although the child speaks, sleeps it, therefore it rests. 
Think of that if it is proved according to a few phenomena ver√§ngstigt, so it is recommended to make oneself be advised or to find out what is the reason the baby has for the fear. 
if they understand what does not say it (what is not so usual), the child does not put under pressure, in order to carry out an interrogation and to figure out more information. 
So you will not be able to achieve anything in this way, because if the baby sleeps, is unconscious it and can not think about that. 
In addition, you will hear what says it, but you will not know what dreams it and why it says that, therefore they are cautious with the interpretation of the information and that ends that draws her from that. 
Maybe, do not say it to the child, that to hear you that at night and to know his secrets. 
Not even as joke. 
That causes a lot of fear. 
Therefore, does not do you no concerns, it is not anything bad, that is a moment that lasts only a few minutes.
