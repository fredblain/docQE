01 arrived. The pride and the strains in the life of the black population, in a city in the very particular kind of 
a calm city in which the pride and the complications of the Afro - American culture come is, a few miles remote of the twinkling, loud and gigantic driving, hidden between the outgrowths of leisure parks within a radius of Orlando. 
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home town Zora Neale Hurstons, is more as simply not to be described as Hurston did it in 1935: "this city with 5 lakes, three croquet places, 300 brown skins 300 good swimmers do, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison. 
Nowadays it is a pilgrim place. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Come festival in Eatonville around the most famous authoress of the Harlem Renaissance commemorate. 
And nevertheless is and the city that describes it stays - and that they did to a tourist place of excursions, when she incorporated it into the Florida tour guide, that to the times of economic recession was produced of the federal writer project's - in a lot respect a place of very specific variety. 
Eatonville is so independently, solidly and privately as in the 1930ern when Hurston wrote that rural black municipalities often refused to share their true idea with the white man in Florida this "so little white about us, that he does not know what escapes it. 
Even nowadays, in a year in that a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, to one open conversation about race circumstances calls, it keeps on being many here, to be observed by mavericks. 
"we are considered very on that as our history told becomes", so Hortense Jones, 59, from birth at a resident of the city and parishioner of the oldest church of the city. 
It must be right. " 
a long time was defined as a Paradox of triumph and the fight to Eatonville. 
It is both a historic example of the black movement and a municipality of almost 2.400 inhabitants in which the poverty line is twice as high as the national average. 
On the one hand it a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example is that one - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, that has their roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising, that people here both proud than are also on the guard. 
And so correctly the concerns began around Eatonville 'it image actually with Zora, as here all Hurston name. 
She introduced their home town in books that came of heart and was written in either to the world so as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) 
Five heels in the Florida guide changed the city that suits to the route 77 very near a road that through the oft - forgotten center of Florida leads, to the scenes of black history and human tragedy. 
Insolently as Oskar both in real life and in the literature, Hurston Leser to the shop of Eatonvilles led first mayor, Joe Clarke, and turned then to more private matters. 
"off the road to the left", she wrote ", were the brown - painted modern school, with its leafy gardens and playgrounds which Howard Miller always sees to although he can hardly read and write, knows. 
She mentioned also the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "Drinks of any kind sells and was-auch-immer to time areas fits." 
Only in just a few hundred words Hurston brought therefore Eatonville with self-government in combination, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was not a tour guide ganz sicher. 
In Fact this was not a portrait which was valued by all of them. 
"Zora the things described so, wie sie waren", so the 90 - year old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls the Hurston immortalized, when them the men the songs about which sang their beauty that was fuller sexual innuendo summoned. 
She added: "Some people did not like this." 
One remembers here still Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin who returned regularly after the family had moved according to Jacksonville, Florida. 
Augustus of Rome Franklin 77, remembered, that if Hurston came into the city roaredly, they this mostly without warning did, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in trousers in a city the even today something onto their venerable clothing style imagines. 
According to Mr Franklin the majority of inhabitants were fascinated, wohingegen many it despised. 
"this people were always glad Zora to sight", Mr Franklin said. 
but "sie stayed never too longest", he added while it was swinging in his chair, on a to the back sited terrace that looks at the Sabelia See in which Hurston was christened according to all probability. 
When Hurston died in 1960 it was poor and its books out of print. 
Together with the bulk of the world it seemed to have forgotten to Eatonville. 
Although she was a famous author once, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard college in the 1920ern, she became in fort Pierce, Florida, where it lived, buried in an unmarked grave. 
In Eatonville there was not no great ceremony, no public readings in the big style. 
"I thinks not, that they was published your contribution in the world or their heritage in the least understood credit", so Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography above Hurston the 2003. 
The turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted to put a fünfspurige motorway through the city in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main road of the community. 
Orlandos suburbs had pushed already the motorway 4 through the western outskirts of a town. 
The proposal was made when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in its history. 
Mandatory integration, among other things, had put an end the relatively idyllic isolation to the community. 
In the fifties the fight brought hatred against racial mixing into the community. 
"In this time a bunch of white boys came often and they flung oranges and stuff onto those ones off sitting people", Mr Franklin said. 
"it even once a woman gave the in this case was killed. 
You flung a watermelon from the car. " 
In 1955 Orlando Sentinel questioned Hurston in a writing onto that the demand of the Uppermost Court of Justice to force integration when they described his decision in the case Brown against the school council as "offensive instead of my race respecting". 
Residents say nowadays, that although the lifting of racial segregation was in a way positive, they the group cohesion in Eatonville and self-assurance its young people weakened. 
"Black children were accustomed it, to be embraced - I remember that - one embraced his teacher at on the morning and one embraced his teacher at the evening", so N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managerial directress of the non-profit group to the protection of the Eatonville Gemeinschaft. 
That could be received for so long erectly, she added until teachers and pupils did not come from the same place anymore. 
"One did not embrace his white teachers, because he was a white teacher - I mine there is a cultural divide available", Ms Nathiri said ". 
However, the civil rights contributed to place being created for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists, that disregarded prejudices, so as she did it, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "as can refuse somebody the joy of my society! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975 the writer Alice Walker onto the path turned herself into Hurstons nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of their fame. 
An a lot praised Hurston-Biographie of Robert E. Hemenway was to be found five years later in the bookshelves, and made it renewed to a part of the American literature canon. 
The distance route project came exactly at a time, in the Eatonvilles most famous daughter again once in the light of the stood. 
And this time Hurstons old neighbors saw her as a Retterin. 
The community began festival in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston in order to show what the district with the construction of the motorway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and each January many return for the celebration. 
A few years later the district averted itself from his road construction plans. 
"this plans of a fünfspurigen distance route livened up the city, sped up the whole thing with top speed, woke genuine Citizen proud", Ms Nathiri said. 
Ms Boyd a little more simply squeezed it out: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the distance route project contributed to a modification of the selfpicture of the city. 
More and more Zugereiste came, so as Rachelle Munson, an attorney that goes into the church since 1993 here, and local began to estimate the past new. 
Eatonville was incorporated in 1998 into the national historic register. 
A new one-storeyed library (named after Hurston of course) opened in 2006 on the again paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard. 
Nowadays Eatonville still is a special feature in Florida: just 6 miles from the city center of Orlandos it can feel sometimes as a rear lane in the summer rains, as small as then than it was founded only by 27 black families in the 1880ern. 
(It is nowadays black to 90%.) 
External ones in search of the history Eatonvilles and its importance are handled often still with caution. 
For most interviews a approval in the run-up to is necessary and certain things - so as the wall painting of Eatonvilles of oldest church which was painted from a white and represents black men during the work in the fields - must not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Ms Jones, a courageous, teacher, selfconscious that their shielded community is misunderstood, with a penchant for Dunkelrot, fear still. 
And nevertheless, at the same time to which the Hurston-Festival became bigger, also an increased degree at internal pride was born. 
Particularly young people tend to seeing Eatonville like this as Hurston saw your whole race: wonderful, with all its problems, neither worse even better and just as proud, creative and industrious, fool around and mixes as any other race and nation group in America. 
It is the genuine love for this city that one in the voice of gentlemen Franklins nephew can hear, the 18 - year old Edwin Harvey that plans to return to the college according to Eatonville that could use some help according to it in order to work in the City Council or near the police. 
And even the juniors, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven year old twins from winter park, learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"this most people, that only think here gone on become:" Ach, this city is not anything in comparison with all the other ", Alondra Kenon said recently on Sunday after the church. 
"but if in fact one stops and its history long considers a moment, it is a very beautiful city.
