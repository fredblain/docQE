The letter - A dishonored country 
Mr Vic Töws, EX - 'justice' - Minister (which irony) it was in the cabinet Harper, that last summer was taken to say above Louise Arbour the liberty it is one 'Disgrace' for Canada. 
This woman, not to end ones wanting fight for the justice has led and earned all our admiration to cover so with outrage so much testifies about the people the prime minister, as above Stephen Parker itself. 
We have to do it here with a government, that than only from all the affected countries their compatriot caught in concentration camps Guantanamo not home has gotten. 
A government which not even considers that Omar Khadr was still a young man when the things which he is reproached for happened. 
The single government, that in spite of the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and makes a child soldiers vegetate under inhumane conditions. 
To assess the only one who lowers itself to a justice parody around the fault of the defendants. 
We call ourselves into remember, that especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers plead for getting Omar Khadr home so that he gets a fair trial in Canada. 
Exactly this government shuts also the eyes in front of torture: It interests her little that a young adult will have broken after so many years the ordeal certainly forever psychologically. 
We are not yet conscious of that to ourselves, but we experience just an insidious curtailment of our rights here our freedom and ours' democracies', this word that supports to Harper here continuously as a flag for itself, and that rings from his mouth so meaninglessly. 
The time in which there is not no morality more came therefore: One may maltreat a Canadian citizens randomly, torment a Canadian citizen and lock up a Canadian citizen, completely according to discretion of a head of the government that is supported only by the minority until today (he completely likes to belong after the 14th October to minority...). 
Many voters believe to find their salvation near a party which preaches about virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government renounced of what defined the reputation and dignity of our country. 
The disgrace, Mr Töws, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere different.
