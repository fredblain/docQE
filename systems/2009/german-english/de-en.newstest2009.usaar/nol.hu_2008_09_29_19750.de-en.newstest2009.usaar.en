CSU: 
Grace for a limited time At the end of October the fate of the fallen duet Huber-Beckstein is decided on 
In spite of the electoral collapse yet no heads roll in the meantime, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the staff debates were adjourned. 
Party chief Erwin Huber and prime minister Beckstein still stay in their offices, the question is only how long this grace lasts. 
The fate of the tandem according to the catastrophic 17 - prozentigen loss of vote is decided on at the last weekend in october during at the special party conference. 
The duet called a lot made already look through, however, that it would not like to stick to their chairs. 
In this way they want to calm the annoyed parliamentary party and the party basis, that a day after this "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of the absolute majority personal consequences required. 
Five years ago - added, under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber standing at his career peak - the Christian Social Union reached another 60,7 percent. Now, however, a year after the coup against Stoiber they could safeguard only 43,4 percent of the vote. 
The CSU was 46 years long "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria, which erwirtschaftet 18 per cent of the German GDP. 
The conservatives remain indeed the determining strength in the also for the Hungarian economy important southern province, will have to rule, however, in the future in a coalition. 
As a first sign of the party - intern restructuring the potential successor Hubers is bound vice-president and Bundesagrarminister thicket Seehofer also into the research team that with the liberal FDP, and/or the rechtsgerichteten "Freien voter" Exploratory talk about a possible Munich coalition leads. 
It amounts to an irony of fate, that with that one list "Free voter" that Gabriele Pauli into the legislature enters, that the Huber-Beckstein Duo exploited Anti-Stoiber appearance first in order to rid oneself of the determined politician mercilessly then. 
The CSU - management concentrates now all its energies on the stabilization Becksteins. 
In this transitional process an active role will be attributed to Stoiber which up to now pulled the threads out of the light. The former prime minister and CSU chairperson mentioned 28 September the most "bitter day of his political". 
On on Monday Huber did a few poisonous remarks in the direction of CDU - according to his opinion the CSU would have earned more support far from the sister party. 
Other CSU - politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal onto the CDU and in this way also at Angela Merkel. 
if the CSU which contributed to the success a lot in 2005 also on national level should not be put on its feet with a common effort again, Merkel can not become chancellor again after the election of the Bundestag in September 2009. 
Merkel who did not do no secret from their disappointment at the fiasco believes that the losing ground of the CSU will not affect the grand coalition negatively in Berlin. 
What, however, is relative: The injured CSU will not be to be governed more easily, and meanwhile the crisis of the social democrats goes on. 
With 18,6 percent the SPD achieved her so far best result in Bavaria since 1946.
