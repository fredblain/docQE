Even rats have feelings 
A rat or a cockroach flees in the case of danger is said that, that she feels also fear? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: To have also a lot animals feelings. 
Only how could one check whether they feel the same thing if they behave similarly as we? 
in the internet journal "Edge" became published since several years of contributions of famous scientists. 
MIRROR ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to those ones question "what you hold for true, to be able to prove without it? 
I believe that animals have feelings and other awareness states without otherwise I or somebody being able to prove this up to now where we can not even prove that other people have awareness. 
However, in this case we may hope at least since all human brains show the same basic configuration. 
As soon as we turn to other species, however, and touch questions of the opinion or generally more of consciousness, we enter unwegsames ground because the hardware does not agree. 
If a rat in danger takes, she does the same thing as many other animals: She surrenders in a dead way, flees or attacks. 
People behave similarly, to close from which some scientists onto a comparable subjective experience. 
I do not believe in that, however. 
Two aspects of the brain structural make it difficult to apply our subjective experience to that from animals. 
On the one hand the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the side prefrontal Cortex (because of his participation in the short-term memory and at the Ausfuehrungs - / control functions). 
This broad region is much more highly developed with the human being than with the remaining primates and seems with other creatures to be missing entirely. 
To plan at least with those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex under that the knowledge, who we are, and the ability and to decide, reason to believe exists therefore, that the human being distinguishes even from the other primates. 
A further dramatic character might lie in the linguistic nature of the people: Since a so big part of his experience is combined with language, it is said often the awareness depends on that. 
In this case one could exclude animals. 
However, even if conscience did not depend on language, this would influence it certainly so that animal consciousness as it likes to be also to get it would be distinguished from most of our Bewusstseins-zustaende probably very much. 
Therefore it is heavy to investigate how awareness likes to look at other animals. 
When it, as something Intern and Subjective, neither do not measure yet, because of the specific hardware, analyze by means of our own experience makes, so his research into puts us before major problems. 
Most of my comments refer to the contents of the conscious experience, nevertheless there is next to that another further aspect of the consciousness which might be scientifically more simply accessible. 
One could examine the processes of awareness of animals without regard for their content, and happen exactly that with studies about the short-term memory of primacy, in particular at the example of the visualization. 
However with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed one rather resorts to the neuralen correlatives of consciousness than onto the causal mechanism: Both like to be identical or neither. 
Interestingly enough this approach accentuates also the importance of the prefrontal Cortex for the materialization of the visualization. 
what turns out now for the feelings? 
I would drive it back on an emotional system as that of the fear being activated in a brain, conscious of his own activity. 
What we as "fear" describe, the mental state in which we are if main memory proves the activity of the defence system localized in the brain (or its consequences such as physical reactions) is therefore. 
Feelings are so seen tied to the areas of the Cortex that distinguish primates and in particular the people closely. 
fine varying degrees of the surrenders to Combined with the linguistic nature because we can differentiate situations with the aid of the words and the grammar and categorize states in order to ascribe it also to other ones next to us ourselves. 
On the other hand Antonio Damasio thinks for example that feelings follow from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the Cortex and the brain stem similar to Jaak Pankseep, who concentrates on the brain stem more, however. 
Since this network did not change in the course of human evolution very much, it can be participated in kind - comprehensive feelings absolutely. 
In that in theory I can not contradict that, it holds, however, for unprovable. 
Pankseep argues, what appears with rats and people like fear probably feels so also in two cases: how, however, can one check whether rats and people feel the same thing if they behave similarly? 
A cockroach flees in the case of danger whether also she feels fear? 
In my eyes bare similar behaviour can not prove yet any experience equality. 
Indeed the neurale arrangement keeps on helping: Rats and people have similar brain tribes, cockroaches on the other hand not even a brain. 
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings? 
And even if one could prove that for the people: How did one want to prove it at rats? 
I believe, that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), feelings have. 
But I would not know how I should prove that. 
And because their feelings are presumably distinguished from ours basically (since the human consciousness is based on specific circuits and on language), I investigate more with pleasure the emotional behaviour than the emotional feelings of rats. 
Anyway progress beckons here on the neuralen tier provided that one measures the same thing with rats and people. 
How I do not investigate language and awareness at rats, so neither feelings, I know nevertheless not, whether they exist. 
One likes to hold that for shortsighted, but I come more with pleasure ahead than to walk continuously against a wall. 
I am now more practical emotional ist.
