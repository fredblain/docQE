Do believers have less pain? 
To occupy as latest research, that the religious believe as a kind "analgesic" work, that of Catholic martyrs is supposed to have facilitated already the death. 
Scientists of Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment: It was examined, the British one announced to what extent the believe in God influences the pain view of the people leaf "telegraph". 
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation ever 12 Believers and atheists received electric shocks while they were studying a painting of the Mother God. 
As the results showed the believers could eliminate most of the pain. 
By means of a Hirn-Scan Technologie it could even be proved that the Catholics could activate the part of their brain which is responsible for the pain regulation. 
The investigation was the first in an research project which next to scientists also philosophers and theologians of different sections of the University participate in. 
During the experiment a sparkling device that gave the electric shocks was tied the probands to the left hand. 
The participants were asked for concentrating on two paintings strongly: On the one hand a picture of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other Leonardo there Vincis "ladies with the ermine". 
The researchers hoped, that the sight would cause the virgin Mary among the believers a kind of religious trance, while they were selecting picture to Vincis there, because it was hardly distinguished from the same as the other paintings and because it was felt as calming. 
The trials spent ever half an hour in a MRI scanners, and received in this time a total 20 electric shocks in four stages while they were should notice either the religious one, or the other paintings. 
The Catholics told, they would have themselves with at the sight of the Mother God "out of danger" felt, as if sie "worried" wae ren, and they h√§tten "rest and peace" felt. 
During the considering of the religious painting they reported about 12% less pain, than if they had Leonardos factory before eyes. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias that participated also in the attempt meant, one could cause similar effects also with pictures other, working strongly also with the atheists, one would have to find the photograph bare. 
"We would have to find a picture which activates very positive feelings as such a mother or a father", according to the psychologist. 
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
"this Practise of faith our personality should change, and it does also in many felling", so Wright. 
According to these excellent results only still the question what effect a Madonna - picture of Leonardos or another comparable painter onto the pain regulation of believers would have remains. 
would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
