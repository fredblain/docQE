Dark matter influences flight from space probes 
For years a mysterious phenomenon guarantees near research for doom: The rate of space probes influences dark tissue during so called swing - by - maneuvers. 
Experts fear that the general General Theory of Relativity Albert Einsteins could not be very correct. 
Almost 18 years the space probe "Ulysses" flew through the space. 
Because of soon freezing fuel management the cold death threatens it now. 
Among scientists a mysterious phenomenon guarantees for years for confusion - the swing by anomaly. 
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in the case of which they receive additional momentum in the gravity field of a celestial body such as the Earth. 
Through that the probes can save much fuel. 
The European - American research study Cassini-Huygens used these physical trick just the same as the solar probe Ulysses. 
What amazes the researchers already for years, however, in this case: the as do not behave 100-prozentig so as one would expect it according to the old - venerable law of gravitation. 
Rather it results in irregularities to the speed. 
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower. 
Up to now the physicists could not explain this effect. 
You christened it swing - by - anomaly. 
Some experts fear that even the general theory of relativity could not be very correct possibly to Albert Einsteins, who describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of the area. 
The American physicist Stephen Eagles of the institute for Advanced Study from Princeton believes still firmly in Einstein not wandering, and attempts to explain the swing - by - anomaly with the aid of the so-called dark matter that astronomers defined in the universe. 
"Dark matter" that "could also completely be near of the Earth could be" responsible for the anomaly ", he writes. 
The space researchers do not know about the existence of dark matter before since around some ten years ago. 
An attraction that effect on other celestial bodies can be observed goes out of it obviously. 
She herself is on the other hand completely invisible, that is, it does not send and does not reflect no electromagnetic radiation, in particular is also no visible light. 
After the calculations of scientists the dark matter defines after all well a FÃ¼nftel of the entire mass of the universe.
