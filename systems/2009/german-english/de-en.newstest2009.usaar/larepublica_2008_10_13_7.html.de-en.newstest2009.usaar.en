'Leading' The links' to the arrest of the mayor 'between politics and' Ndrangheta from Gioia Tauro 
"this mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready, to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia groups Piromalli. 
The accusations of the disbarment of the anti-Mafia - authority of Kalabriens against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality Gioia Tauro that this morning was arrested because of involvement in mafia activities are fatal. 
Into taken handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the older agent was taken between the clan and the public administration, as well as that nephew: the attorney that carries the same name as the boss of the clans had been condemned already because of involvement into criminal organisations of the Mafia, then too an indemnity of 10 million euros. 
"every sort of moral and legal standard disregard", so the lawyers write ", to pay the attorney Piromalli Gelder for consultation activities," have the two local administrations decided. 
"Thus it had been made possible for the mafia groups - so the judge - to penetrate town halls on official way and to have a say in the policy of the public administration." 
The president of the regional committee of Kalabriens Agazio Loiero does not deny, that it in its region "everything other than an exception is to bump onto links from local administrations and the organized crime." There are places in which the concentration is greater to of the Mafia than in other ones in which such links are virtually inevitable. 
But there are also local politicians who 'resist' to the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta': Heroes who keep a perfect for themselves. " 
The arrests of this morning follow those of the last July with which according to the police the clan Piromalli was beheaded. 
Since the end of the last April the town council had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro, nevertheless already 1991 - and also then due to alleged combinations between organized crime and the local administration - the local politicians their town councils had been relieved. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected as the head of the middle right coalition according to the run-off election in May 2006. 
He shouted scandal than the police ordered the dissolution of the parish council. 
He prosecuted on that into the Vizeinnenminister Marco Minniti that he accused, all for political - strategic reasons to have invented. The judges but, declare in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Piromalli - clan had even dared to apply for a change of the A3 - project it. 
From a listening - action in connection with the investigations for the case Dal Torrione, the willingness to comply with the wishes of an entrepreneur that a representative is to the large group as is generally known around the Piromalli was proved - through which the measures of public administration became identical with the interests of this clans.
