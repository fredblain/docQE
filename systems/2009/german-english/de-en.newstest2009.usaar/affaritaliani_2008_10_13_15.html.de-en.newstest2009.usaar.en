Obama - the first president? Here a statement 
A known American politician to whom at that being regarded as independent suits a lot wrote: "Barack Obama the second anti-american one becomes president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, that through its decisions, that decimated economy of the United States and that maintained relations with the befeindeten Islam (and does this still today as a private citizen) ". 
The attacks against Obama become increasingly more vehement, just now, where the elections approach. 
A lady from Miami wrote in an internet page: "This person is fully ambitions. 
Obama is very insolent: it thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation, that a total two black governors has seen and "five black senators"!. 
Actually these attacks do not have to say, however, much; it is a question of racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the opinion polls; they all say that Obama with a big lead will win. 
Also in this case people are there, that with that heart and not with the head speak. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in deepest south of the United States, wrote in theirs in the editorial: first in the voting booths we will know presumably to whom the genuine American patriot will give his voice. 
Here a mentality of the United States appears, that to last hidden was held. 
"It says what you want, then we will decide for whom we will do our Kreuchen, whether for Obama or for McCain". 
There are people that swear over there: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America. 
Something that one did not hear never before - first now, where the success seems of the black candidate so secure. 
Onto all cases despite all these, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 people were consulted: What mistake did Bush commit during his tenure? 89% have answered: 
the war in Iraq. 
America changes. The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent with a step to the behind again home. 
In Iraq 4 500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack. 
In spite of that, Iraq remains of the weakness of Bush for the majority. 
That one which will take its place stands before a huge task.
