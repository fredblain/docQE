The first virtual service providers comes already this year to Czech Republic. 
Maybe 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic matured right, the Czech providers offer virtually all services as they are offered also by their partners in Western Europe. 
In spite of that something is missing here - a virtual service providers, that forces the classical to lower prices. 
Maybe this anymore long one will be able to be maintained on itself. 
That the Czech car phone providers to the most expensive in Europe work anyway, we already often reported about that on Mobil.cz. 
This confirmed after all also the telecommunications authority TÚ which on that it made attentive that of the price is here higher for a SMS than in the rest of the European Union. 
According to the last steps of the European commission in the field regulation of the Roaminggebühren it comes to a paradoxical situation so probably too - for some customers of the Czech instance SMS will be cheaper from the foreign country than at home. 
how does it come that the prices are so high in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, it the competition that in fact does a challenge is missing. 
Maybe it rings paradoxically, nevertheless in the Czech Republic there are three land mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%. 
On the other hand the car phone providers swear about there being a lot of competition on the Czech market extremely with pleasure. 
To the often also the chairperson of the council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority () Pavel Dvoák pflichtet, that had expressed in the past often, that there is not any place in the Czech Republic for another supplier. 
It makes probable that a classic providers with a own network does not have many opportunities more particularly (after all he would also hardly yet probably find frequencies). 
There is, however still a possibility - a virtual service providers. 
Just the entry of virtual providers on the mobile market brought a clear mark-down with themselves which then the classic instance had to react to. 
In this case there were still similar votes before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile onto the market in United Kingdom as in Czech Republic. 
It, however, it proved that there is place for such providers and that these can be in fact successful. 
After all one does not need to search long for examples. 
To have this in In February we reported about the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland. 
Only in just a half year this providers succeeded in winning more than 100 thousand customers and climbing up so to the five - tallest provider of the country. 
The financial group of Penta which has U:fon among other things in Czech Republic supports Mobilking in this case. 
fon has. The advantage of virtual suppliers consists in this case in one being able to concentrate on a much more specific target. 
In order to be able to function effectively virtual service providers need indeed a lot of less customers as a classic suppliers. 
You do not need indeed not a relatively high cost for the building, the company and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In the world the virtual service providers usually distinguish themselves so as Low-Cost companies out - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, what, however, often of one little is accompanied extensive portfolio of services. 
So Tesco Mobile offers for example SMS more cheaply in Great Britain at least around half than its competitors do. 
How, however the example points from Mobilking in Poland can be also a move, quite good to back on a target audience not klischeehafte. 
these providers consults men in an indeed particular way. 
"Echte fellows choose Mobilking - the provider, which they like and that they trust ability", so David Seibert, the chief executive of the Mobile entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual prey. 
Heavy to say whether a similar concept could grip as in terminals also in the Czech Republic get a foothold. 
Also the press officers of Vodafone Miroslav doubts about that epický: "this Czech market is for a market segment which most virtual providers base on, relatively small. 
In addition it is relatively satisfied from the viewpoint of the services. " 
In the Czech Republic chance - free, the car phone providers mean 
It is, however, almost secure that this will not be Mobilking if a virtual instance conquers the Czech Republic. 
"we to talk indeed about an expansion this successful project, nevertheless in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopefully. 
It rather becomes a market entry of Mobilking in other countries our region kommen ", so says in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz Jana Studniková, press officers of the financial group of Penta. 
Indirectly she confirmed so that the current instance are to this idea particularly not inclined in the Czech Republic. 
On the contrary, they attempt to do everything for not a potential competitor arising. 
Your interest at a start of a virtual car phone provider shows already since some time the group to GTS Novera that would like to do a further step in order to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area company customers. 
"we a great interest in that have, our customers not only Fixed Network -, but to offer also car phone telecommunication services. 
And each formerly, all the better. 
About this opportunity we repeated with all Czech costs negotiates. 
With some of them we "could" achieve "already negotiation progress", according to the press officers of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Maybe now better times come. 
It follows from No official information that maybe the first virtual service providers is to be expected until the end of the year. 
Up to now, however, this of a insurmountable wall of silence is surrounded. 
"in this moment we go out not, that in the Czech Republic place exists for a full virtual providers. 
The Czech market shows great specifics opposite other markets. 
Up to now has us still no subject with a complex and serious project in this area address ", means in his declaration for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Srse from the press department of Telefónica O2. 
also other providers refer to the nature of the Czech market. 
The press officers of t - mobile Martina Kemrová matches in rare with the statement from O2: "up to now we have still not found any viable and both ways useful project which one would keep on being able to build on. 
And she adds: "in the network from t mobile hardly a virtual service providers will emerge until the end of the year. 
In this moment we would have to have been there already a specific offer in order to be able to think so for a short period of time. " 
Vodafone rather focuses its attention on the fulfillment of the demands of the own 3G-Lizenz. 
Miroslav epický means for this purpose: "for negotiations with potential virtual suppliers we are open, in particular in the field division of costs and infrastructure. 
Just to consider this we from the viewpoint of the customers as the best. 
The key strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in the search for a partner to the construction of a divided net for a rapid mobile Internet. 
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand 
The actions of the instance is to be understood easily, a further provider would be called more competition, this would lead to prices to be sunk also to a reduction in the profits and through that. 
Why therefore one should facilitate the entering market for a such competitors? 
also the long one proves Back And Forth that the supplier can pull at pull together if it is a question of something around the origin of U:fon. 
fon. the Probably strongest pressure in direction went at this time, as U: fon onto the market came, from society when. 
also publicly accessible information from the prove that. 
Now, however, itself just has U: fon as an argument, why one should not admit a virtual service providers. 
Martina Kemrová commented on that: "this competitive environment of the mobile telephone market was in addition still strengthened recently by the market entry of a fourth car phone provider. 
Considering the character of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic it is obvious that a new player would make high demands on the market itself and especially its services. " 
Faced with this approach the instance the absolute indifference of the Czech regulators amazes, however. 
It is not only a question dabei in order to intervene the attitude of the TÚ that does not have the competence unfortunately in Czech - unlike Great Britain and further highly developed states - into the economic competition. 
This has exclusively the office to the protection of the economical competition (ÚOHS). 
This, however, got its very typical attitude for this whole issue. 
"this market entry of a virtual car phone provider would be then possible, after it resulted in a contract conclusion between a instance and a virtual service providers about the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
Up to now no such treaty was not closed, because the supply of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional operators ", so in his answer to our inquiry Kristián Chalupa of the department external relations of the ÚOHS. 
From representatives of the supplier such a formulation would not surprise. 
From an authority which is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and to see nobody misuses his position on the market to it among other things this is more than dubious. 
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual service providers in a very normal way work, it is to be observed that their market contributed to a price reduction with mobile telephone services." 
Probably, however, belong the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price not for the interests of the ÚOHS. 
Real shocking at this case the almost already moving unison of the three instance that results from their reactions is. 
The question whether it is a question only of a coincidence in fact lies on the hand. 
Just the same as the absolutely same price of petrol at the petrol stations secure only a coincidence and the result of a tough competition is. 
"this authority did not discover in this matter any signs that indicate an action directed towards the competition, and thus she does not have also any reason to intervene in the matter in any way. 
No one of the supplier has a dominant market position, thus he does not have either the corresponding increased responsibility for his actions on the market. 
also the regulator probably lacks the necessary instruments for an aperture of the mobile telephone market to virtual service providers for telecommunication ", Chalupa mentioned in its statement. 
The interpretation of the dominating position on the market is one of many points in dispute. 
Of course there is an analysis of the relevant markets, elaborated by the TÚ, to which telecommunications is a single market from the viewpoint of the economic competition. 
On such a market no one of the Czech instance holds then of course a dominating position. 
Some legal experts but, offer a different vision - for the market entry of a virtual supplier always the approval of the network operator with is necessary. 
And the instance has this monopoly - logically - for its network. 
That one means that it takes a dominating position in a particular segment of necessity. 
Even if one, however, does not accompany with this argument, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three instance go ahead strikingly similarly. 
In this case complaints of a number of interested parties prove (including the mentioned society GTS Novera) that they find a very similar obstacles in the case of negotiations with all providers. 
The Abwälzung of the blame on the is then a quite usual trick with which the ÚOHS distanziert of the whole matter in the telecommunication services. 
This was to be observed already in a number similar cases. 
Unfortunately did not succeed in putting through the enlargement of the powers of the into the novelette of the telecommunications law recently said goodbye onto the field of economic competition in the telecommunication although a number of experts had expected to improve the situation of that. 
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know that only far too well, however, probably they have other interests. 
It works already if nobody hinschaut 
The functioning of any of pseudovirtual providers from whom there are several in the Czech mobile networks now remains unseen first once. 
There are companies which issue own schedules of prices for mobile telecommunications services which, however, are only in part public. 
Usually it is a question indeed of companies which act in the field multilevel - marketing. 
their own mobile telephone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and other ones. 
The lists these companies succeeded usually only to chosen ones. 
The joke of the matter consists in the company acting as a classical company customer who makes onto SIM cards an appointment with a large amount opposite the operator. 
As important customer he receives specific quotations (and other offers) then. 
The problem consists in the conditions of all Czech instance forbidding a similar resale. 
there "should" be "cases that you describe, then it can be a question of an injury of the contractual conditions" which "we will occupy ourselves" with "then, which can lead to a termination of cooperation with the relevant society", Martina Kemrová answered our question on this problem. 
Something like that is quite unlikely to itself not to get about with the leaders of the instance, however. 
In particular in the case of the three mentioned companies it can be a question of thousands of customers. 
No operator opposes, however an such approach. 
From the activity of these firms flow them profits indeed not to be neglected, simultaneously they are not influenced - unlike the real virtual suppliers - by the real official marketing. 
Onto potential problems Miroslav makes epický attentive: "this law facilitates such kinds of speculation, for all that the services of these companies only of a very small percentage of customers are used. 
These must in addition accept that the SIM-Karte does not work onto your name in their telephone, they can not have therefore that genuinely as the normal customers of the instance. 
Already only that, however, the TÚ would have to occur at least strangely. 
In addition a further question opens up for the ÚOHS. 
The car phone providers shut the eyes to an such approach, why they jib at a virtual providers? 
It is to be added that the ÚOHS for to the discovery of such activities has right strong powers and if it does not want, does not have to zufriedengeben with the declaration of the providers they would not know anything of that and their business conditions would forbid this. 
When Czech Republic is not more expensive 
As in the text already repeatedly was stressed, the market entry of virtual service providers brought a sharp price drop with the different services with themselves. 
Where in all countries virtual service providers virtually arose in this case, attempted the traditional operators, whose to prevent emergence virtually more or less. 
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - a market in a too smaller way, and/or too very satisfied, problems with the quality of services and so forth. 
In the highly developed countries but, the regulatory bodies intervened just in these times, that by no means the interests of the instance, but to preserve that of their customers attempted. 
It is through formal measures or nonformal pressure, they achieved, that the first virtual operator arose, and this followed wider. 
Unfortunately the Czech regulatory bodies throw the whole case to themselves as a hot potato. 
Departing from our experience we can not rid ourselves from the impression that problem is more than favorable in the powers in these cases. 
Nevertheless we do not fling the gun into the granule. 
If the background information are right and soon a virtual service providers emerges the Czech mobile market will maybe soon move itself again. 
If a supplier approves the origin of a virtual car phone provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive if it is a question of refusing other interested parties (to discriminate). 
And the Czechs will not phone then more expensively at last than the rest of Europe will.
