Team record through series in the second quarter aufgestellr 
Inside defender Shaun Ellis thought that he would have seen everything after it in the last ones achteinhalb years more often than everyone other in the jet shirt accumulated. 
Then he saw on Sunday the second quarter in which the jets changed an unsuccessful game into a triumph train. 
"I have never yet seen something like that", Ellis said. 
After one slovenly game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals that corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began. 
When however Quarterback Brett Favres passport with Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard-Touchdown marked arrived, that the perfect prelude to an afternoon at that their developing cooperation a giant leap forward did. 
Favre found Coles in this quarter for another two Touchdowns, the one time as an outside defender slipped and that other once 10 seconds in front of the end of the half. 
"I has me not especially tire", Coles about the passports says that to Coles went. 
"he a superplayer is. 
Our vote tuned regardless what the people think. " 
While Favre and Coles were playing call tracing the defence took Quarterback Kurt Warner from each other. 
Outside defender Darrelle Revis caught a verungl√ºckten throw and changed it into a 32-Yard-Touchdown. 
Spare man Erik Smith came onto a different passport and caught it. 
Linebacker David Bowens guaranteed then for a loss of warner. 
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the maddest. 
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds remaining in the game than the jets reconquered the ball and Jay Feely changed one 20 yard shot to the 34 to 0 leadership. 
Those ones were the most points the jets ever in a quarter had achieved. 
when he was asked for describing the madness Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets "The second quarter or the third quarter", answered? " 
Onto the answer to both, because the jets approved 21 points in the third quarter without achieving an only, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third. 
A lot of points were achieved quickly. "
