` during the 90 minutes of the debate John McCain had to say a lot of things about me, however nothing about you ', Obama denounced yesterday before 20.000 people that had met on the occasion of an electoral meeting in Nord-Carolina in flowing rain. 
He did not mention not even the words ` middle class' or ` worker '.' this financial crisis provides Obama that those ones hold for most suitable to save the economy even still on the fringe of the abyss to Americans a clear advantage. 
` this coming week could represent a decisive turning point, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday. 
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the administration Clinton, that one compared ` best economical instincts' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
For the democratic candidate the current one is crises' this final judgment of a eight years bad economic policies, that moved by George Bush and of senator McCain supported is'.
