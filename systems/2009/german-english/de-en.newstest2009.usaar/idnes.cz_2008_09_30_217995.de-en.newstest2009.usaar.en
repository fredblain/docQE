Duel on a knife-edge: MP3 players against mobile phones. 
We advise you during your choice 
While nearly every mobile phone is can play MP3 - files yet not MP3 player can phone. 
Therefore that it is better to be bought only a telephone it looks of course like this. 
For all that there are sufficiently reasons for why one should adopt an independent Player. 
The election completely hangs from the type of use and the demands the future owner. 
Surely one scarcely buys oneself for at home a fabulous expensive phonograph, in order to listen to the newest album of Maxim Turbulenc on that. 
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from qualitative point of view there is not also any objective reason for that. 
If you have LPs with kind of rock, jazz or blues in the shelf, however, you dream probably at least about one like that. 
That also with the music is like this on journeys, therefore with compressed music, simplifies expressed - music in the MP3 format. 
Also here there are price and quality categories. 
For one it is not maybe acceptable to spend eight thousand kronor for a Player, in the same way a Pink - Floyd - fan will presumably scarcely verkraften, however headphones on for twenty crowns the market. 
Two extremes between which there is for every sufficient room. 
The selection is widely diversified. 
Also the lifespan of the batteries is decisive. 
Some good Music Player can play music much more than only, however that, what mobile phones can, they do not get not even in outline. 
No modern equipment is to be used as universally as the telephone is. 
Next to the primary functions, the making a call and that ledges, it can display music and videos, to record both it has a better once, once a worse camera and can navigate maybe also. 
And if one includes still the Smartphons and Kommunikatoren, one has almost a small computer in the pocket. 
It is a minor miracle, because no fridge can grill and not to photograph no television. 
But the universality of mobile phones brings also disadvantages with themselves. 
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more frequently you will have to re-load it, however. 
And that of music is one of the largest everything. 
Only a few phones can music longer when ten - to play twelve hours, mostly it is much less. 
In this respect are to music player (specifically the simplest) clearly stronger. 
Therefore you should reckon near cheap mobile phones their not being able to play music longer as a few hours. 
If you phone then now and then still, you buy a loader more with pleasure still for the safety for office - that is valid also for more expensive equipment. 
At MP3 players you will not have this problem, to hold also that one less good at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with a time To Load from. 
Another problem exists then if one wants to re-record the music onto on mobile phone. 
Unfortunately only a small part of the equipment has a USB - end, in addition every mobile phone without special software can not be connected directly to a PC. 
Of course one can re-record the music directly onto a storage medium, nevertheless only few reading equipment card becomes without reduction with the tiny memory cards ready, that are used in mobile phones. 
At players you do not need no special software apart from exceptions (iPod). 
You need to feed the device with music only above USB - port from your PC. 
Most mobile phones and Player create even a music library, arranged according to the name of the performers, the title of the album, the pointed or for example the assessment by users. 
Some devices show only the tree network of the symbolic address table, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, cowons, intelligent telephones with operating system). 
Player are easier to help oneself mobile phones can more 
You should ask the selection of a specific appliance in particular about the service life of the accumulator, storage capacity, the quality and the model of the sound and of course also the operating convenience. 
If particularly backdrop is music for you and if you hear it every day only briefly for example in the trams, an arbitrary Handy which plays MP3 - files suffices then. 
What real almost every mobile phone can. 
You do not have to control either particularly which music formats a mobile phone or a Player can process. 
MP3 create all of them, and most music which you get will be just in this format. 
The format appertains to the most spread, and in addition the majority equipment can play also music in the WMA - format. 
AAC is less usual (to use (a format, that Apple and his iPods). 
Better mobile phones facilitate also the purchase of music in an online way. 
One needs to call the corresponding pages of a Providers (or any other provider) only about mobile Internet, and already one can gain a song or album. 
This service can be already at and for itself a beating argument for why one should adopt a Musikhandy. 
Unfortunately this supply of providers is bad and is restricted mostly only to fast broadcast hits. 
The prices are not the lowest either. 
Generally, however, one assumes just this kind of the sale of music (it is over GSM, Internet or radio-controlled Internet) in future dominating the music industry. 
Most bear the mobile phone with themselves. 
if you have inclination to listen to something, you grasp the mobile phone in the pocket while to forget is suiting to the Player at home. 
It depends, however, on whether you ever bear headphones or at least a radio-controlled hands-free equipment with yourself. 
Otherwise, you can access to the integrated loudspeaker that almost every mobile phone has, however only the least MP3 players. 
The presumably greatest advantage of the Musikhandys will lie for many in the price. 
The cheapest taste normally less than three thousand kronor. 
for three - and you already get four thousand kronor a very decent Walkman. 
The biggest handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are. 
The best and technically advanced telephones with a for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand kronor. 
The advantage of the player lies in turn in the slight serving. 
The simplest - and not absolutely cheapest (see selection) - everyone can help itself Player real. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity during the serving with that formerly normal cassette recorder or for example the phonograph is obvious. 
It no collision in the form of an erroneously done mobile Internets and one threatens then horrendous bill for data transfers. 
the device should one grasp now 
The cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) have normally a slot for exchangeable storage medium (Model M2, microSD and similar things. 
Even if you buy a proper card two thousand kronor suffice. 
However, respect. 
Only cards with a maximum capacity are normally supported in the basis models by 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive can read also 8 - GB memory cards. 
If you own have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap mp3 player, you catch Emgeton then after cowons, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, or iriver. 
According to capacity (maximally. 2 GB) you must put then not more than 1100 crowns onto the table. 
You belong to more demanding listeners, you take more with pleasure specialized Handys - Walkman (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These machines have independent control knobs for MP3, and the operating convenience comes so onto that of an individual MP3-Players here. 
Sony Ericsson, whose Handys have the same user api from the series Walkman as the separately sold MP3-Player, is widest here. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kronor, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long accumulator life (usually 15 hours, a maximum up to 35 hours) MP3 player of the above manufacturers achieve to you.
