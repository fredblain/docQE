Yesterday, during his presence on the festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner added, that the project, with which it occupied 'one daring' is and 'all points on that, that it the novel not write must'.

The hispanoamerikanische new writer granted, that it 'no way and manner' add, to measure at which one and from where one can know whether books change the life ', but I refuses me to believe in that, that the literature pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience is', said Vargas Llosa, who claims, that sie 'securities cause' and 'this people still more auseinander bringt', therefore I asked the writer 'the lightness not left' and 'this responsibility' for his appointment 'take over'.
