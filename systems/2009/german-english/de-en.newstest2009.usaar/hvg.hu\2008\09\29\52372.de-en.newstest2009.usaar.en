What became produces into the accounting factory of acceptance of a bid & amp; 
Co.? On 8th October surcharge and his accomplices begin the negotiations in criminal proceedings against jános. 
In particular the participation in the organized criminality is reproached the defendants, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts - among other things document forgery. 
According to public prosecutor's office the means lukrierten from the bidding were used for their own purposes while the produced services were often being reserved with forged bills. 
State money and grants from the self-government - in total HOOF 65 million - should in part into the cash boxes of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, to have flowed in part into the private funds individual. 
As the investigation announced fictitious invoices were presented while referring the announcement money, and the clubs are not supposed to have fulfilled its obligations either. 
According to indictment a large part of the bills is supposed to have been forged. 
The accounting blocks were bought at on the market by Józsefváros, one made the to change the seals in Kiskunhalas be made. 
The decision on onto what companies the bills are supposed to be exhibited was decided on that round trip north of Lake Balaton onto which István Lados was sent to contract by János. 
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should make pensions and restaurants ausfindig. 
It demanded bills over the Konsumationen, around later on these proposals being based bills for the youth and sport department the social and employment, as well as to be able to exhibit the autonomy of Budapest. 
These bills are supposed to have been manipulated mainly of István Lados and his accomplices András ri at what latter according to our information for the Constitution of the relevant reports responsible is supposed to have been. 
One of the destinations of Lados' "exploration tour" were a beer bar. 
how it is to understand two of acceptance of a bid and Co in 2003 from exhibited bills, if the catering company is supposed to have served the neunzigköpfige group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
Now the head of the business declares, however, a such large group would not have fit at the same time into the local. 
Another bill, exhibited in the summer 2002 onto the donation Jobb Joevért, later known than Egyuett a Harmadik Évezredért, showed also serious form and contents mistakes. 
In a retirement in Badacsonytomaj which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people simultaneously 130 guests are supposed to have stayed according to bill. 
The fantasy of the accounting counterfeiters apparently in the same way no boundaries were set, than it around the Pigal Kft. went, a gastronomy company, in whose accountancy documents of the customers Jobb Joevért and Hoppá not to appear according to Public Prosecution Service at all first. 
As Geschäftsführer informed Gyz Farkas of the hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that it was a question of forged documents when documents were presented to him by the prosecutor's office during a consultation. 
"we company name and was the tax number wrongly on the stamp angebracht". 
And wider: Apart from irregularities also the fact that the operation is supposed to have accommodated a hundred people was wrong after they have in total eleven rooms which offer so many people place impossibly. 
Also Meals was mentioned on the bill, more is not the restaurant in operation in this case since some time. 
The busy accounting counterfeiters checked also verabsäumt, that the Budapester travel agency taken into the visor by them excluding travel abroad offers, and so they gave hungarian trips what of the accounting practices of the company also contradicted on the cash payment bill. 
how in the course of the investigation became known, they in addition mentioned also the VAT on the bills, although travel agency services that refer to a country outside of the EU are value added tax free. 
The level of VAT was in total on four of the hotel Révfueloep Kft. bills exhibited onto the donation Jobb Joevért wrong, there the company instead of 25 only 15 per cent VAT. settles, in addition mechanical bills are exhibited by the staff exclusively, the forged documents were, however, hand - written. 
Another error, that was this "Rechnungslegern" unterlaufen, that one was, that they had indicated in one Fall "shipment" as produced service although this is not offered by the company specialized on investment consultation the prosecutor informed. 
Further irregularities - wrong bill format, wrong die - were to be owed to, that at Egyuett a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as at XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont exhibited bills as counterfeiting could be unmasked. 
In the same way in the case of the Ravenna Bt. and the sport camp Kunfehértó, which managers declared to never have exhibited the bills. 
Another "mistake" is to the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. circumvented from Nyíregyháza: This society was at the time (2001) just indeed in solution when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület is supposed to have eaten there - consequently the mass manager declared not to have exhibited the bills himself. 
Consciously forged 
The other group of the Rechnungsleger are persons who were absolutely conscious that they would have to lay fictitious invoices. 
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták has the donation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the Egyuett a Harmadik Évezredért donation, in a level of about HOOF 4 million. exhibited. 
According to indictment the business manager became the Collab Kft. persuaded to the exhibition the fictitious invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gyoerfi. 
The currently also in liquidation contained Biogate Kft. should also with acceptance of a bid and company. having cooperated: in 2003 should the GmbH the donation Jobb Joevért Alapítvány, as well as the associations of Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny Egyesület with forged bills in the total value of HOOF of 5 million. have supplied, that referred to not produced services. 
There were, however, just as little money transfers since the bills were canceled immediately to their exhibition, which the concerned persons forgot in your documents, however, to note down. 
The third group of the Rechnungsleger contains persons who are brought immediately with the defendants associated. 
Iván Kubatov is to one of them, the mailman of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trió Kft., a resident in Budapest, there, however, not discoverable fuel and vehicle market company. 
This company should in the period of October until December 2005 several bills about the sale of EDV components in the total value of HOOF of approximately 18 million. have exhibited. 
According to investigative body should the Cash Investment Kft contained since the 14th September 2005 in liquidation. having acted as a customer of these accounts from Kiskunhalas. 
Manager of that company was a Romanian to whom the company documents should be delivered also by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information Kubatov stood during the investigation, bills on behalf of the GmbH. onto the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to have issued at Egyuett a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalent itself. 
The Skilled Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos - investment Bt. are supposed to have been based by Romanian Bricklayers on Iván Kubatovs explicit wish there. 
In truth, however, none of these companies was acting, which was due according to accused to lack of contracts. 
Nevertheless he could profit by the company: At the request of his accomplice, the attorney Zsolt Szente that was charged the preparation of the company foundation documents he issued on behalf of the Skilled bills onto the associations brought with contract in, as about at Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
In total should Kubatov 15 bills in the total value of HOOF of 14,2 Mio. on behalf of the firms Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, to have exhibited Jos investment and Linaxtrade onto the organisations. 
The prosecutor assumes that Kubatov could have collected each 10% of the financial sum as well as the VAT. 
Kubatov should even the company Szi-Beri Bt. to have misused for the exhibition imaginary bills - in this case the accounts were enclosed with the applications by Biztos Pont. 
The company Y-Generáció and Szoevetség a Rot Magyarországért to have in January 2006 their applications with the not-for-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA") given. 
Both ever received 500.000 forints, these amounts however, were useful, however, zweckentfremdet. 
In order to hush this up, they have the TMA five ostensible bills of the Works Team Kft. 
presented. These bills were guaranteed after all by Árpád Kemecsei during the raid on the offices in the instruction department. 
At the negotiations a confession is reckoned now by some defendants about the procedure of the counterfeit banknotes as they were already before the public prosecutor's office put aside. 
A sensation could be, if the main defendants János contract to a full confession decides. 
His previous data were less indeed detailed, and although he had promised already repeatedly to tell comprehensively above all, still stands his confession. 
The question whether this lies in its interests remains therefore open the socialists a pact with it concerning the reparation of the majority of the arisen damage of HOOF of 50 million. have closed, and whether it is ready to Zuschlag to take over the responsibility in return. 
It is, however, absolutely possible, that acceptance of a bid now this "Beleidigten" play, after his requests had bumped on ease the imprisonment and house arrest on fallen on deaf ears. 
during other criminals that caused far greater damage with economic crime and did not compensate far greater damage, on free foot, or to stand at least under house arrest, remains to surcharge this possibility refuses.
