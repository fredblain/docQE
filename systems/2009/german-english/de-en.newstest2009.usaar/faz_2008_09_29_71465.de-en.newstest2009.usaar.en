Sleepless nights for believers of the Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück stressed first in that one lasted week. 
How good, that the politicians the word "relative" use and also still inserted, that the German banking sector of the troubled developments is not spared to. 
Because that one kicked in at the weekend now. 
The inhabitant of Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) noted down in the Dax receives a billions of credit from a consortium of German banks in order to shield oneself from the turbulence at the markets. 
A with the situation familiar person, said Reuters on Monday, the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros. 
The Hypo Real Estate must pay only on the part which it also uses interest. 
The money comes both of private and public banks. 
Losses are background with the daughter Depfa. 
The Staatsfinanzierer had refinanced itself extremely for a short period of time according to a newspaper report for long period of time projects for which it lent money - what meanwhile because of the suspicion at the markets more is not possible. 
In the first half of 2008 the cash reserve of the bank had shrunk to 95 per cent on 2,37 million euro, also the equity had given easily from 1,6 on 1,45 percent. 
The running profits and net revenue deriving from financial transactions had fallen opposite the period last year onto zero, the proceeds sunk from ascription to demands and certain securities as well as from the dissolution from accrued liabilities in the credit business around more than 70 per cent on 5 million euros. 
Only thanks to higher profits from payments of subordinate settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as from the payment of interests according to the tax and from the business errand for Associated Companies, the profit minus with about 16 percent had made drop out still moderat. 
The formerly Staatsfinanzierer had after his privatisation in 1990 at first with commercial borrowing capabilities verspekuliert, that then in the Aareal Bank ausgegliedert were. 
Because one earned too little in the classical state financing, the Depfa had intensified then in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint efforts of private investors and the state engages (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. 
Onto the value of the daughter the Hypo Real Estate must carry out now writing-off that will have an "essential physical effect" on the typical of the group be called it quite indefinitely. 
The fact is that the dividend was deleted. 
Already for 2007 it had been abbreviated around two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate is since the Depfa incorporation an important State - and Infrastrukturfinanzierer. 
It is stronger than other institutes of the refinance at the interbank market dependent, since she does not have any customer deposits. 
With the breakdown of the American investment bank of Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the lending versiegt among banks again to a large extent since the banks hoard their solvency. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually short-term funds to refinancing for a part - about 50 billion euros - of the Kreditportfolios of the Depfa. 
After communication of the Hypo Real Estate, the need for the group is covered with the credit onto the foreseeable future and that enterprise "of the influence of the currently to a large extent inoperative international ones money market" screen. 
From other sources it is to be heard that thanks to the money the refinance is safeguarded until end of 2009. 
The HRE executive board chairperson Georg Funke declared, on the other hand that the Hypo Real Estate Group more will not have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future. 
Bundesbank and the Federal Institution for financial service supervision (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Gruppe is now safeguarded. 
That is entitled to for shareholders and creditors of the bank hope. 
But faced with the dynamism and Unwägbarkeiten of the crisis there is not is no certainty. 
It is not even unconceivable that the funding does not have to be used in full extent. 
But also the opposite is not to be split off. 
After at on Late Sunday evening according to the hearing the bank still stood before the bankruptcy also at least temporary rescue is able not to calm the feelings. 
The share price starts by 75% on 3,30 euro. 
On the other hand quite well the lending transactions hold themselves. 
The priority debts do not last in a hardly in motion way show, the courses of the Nachrang-Anleihen drop more clearly. 
Particularly the loans of the former subsidiary company Württemberg Hypo and understandably the more than 2009 exceeding terms are affected. 
If hypo-real - Estate - loans seem a speculative annex alternative formerly whose stipulating must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system so after the clear sharpening of the banking crisis and the institute itself which with the incorporation of the Depfa the crisis had gotten to itself first into the house. 
For so long the central banks, governments and less hit commercial bank for to support the system still ready are, for so long a proud eradication of pensions can be gone out of. 
Or however it what somebody currently hardly yet dares to hope comes - that the financial crisis is overcome in the next 15 months. 
However faced with the announcements somersaulting with the partial nationalisation only an entitled hope currently became from the probability verging on security. 
That might prepare some sleepless nights with the decision whether they are supposed to separate from their commitment particularly for long-term believers. 
Short-term investors can use a draw line after all for that a loss presentation for the future settlement tax payments onto course profits of later years form.
