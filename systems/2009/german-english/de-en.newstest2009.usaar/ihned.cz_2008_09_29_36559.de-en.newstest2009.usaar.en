The law but, will undergo some changes. 
The total amount determined to To help for the system is supposed to be divided into two parts. 
The initial 350 billion dollars are supposed to be set as quickly as possibly readily as president George Bush required. 
The congress can block, however, the filling of the remaining money if he has the impression that the programme does not fulfill his function and indeed at further 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
