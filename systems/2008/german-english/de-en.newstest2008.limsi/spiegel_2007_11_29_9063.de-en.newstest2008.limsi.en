Venus is zwilling the Earth a hellish 
Venus, despite their lebensfeindlichen is the Earth's atmosphere than previously thought, the European spacecraft went "Venus Express" lightning in the atmosphere and Windwirbel in Poland, as winter on the earth. 
For nearly three decades, scientists suspect that it blitzt on Venus. 
Now, the European probe "Venus Express" proven - they sensed electromagnetic waves on the fringes of the atmosphere at: the lightning on Venus shooting at a rate of about 56 miles from cloud to cloud, Christopher Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles in the journal " nature. " 
According to the famous "Ursuppen-Theorie" lightning life on Earth: storm give rise to reactions in the ocean have suggested the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life. 
Not so at Venus: "If ever there was live there, it must have been very early history," said Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington. 
Now it seems on the surface of Venus barely alive: the atmosphere, around one hundred times denser than on the ground, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees. 
"Venus is perhaps the Teufelszwilling of the earth, but it is a zwilling," said Russell. 
Why the Venus, the earth in mass and size similar, such an entirely different development has taken is Esa-Mission of the issue. 
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus-Forschung, since the beginning of the 1990s no probe more specifically to study the planet was away. 
The latest research, now entering a number of "-Artikeln" nature will stress, according to the researchers are not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system. 
"They also show that the Nachbarplaneten of common ground with the earth are bigger than first thought," shares the ESA. 
For example, the researchers in addition to the already well-known on North Pole whirlwind Wolkenstrudel on a Südpol, which is still significantly faster. 
) The phenomenon is reminiscent of luftströme Winterhemisphäre on the abasing worldly, wrote in a research team headed by the Italian Piccioni Giuseppe Di Astrofisica Spaziale process of Cosmica Fisica e.. 
The zweitinnerste planet of the solar system was almost exactly the same as the Earth and is in diameter 12.100 kilometres almost as great. 
Morgen- also called Abendstern or called planet revolving around 225 days, just under the sun. 
He turns but much slower themselves Venustag: a Erdentage 243 lasts. 
Although the Venus with sea-surface temperatures of 460 degrees and a pressure from 92 bar hardly reminiscent of the Earth, researchers claim that both planet under similar conditions. 
On both there has been a water on the Earth was in oceans, Venus but in space. 
And while carbon dioxide at the Earth at Karbonatgesteinen, power is fixated on Venus the bulk of the atmosphere.
