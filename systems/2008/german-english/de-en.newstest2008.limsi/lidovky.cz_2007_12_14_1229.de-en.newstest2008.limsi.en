Klaus: debates the ecologists is quite incredible 
Global climate change damage allegedly developing countries most. 
President Vaclav Klaus' return to the issue of global warming. 
The criticism was now on the drawing to the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali. 
In Vienna, where his book "a blue, not a green planet" that he tells us that the debates of the ecologists quite incredible. 
Klaus, not just the structure of the conference unacceptable, a strange mixture of public officials and by non-governmental organizations, misunderstood, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompany them, and the reality. 
"The debate unstrukturiert is there, it is a Wortfeuerwerk that only a substitute for a real solution to the current problems," said Klaus. 
The Czech president said at the launch of his book that the issue is very important to him and that is so committed. 
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book in the German translation of credentials, because "I often on caricatures of my views." 
Now that interested parties could read, and undistorted. 
Klaus recalled that he had not klimatologe, but he said that in his view, adequate conditions for such a book to write. 
He was finally academics, capable, professional pamphlets to understand and to judge have experience with statistics and economist, too. 
The main thrust of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing, and that his changes therefore quite natural that it on global warming is not being the consensus among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes not too big and seriously and thus are not a threat, and that the efforts, the development of climate, useless, ineffective and unacceptable expensive. 
Additionally, he is someone with the experience with Sytemen totalitarian, unacceptable, other unproven views on it, see it as a dangerous restriction of freedom. 
Answering questions from here, he said repeatedly that he was not against "a sound environment, but against Ã¶ko-aktivisten militants who do not take account of the relationship between effort and reward." 
On the same issue Klaus in Vienna had been two months ago - in the Hayek-Institut.
