England faced with a decision on Owais by Bopara and Ravi Shah 
Two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other. 
Who is supposed to be number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Bopara Shah or Ravi? 
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision? 
The second question is important because, Graveney David, Wahlvorsitzende, to call at least at this particular title, is Cheftrainer, Peter Moore's and captain Michael Vaughan and help to decide, and because the table of Morries high, the English managing director with applications to slowly for national Wählerämter fills, if not for what in part-time. 
Whoever the sixth Schlägerposition not, will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport, it is certainly. 
It is never easy, just want a person, which allows for the top of its berufszweiges, and somebody else never hinauskommt the lowest rank, sometimes because of a lack of good fortune rather than ability. 
It is not only in cricket, where the choice is difficult, where decisions are needed, which are at the end of subjective. 
It is the right time for Bopara levels? 
Is it fair to Shah if it does? 
The same can perhaps in another area to be asked whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good qualifications, the business familiar, should be promoted. 
Who can say what the right class for a cricketers, unless he has the opportunity to be submerged or swim. 
Of course, pay a great influence on decisions, but prospects of it. 
Within a team needs a cricketers master's eye at the right time, if he can take a Wicket and a bat, regular opportunities in order when he, as a one-day cricketers impression. 
The eyes of the Auswähler to catch is more complicated. 
There were many who last season better than, for example, when James Anderson, who appears to play in the first test, even if Harmison Stephen themselves as healthy and as the wind in the nets kegelt. 
Anderson took Wickets 32 first-class with 33 Runs a position on this tour. 
Chris Tremlett, only 29 with the same modest average, but both had its high points and hope for more. 
Whether Bopara Shah or Asgiriya stage plays in, can only be a Ansichtsfrage. 
The election could the careers of both men, or it might make little difference. 
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs, however, it was Paul Collingwood at kämpfend to consolidate the breakthrough to a major Testkricketspieler expeditions and even though he was a double hundred against Australia in punktete Australia, perhaps still undervalued. 
Probably that Graveney is, Vaughan and Moore's, after a further discussion within Netzsitzung of Asgiriya today in stage its conservative instincts and bauchgefühl Shahs for greater experience of Boparas youthful enthusiasm will follow. 
There are arguments for both. 
For funkelnden Shah says his Test-Debüt-Innings and valuable 88 in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds, and only six of the Bopara, with 22 years is seven years younger, and their angedrehtes record against bullets. 
But Shah only 10 Runs in his two Innings in May against West Indies on the test in Lord, its Heimatarena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus its immediate rejection of the Auswählern as Vaughan healthy was his position for the next game seems to reverse the momentum from his proposal, which was obviously in Mumbai. 
By contrast, the Alleskönner schaufelweise appetite for Essex. 
He is nothing Kricketplatz impressed on a remote and its attitude, it was to come to the point, when he recently Vierradantrieb a car with an exhibition for England sponsor Volkswagen in rapid succession. 
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was his Vodafone gesponsort (of course), Teamkollegen; and his to Alastair Cook who watched from afar and enthusiasm to say: " Have you seen this? '. 
Bopara is Feldspieler a much better kegelt, Mitteltempo be here with some effect on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and proposes with confidence and skill. 
The right man to vote is one thing, the right moment to select a different. 
Perhaps this is the real art of choice. 
I would be inclined Bopara now his chance, which does not Mean that Shah may not be doing well, if, as the Teesatz from Sri Lanka to suggest that he is here this weekend.
