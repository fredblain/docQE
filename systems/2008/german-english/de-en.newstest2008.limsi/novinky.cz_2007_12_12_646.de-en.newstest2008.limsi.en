Peugeot 207 test VTi SW 1.6 Voruteile are: 
To tell the truth, I was never a big fan of the Peugeot 206. 
His Fahreigenschaften were not much value, the quality of today, the management and the processing, you could describe as somewhat below average. 
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207 in the market, which is so much better. 
The Kombi called SW is still a bit, and it only remains for me to change my mind. 
When I Hatchback the classic the 207 had tested, I have had to, for example, through Kopffreiheit low Hintersitzen to complain. 
These complaints, there is now no longer because of the Kombi if the is such that Zweimetermänner are not. 
Soon further 
The interior decorating, I am only briefly in order not to repeat. 
It is a very successful design, where I try to just because of the Mitteltunnels reservations. 
Here, a little more designerische building, where the car would be an so elegant impression. 
The seat is convenient, and gone are the times where we may be about to brief seats and head restraints, complaining. 
The Seitenhalt has 206 improved considerably. 
With regard to the space is concerned, we can make the enlarged dimensions. 
The Kombi is also the mentioned lack of Kopffreiheit. 
Trunk in the boot 
The main thing in this car, however, is thrown into ships' holds. 
The I need (for aufklappbaren Rückfensters), beladbar than very good and platzsparend. 
The hohlräume Haltegurten equipped with a perfect compromise. 
You are not auseinanderziehen, and even heavier objects. 
But do we know about the ladevolumen. 
It is under the table in the basic structure of 428 litre, as compared to the competition a rather ordinary is worth. 
But not in comparison with the Czech Republic top-selling vehicle this category of Fabia, the Škoda Combi. 
If we have the 207 SW with the new generation of products from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the Peugeot clear signs of 52 litres. 
For Auslandsurlaub or a Kinderwagens loading, this value is already critical. 
The Positiva, however, I have yet to Umklappen the following the rücksitze of very shallow thrown into ships' holds or even the very low Ladekante. 
120 PS in four rows 
Our Testwagen with a Vierzylinder-Benzinmotor was with cubic capacity 1.6 litre and a performance by 88 KW. 
And, quite frankly, 1600-Kubik-Motor should be Familien-Hatchback, one. 
He is quiet, has a low consumption and prefers leash. 
When I saw him with his Škoda counterpart to compare the sometimes seems as though his auspuff with a rag blocked, then I can only be impressed. 
The price list written speaks volumes 
The price of this car is not exactly volkstümlich. 
But we must remember that we are a well-funded car Innneren with a geräumigen and a very good engine have tested. 
The basic price of cars with the 1400er putting amounting to 329900 kroner is still on. 
With this engine is the cost of 410900 kroner from what is quite a lot. 
The Testwagens proposes Premium of again with 80000 an extra Sweden kronors annually. 
We had, however, Kopfairbags automatic air conditioning, Scheibenwischerauslösung, mechanical, electrical fensterheber and back and... 
So that costs a total 531900 cars less kronor. 
That is a lot, but expect the increase they once a Fabia together and they are in a very similar sum. 
Then the decision, which brand to be chosen.
