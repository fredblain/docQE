The season are not widely holidays 
In Hungary are holidays carefully regulated by law, so that the practice of Umdisponierens the days around the holiday season has become established, but brings in the coming year less such days. 
Also in the EU and in America, you understand, "Holiday." 
Hungarian Justice distinguishes between Staatsfeiertagen and why days. 
Arbeitsfreie days are mostly religious holidays, or with important historical events in context. 
We are celebrating the New Year holidays: both the last day of the old, as well as the first day of the New Year Arbeitsfreie are days - the latter alone Silvester-Feiernden to rest. 
Throughout the year, we have a total of 14 holidays. 
The Staatsfeiertage are the 15 march to the revolution of 1848, and reminiscent of 23 October, the day of the Revolution of 1956. 
On 20 August is the formation of a state, on May 1, celebrated the work on 1 and 2 November we remember our dead. 
In addition, there are two breaks, pfingsten at Easter and Christmas. 
Since our heads of state, national or religious holidays rarely on a weekend, has the practice of "Arbeitstags-Verschiebung" in some cases, in which we before or after the holiday just a day would work. 
The price of extended weekends, however, that we samstagen from the very well working or in school. 
When the day before or after the holiday, ultimately will be dealt with, for long years of labour in a specific regulation. 
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, for public employees and officials of public service. 
Here are only exempted firms and institutions in which the company without interruption, which includes the holidays. 
This year, the working order only by the festive season slightly confused: 24 December remains formally life here, since most of the days between Zeitausgleich Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the special suspended vacations. 
Next year more days' holiday in the Wochenmitte, or at the end of the week, so that the Umdisponierungen working days will be less than this year. 
The calendar will first around the Labor Day "on its head," so that the people just four days in a row can stay at home. 
Saturday, April 26, will be a day for the Friday, 2 may be a day of rest. 
The second umdisponierung is connected with the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday 18 October will Friday 24 October completion in advance. 
At the end of the year, however, is completely under the sign of the holiday season, after starting on the 24th December and remains, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
