These are not Warhols boxes 
Who the concepts of Sweden and Holzkiste, thinks of Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol. 
Or is it? 
Now throw Holzkisten them, manufactured in Sweden Warhols dark shadow over Werkverzeichnis. 
A large part of the vierundneunzig Brillo-Boxen listed in the "type of Stockholm" are forgeries. 
Once the Swedish newspaper 'Expressen', a few months ago, questioned the Warhols authenticity of Andy Brillo-Boxen of the Year in 1968, stirred up Moderna internal investigations in Museet in Stockholm now to a sobering result: the six Brillo-Boxes "' that former Museumsdirektor Pontus Moderna Museet Hulthén's that put vermacht in 1995 and are copies - and I think the majority of Brillo-Boxen around one hundred others from the" type of Stockholm, " on the international art market. 
The verschachtelt is a puzzling string kuratorischer artistic and production. 
1964 Warhol created in New York, his first Brillo-Boxes "Holzkisten," bemalte, rot-blau-weißen at the design of Seifenpulvers cardboard boxes of " Brillo ". 
An exhibition of Moderna his work on Museet 1968 was Warhols - with the agreement, hundreds of Brillo-Kisten from cardboard: these were (spurned by Warhol) but were directly from the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik holidays. 
It is not works of art, but their role models merely exhibits. 
At the same time Warhol 1968 has probably given permission to a few Brillo-Holzkisten in Sweden to produce, although not issued Moderna Museet. 
Eye witnesses are now talking about 15 boxes, then the Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes as authorized by the name of the 'type of Stockholm' right to Auktionsgeschichte and the arts. 
Some of them have at auction more than 100 000 dollars. 
The problem is that Museumsdirektor the legendary Pontus Hulthén's misrepresented later said that there are around one hundred Holzkisten 1968 in Sweden produced and issued the Warhol, leaving him then. 
Indeed, Hulténs 105 cases in Malmö until 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg. 
At that point, Warhol was already three years dead. 
Lars Byström Chefkonservator Moderna, Museet Saturday, has museumseigenen the six Brillo-Boxes, three from the Swedish privatised, two of whom 1968 produced in Stockholm: their Pressspanplatten grundiert and were abgeschmirgelt, then ölfarbe with a white had brushes. 
The structure of the copies from 1990, however, suggests that the colour Malerrolle without a Grundierung directly to the Pressspanplatte imposing - also is not oil, but Acrylfarbe. 
"These boxes were not authorised by the artist and best of the official list Warhols Brillo-Boxes by Andy removed", Moderna director of Museet, Lars Nittve, said: 'if' the Andy Warhol kind of Authentication board ' in New York to a different conclusion is Moderna, Museet will be the six boxes in his collection Ausstellungsmaterial as copies / classified. " 
Back in July, however, has the Authentication board announced that the "serious accusations", the Seifenpulver-Kisten in terms of the collected. 
But since then, it remains unerbittliches in silence.
