Political capital: Staatsrisiko increased Hungarian GUARD 
According to the Department for Risk Analysis (risk Analysing division) of political capital, the activities of this August, with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary " formed Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and of the region in several respects. 
In the "Risikowarnungs-Bericht" of the institute says, among other things, that, in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard, the highest political risk, " the tightening of existing ethnic tensions between Gypsy and Nicht-Zigeunerbevölkerung in Hungary, even in the short term to violent ethnic clashes could lead. " 
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, which probably at the provocation of this conflict, such as the one. 
As has been reported, this will be a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People seen in public life, the discussion of the Roma issue representatives of radical political groups, which now has its political strategy on the Roma-Ungarn-Gegensatz have built." 
It is believed that this is the problem, the sensible dialogue impossible, injuries, and the likelihood of violent clashes would increase. 
The Forschungsinsitut ausserdem believes the activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary abroad substantial damage, particularly in terms of confidence in the stability and democratic maturity is concerned." 
We remember that since the autumn of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary steadily on the rise, so since the summer of 2007, "Selbstverteidigungsverein" national organisations were set ablaze. 
"These groups share the common characteristic of each define a civil organisation, while you open going to claim that its members - sometimes prepare armed - defence tasks (civil defence, defence, Ordnungshütung), invoking the ineffectiveness of the police, the Army, or the state itself," it said. 
It continues: all of this is in accordance with the method tried, several of Parteiverdrossenheit policies and the peoples' political aspirations as civil initiative to disguise. 
The emphasis on the civilian character and Vereinsform are not merely the circumvention of legal hurdles in the process of registration could appear in court - it is also a political strategy. 
As the analysis suggested that the activities of risikoerhöhenden Hungarian guard a factor for relations with neighbouring states. 
" In recent months, the Hungarian guard in several of its neighbours as a potential source quoted some ultranationalistischer politicians of certain neighbouring sees the emergence of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own Anti-Ungarn-Politik. 
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region, " it said. 
From the point of view of the institute is the creation of the Hungarian guard Zentral-Ost-Europa no entry in, so the political risk for the entire region. 
As has been reported that the activities of the Hungarian guard with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose founding in August 2007 from the extreme right-wing Bulgaria BNU National Union (). 
In the light of the emergence of Bulgarian guard Roma-Massenausschreitungen were in a built-up areas of Krasna Poljana (Sofia). 
The BNU has the facts straight to the source of the founding of the National Guard, with the argument that the aim of the Organization of the "national protection." 
In their view, was in the past 17 years Zigeunerterror a veritable "significantly" in Bulgaria, the government has, however, remained inactive and indifferent, as political capital. 
And further: the initiative had a heated debate in the Bulgarian public opened up. 
As I said, the increased risk for ethnic conflict is also shown by the fact that some Roma-Organisationen of Bulgaria announced Widerstandszwecken to their own guards. 
Since the activities of the Hungarian guard many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, shows, it is not impossible that the Hungarian Roma with whom to organize their own protection, on the threats, according to the Risikowarnungsbericht of political capital. 
Forschungsdirektor Attila Juhász, said in political capital on question of the nachrichtenbüros: the analysis is one of the activities of the Forschungsinstitutes. 
Risikoanalyseberichte would be published annually, and if risikoverändernden tendencies will be public opinion informed, as in the case by the publication of the Risikowarnberichtes.
