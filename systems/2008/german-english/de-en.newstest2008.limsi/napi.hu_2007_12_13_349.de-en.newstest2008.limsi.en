Auchan most expensive, Tesco has increased by nearly one-fifth 
The Budaörser Handelsgebiet Hypermarkets in this year, the average increase of 16 percent from last year, with the difference that there was this year no increase in the value-added tax. 
Gazdaság Napi article from 
The Budaörser Handelsdreieck did the price of a traditional Weihnachtskorbes Napi " ' this year increased by 16 percent, but it Hypermärkten in all price increases over 1000 HUF recorded. 
After prices in the lebensmittelmärkten last December davongaloppiert " the prozentuell rise not drastic, compared with the already high, former initial level. 
However, it is the consumers certainly deterrent that what he last year HUF far below 9,000 had paid this year 10,000 to HUF. 
The price of Warenkorbs Napi " ' the Magic 10.000-HUF-Grenze crossed HUF at least 91 in the subjects of the markets. 
The highest 10.573 HUF price fraud. 
(In 6800, the 6.800 price in HUF) 
Prices for Unicum and vibrant fish Vorjahresniveau remained practically, have grown sharply, however, are the prices of Putenbrustfilets and poppy, testament. 
Prices of flour and bread with the data from the Central Statistics Office of Hungary, Auchan by 1kg, however, there has been Brotwecken for 139 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into. 
There was the product of a competitive drop to below 200 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into. 
Equally surprising was here, the price of a Pfandflasche two litres of Coca-Cola below 200 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into claimed, so the drink, including HUF only 257 deposits. 
However, this year's average Napi in "Warenkorbs-Vergleich Auchan" most expensive, and Cora at best. 
Our calculations showed that Cora prices in the "Napi" to the Weihnachtspreisen basket last year to 15, while Auchan Tesco and 18 percent respectively. 
The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive this year's fraud 12 %, whereas the billigstem increase between basket in the past year and teuerstem this year, 21 %. 
The average 1.480,00 HUF boom fraud. 
The average price increase in the previous year was 1.206,00 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into still, however, the VAT hike imposes price last Christmas. 
It is this process has taken the trade predicament: apparently such could not quite decide what preisspanne you in the individual articles should apply, because the consequences of raising prices on consumers incalculable. 
(If the distributor umlaufgeschwindigkeit a product which is bad, it can make significant gains in the preisspanne, Verkehrsintensität that.) 
Mehwertsteuer-bedingt, the Napi rise of the "Warenkorbes" last year so radical that the most expensive basket the value of 1720 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into 2006 crossed to draw, whereas the cheapest basket just 844 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into fraud. 
This year, such extreme not seen as the most expensive 1.630,00 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into a basket for more expensive than last year, and even the cheapest, there was a 1.284,00 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into of price increases. 
Compared with the last two Weihnachtssaisons became a disastrous effect of the increase, the price of homes in the Hypermärkten of them in less than 20 months to more than 30 percent. 
(This, in turn, confirmed the data is not necessarily the Central Statistics Office of Hungary: some basic foodstuffs, the statistics office during the period of 12 months, a more than 30-prozentige high prices. 
So in addition to flour with eggs.) 
But if you look in the "Napi" market basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, because the price level of expensive product last year, even in the worst case, little more than 10 percent rise. 
Mehllieferanten are obviously in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten - it was the drastic increase to the multinationals. 
Happy Handelsdreieck complain aren't the Hypermarkets starting; it is not by the good years. 
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warenhäusern no longer on prices. 
It will especially large quantities, have bought paletten foods are Ladentische about it. 
Wednesday morning, there were in all three warenhäusern epic in the Kassa queues, when suddenly the number of customers exploded. 
However, the country Kundenfrequenz reported a drop, so many Meinungsforschern multinationals to complain that they could not even the planned turnover, not only with food, but also in sustainable consumer products.
