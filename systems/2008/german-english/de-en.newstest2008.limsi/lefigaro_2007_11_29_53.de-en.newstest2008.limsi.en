Spectacular repairs on the space station 
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades of the crew of the International Space Station (eat) more than seven hours in space have taken the spectacular Sonnenkollektors repair of faults, for the continuation of the scientific work on the station is indispensable. 
A risky departure, because of its duration, the bewohnbaren distance of modules, the speed with which he has been organised and the  astronauts who see gebastelten  instruments to carry out repairs has made several records. 
The problem met on Wednesday as the astronauts the module harmony of the Challenger Discovery had pushed, a huge zylinderförmiges part, which will soon be the European and Japanese science laboratories. 
This module is a kind of Landungsbrücke Modul-Labore for the. 
But it must be supplied with electricity. 
The second task of occupation is a 17.5 tons of heavy module electricity through solar panels, which is already on the eat was to implement it in its final position. 
After they had put the crew on the restructuring of moduls solar panels of whose scope 76 metres. 
And it happened that one of the collectors, Akkordeone and auffalten put eingeklemmtes through a Cable to a distance of about one meter was damaged 
The restructuring was stopped Kollektor, no more damage. 
The astronauts originally scheduled for Kontrollgang to leave the challenger Discovery and then Sonnenkollektor another, whose rotating system was flawed should repair forcing damaged in the Kollektor. 
And Scott Parazynski was chosen, at the end of 30 metres ferngesteuerten wing of the Challenger, the station was appropriate to Walk around the repair. 
He is , one of the Spacewalker  best (Wetraumgänger) of NASA. 
Great, resilient, very skillfully, he has a well-developed restricts and long arms. 
The 46-jähirige skilled doctor was therefore  selected  injured in the Sonnenkollektor   to operate. 
The damage after he had just made it severed the faulty Cable and paved the way for the damaged tracks. 
It was produced by  Spacewalker in a second  near the Channel, and from inside by the other astronauts, including Kommandantin Peggy Whitson, the occupation. 
The tool that he used Mini-Hockeyschläger, a umwickelt, with Isolator on the solar panels, which several hundred Volt, produce an electric shock, had to prevent the astronauts aboard the  station up  and procedures. 
As the campaign ended, waited Scott Parazynski, Kollektor until aufgefaltet was completely before he abzählte his tools and the station returned back. 
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts had half a day before today detente seven astronauts on the challenger Discovery returned back, probably Wednesday the return journey to Earth.
