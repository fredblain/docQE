What insurance is for me the best? 
The car insurance, which caused the driver potential disaster, which implies a high cost wiederrum, whose size depends on several factors, including by age, gender, date of the creation of a driving licence, family status, kind of insured cars and use, etc. 
Owning a car is only the beginning. 
Because it is even more difficult to find suitable motor insurance as the right Fahrzeugmodell. 
First of all, a clear, what we are dealing with. 
A take is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholders. 
This agreement is going through a versicherungsvertrags in writing, which specifies that the society versicherungsprämie agreed and ABN obliged with a Abfindungssumme action disaster. 
The versicherungsprämie is the price of insurance, which is made by several factors, including age, gender, date of the creation of a driving licence, family status, kind of insured vehicle or use. 
The insurance companies, their prices, according to the statistics, so to a higher risk of higher contributions are payable. 
For this reason, both about celebrating as well as women less contributions because, statistics show that these groups, thanks to their caution in a minor accident rate. 
The same goes for married people, since these, according to the statistical values and therefore also convinced that companies tend to fewer accidents as single. 
The benefits will be placed on the vehicle, the frequency of the dangers and the likelihood of an accident. 
More common use, the more likely the damage. 
In the preparation of the insurance Premium must a number of points. 
For this reason, the drivers must carefully study the situation to select the take his personal needs most. 
We lists at this point, the main items on which the selection of insurance would have to consider, not just a performance, but also a preisorientierte choice. 
Under the 25-year meeting on the choice of low-cost insurance to many obstacles, such as the  rewarding driving experience and which young  licence. 
Even if it is an ideal insurance would be best, a Vollkaskoversicherung, there are cheaper alternatives. 
The cautious drivers Vollkasko can choose to cover, so the Vollkaskoversicherung machines are covered, but at a low price. 
This type of treaty means that the customer a fraction of the damage caused by the amount even pay. 
For  before the Treaty and on the basis of the versicherungsprämie levels. This is higher the smaller bezahlende amount to , said Luis Noguera, main exponents of Spain in first Vermittlungsunternehmen Europe, a Online-Versicherungen for. 
Another option is the enlarged insurance, the customers against external damage, but not against the car damage incurred. 
Furthermore, this type of insurance theft, fire, and Fahrzeugverlust. 
A council. 
If you are under 25 years old are, it is in your hands, to reduce the cost of insurance; increases your credit advice, by versuchst to drive carefully and accidents. 
A credit advice is a reduction in the basic with the insurance company. 
On the contrary, includes a Strafzahlung to an increase in the tariff. 
 The amount of credits and total penalty depend on the society and its earnings. 
If the company ertragsreiches a year behind us, can afford Bonus-Zahlungen, , to increase Noguera explained. 
Once the 25-Jahre-Marke is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude an agreement. Reason is the fact that with increasing rewarding driving experience the accident rate is falling. 
So it is best to Vollkaskoversicherung for one with excesses. 
 Usually can do not benefit from their experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of the , not as Vorsteher as the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents in the second Praxisjahr occur after the ,  fear of the Anfängers was obtained. 
Nevertheless, it is a married customers, not children possess a Vollkaskoversicherung wiser. But only, of course, if the financial situation of the person in question also allows. 
From the insurers are couples with children as customers with the lowest accident rate, and correspondingly low their contributions come from. 
In this case is Vollkaskoversicherung with a cover (for a sum to 300 euros) the best option. In the case that a high credit advice has been received, is an expanded insurance, the only the third Fahrzeugjahr. 
 They go as a whole should be more relaxed and have more purchasing power, allowing them to pay a larger , Luis Noguera. 
For pensioners, it is Vollkaskoversicherung, one with excesses (for a sum to 150 euros), or an expanded insurance, who got a sufficiently high credit advice. 
Ultimately you have to Bear in mind that the take something very important, not only because they are the drivers against possible damage, but also because of high costs, require that a thorough selection, our personal situation.
