It is widely used to save 
This year, more than a thousand infections in hospitals, which lead to the improper handling of antibiotics were due. 
Sanitary conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding in the beds, congestion of personnel - all factors that the tide of infections are not necessarily favourable, such as the chief of the National Epidemiologiezentrums doctor. 
It is widely used as well. 
Traumatologie-abteilung of the János hospital MRSA-Infektion was recently diagnosed with it. 
The antibiotic-resistant bakterium has found a male patients and, after a serious accident ended up in hospital. 
The patient was isolated. 
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection. 
The injured have been hospitalized because of a serious released from the hospital, not long after the man was MRSA-Infektion with a return was an important operation because of the Bakteriums since then, which is still in the patient's body, not yet. 
To 10 December of this year, 1094 from hospitals were generated by multi-drug resistant virus infections to the National Nosocomialis reported surveillance system, such as the chief of the National Epidemiologiezentrums Doctor Böröcz, Karolina. 
So many people, generated by multi-drug resistant virus infections in hospitals with security, the real figure may be higher. 
About two thirds of (683 infection cases of MRSA), Methicillin-Oxacillin, which triggered Staphylococcus aureus resistant. 
Staphylococcus aureus that bakterium (SA), about a third of the people in front of their noses, without there being a disease. 
Sa-bedingte infections Halsentzündung (such as mandelentzündung, inflammations, the skin and wounds) tend to respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable. 
The resources are, however, too large extent or incorrectly applied, are respondierenden from the good antibiotic-resistant bacteria in appropriate conditions in hospitals quickly spread. 
Especially in patients with geschwächtem, or durable poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight can these bacteria severe infections, Wundinfektion or such as Blutvergiftung, Sepsis, cause. 
The medical director of the János hospital show that the MRSA-Infektion nothing special such incidents are part of the Krankehausalltag. 
We should not infected with the epidemic manhte Tibor confuse Nyulasi - MRSA, there is just not where they are not. 
Resistant to antibiotics 
"Such patients are isolated, nursing staff Gummihandschuhe bears and masks supply, and we have the treatment for necessary antibiotics Tibor", Nyulasi. 
When they arrived at the hospital patients on MRSA, an infection, there is not always to be avoided. 
Sampling too rarely 
The majority of MRSA caused by infections in hospitals would be preventable, but whether the current conditions and circumstances of bad for the control of the emergence or the spread of multiresistenten anthrax Karolina Böröcz says. 
After this infection in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should take the eingelieferten MRSA-infizierte patients immediately investigated and isolated. 
In the Hungarian hospitals will not, however, microbiological being so often practiced. 
Not least because the state health insurance fund no subsidies for this survey. 
Most of the cases that come to light only if the patient MRSA-Infektion a bemerkbare, so medical head of the Epidemiologiezentrums. 
Part of the European Union, there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes. 
Antibiotika-therapien should be targeted, in other words, microbiological tests are necessary so that no resistance to the funds, but will this directive of hospitals are not always respected. 
Among the ambulanten, or in the care of patients microbiological sampling were even more rare, Böröcz Karolina. 
Saved used in the 
Scientific evidence demonstrates that MRSA of a patient at the other most of the nurses. 
That is precisely why händewaschen does, or wearing of gloves and masks a great importance, however, there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals. 
Tröpfcheninfektion MRSA is transmitted or contact in the domestic hospitals, but not always the possibility to isolate infected patients. 
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds short ranked each, although you from epidemiological point a distance of at least 1.5 metres. 
Karolina Böröcz as further points out, it is, unfortunately, in the financially less well-off hospitals even before that used in, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that the emergence of infections positively. 
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequently, or can the further spread of the anthrax stopped, where they are met, Böröcz Karolina. 
Manifesto against MRSA 
Mrsa-infektionen grip on the health caused enormous costs, so you will fight all. 
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or their control of the government program. 
After the first signs of the programme is successful, as published data, is the trend of MRSA-Infektionen in England. 
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has prevented the emergence of multiresistenten prion (including MRSA), and the prevention of infections in hospitals, one of his key priorities.
