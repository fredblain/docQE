Everything is still open 
Mitt Romey said he is not worthy of a presidential Schneemann, to be consulted. 
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally ready to take part in a debate on Youtube in the ordinary voters questions on video and submit them to the candidates. 
None of the issues on Wednesday evening, 28 November, were raised so ridiculously as the Schneemann, the Democrats on global warming in the Youtube debate the other party. 
But the questions and the answers reflected this time, the State of the Republican Party in the elections next year. 
It is not known exactly how the producers of CNN, which mitunterstützten the debate, the would be zeigenden to Youtube Clips tell. 
But in the first half hour of debate, the longest the one issue that has been devoted to immigration in the heart. 
The issue is one of the most potent issues for Republicans. 
The CNN asked a group of hybrid electorate a dials, if you heard things they liked, the company said leaders of the approval than the candidates strict control over the borders of languages. 
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening between Rudy Giuliani was the national champion, and Romney, who is in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire has moved forward. 
Giuliani shackles tried the reputation that he was soft on illegal immigration, when he was mayor of New York. 
He was attacking Romney in the former governor of Massachusetts accused, illegal immigrants for work on his house to have stopped. 
The two, particularly formidable apart as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates an "amnesty" (the illegal regular status and the opportunity for citizenship would be) support. 
Lesser candidates, like Duncan Hunter kongressabgeordneter, a kalifornischer, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, has been able to raise them on this issue. 
None of the two men has serious chances for the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they used and harder than other Immigrationspauke being. 
At least in the area of immigration parts the candidates basically the same views: tighter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants. 
This issue, combined with fears over toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, help the Republicans the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives to forget or. 
But the debate has been clearly problematic than other issues were raised. 
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he has Waffenrestriktionen in the past supported. 
JOHN MCCAIN and Romney debated whether simuliertes drowning as torture should be considered. 
A questioner asked whether the candidates every word of the Bible. 
This meant that Giuliani, arguing that although the Bible his favored book, the story of Jonah and the Europe may not be literally believe. 
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty. 
Mike Huckabee, now, contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent poll in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, said that the death penalty is painful, but necessary. 
When he was pressed whether Jesus they would be in favour of lachte, he said, and Jesus was too smart minding office. 
The chase is exceptionally wide open. 
Huckabees rise in Iowa coincides with Spendenerfolgen Ron Paul's latest and his Beifallsstürmen in the debate by Wednesday. 
These two are hochgeschossen from nothing, because the two wing of the party has yet to be one of the better-known and more traditional candidates. 
In 1980 and 2000, the party of a candidate from the outset and convincing together with winning a message about the grandeur of America and a Zwinkern on both Wings of the party. 
This time, the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
