Budget is through 
Yes, it is. 
The budget is approved. 
What is it about this budget special? 
It is the first budget that this government has drafted, and without the support of the opposition by the Koalitionsmehrheit was adopted. 
For the current year, even with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because it approved Sobotka minister (the party) had presented ČSSD, and therefore could not afford to reject it. 
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government was nothing dramatic about this time. 
The Congress of Deputies, approved this traditionally little noticed, but the most significant act calmly. 
This is a certain irony. 
Everything governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether we like it or not. 
The budget is an integral part of politics, but it is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition. 
This is for the media dankbareres the issue, so you devote more attention to him. 
A dispute among politicians in public is much more interesting than sober figures. 
The budgets were among the last Socialist governments under three weaknesses in the budget for the year 2008 can eliminate all at once. 
The first is the high proportion of expenditure, the legitimately binding, and it is not only the pensions, but also social spending, " the implicit ' ČSSD coalition and KSČM (communists) last year before the elections. 
The second is the budget policy as are basic shortages of Schwachpunkts. 
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e., the budget deficits of the communities. 
The greatest risk is not the state budget deficit. 
This budget is publicly and eingermaßen under control. 
A real time bomb is the budget deficit of communities. 
Many mayors in order but revenue from tax, levies and bank credit other sources of investment, often foolhardy Bond, through its halls in excess indebted. 
In recent years, they succeeded, the debt by massive selling shares of energy and other networks in the train of privatization of state had received pay. 
Now, the source said grinding to a halt. 
As far as we are only at official and verifiable facts, we note that: 
Our economy for several years, as the rest of the world is going through a period of the ČSSD vaunted sponsors. 
This was a unique opportunity for their governments, public finances in order. 
Instead, these governments indebted to the state of even more. 
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have spent much more sensible than our republic. 
This is a great shame, mainly the previous governments. 
We are among the countries which, on a global scale, the least of poverty are threatened. 
A nassiven programmes, which are unfortunately just in the last few years in cleaning up unnecessarily were blown out. 
Even if it succeeded in achieving a part of the nonsensical populist spending, which this year before the elections were adopted, it is clear that in the near future to an increase in the retirement age and a pension reform, then ends virtually any policy in this country, and regardless of who is in power, he will remain a purely run. 
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that officials from ruling politicians, which is the largest portion of tax revenue mechanically on pensions and social spending. 
Therefore, this year's budget is not a revolution, but can only the sweeping Pflichtausgaben normal expenditure. 
The scheduled for 2008 deficit of 70 billion kronor would have been quite superfluous in previous governments in the last ten years had spent only. 
If we do not want it really comes down to that ruling politicians mere administrators, then we have to be patient and not too strong coalition government, but which are aware that the state is just so much to spend, as he in taxes and fees to occupy the calm in preparing further reform laws. 
Only they allow a gradual implementation of a balanced budget.
