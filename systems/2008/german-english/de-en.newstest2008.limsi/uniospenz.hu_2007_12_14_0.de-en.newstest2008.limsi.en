There is a heated debate between developed and developing countries in progress. 
The United States has already signalled that they have specific figures do not want to negotiate, but would you be prepared until 2020 greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 25-40 percent. 
The other major issue of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are ready, apart from the reduction of emissions of the developing countries, both financially and technologically. 
It was also an agreement on the support of developing countries.
