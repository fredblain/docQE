The atmosphere of Venus could offer a glimpse of the future of the earth Show 
Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday. 
Data on a European raumschiffes orbit to demonstrate that a abgewandten the planet zwilling the Earth is still more than was previously understood. 
Venus planetarische is the näheste neighbour of the earth. 
The two worlds have roughly the same size and Planetenbahnen have similar, but Venus is a little closer to the sun. 
Billions of years ago had Venus conditions that are very similar to those on Earth, and would have been even livable, scientists believe today. 
But because of rampant Kohlendioxid-Treibhauseffektes, the erosion of the atmosphere with the sun and Rotationstempo slower Venus, gave a very different entwicklungskurs. 
Today is the Planet of water and a heiss temperature, which is enough to melt lead by Hurrikan-starken winds and Blitzstürmen were devastated. 
The findings of the spacecraft went Venus Express the European Space Agency, the planned for a year has investigated, provide a sobering look at how the planet in view of the catastrophic climate change could develop. 
Professor Fred Taylor of the physics department at the University of Oxford, one of the head of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is clear why the climate at Venus so different to the earth, while the planet, otherwise we are pretty much the same." 
"Our new data, it will be possible to construct a scenario in which the Venus billions of years ago as the Earth has begun, possibly with a bewohnbarer environment."
