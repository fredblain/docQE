</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the case of the parteitreuen voters, the difference clearly fells from thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates: More than two thirds (71 percent) contrast with a fifth (20 percent) agreement for the MSZP. </seg>
<seg id="4"> MDF and SZDSZ lie according to inquiry under the parliamentary entry hurdle: They come to two percent in the entire population. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The number of the party voters grew in both warehouses by a percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In comparison with the last low point, the general economic atmosphere worsened - the share which "noticeably" judge the economic situation of the country "badly" was never yet so high (41 percent) previously while they consider further 46 percent "bad quite". </seg>
<seg id="7"> After more hopeful views in the spring and summer, the families see the change of their financial situation again more pessimistically. </seg>

<seg id="13"> If 35% had still spoken in favor of the whereabouts of the government and the head of government following the unrests in the past October, this share amounts to only 20% today while the relative majority (33 percent), the solution only into new choices see. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Hypermarkets in the Budaörser trade area kept the average price increase of 16% of the last year of this year as well, with the difference that there was no increase in the value-added tax. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Articles from Napi Gazdaság </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In the Budaörser trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" increased of this year as well about 16 percent, however price increases were registered on all hypermarkets of via 1.000 HOOF. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After the prices are "davongaloppiert" on the food markets in the past December, price increase prozentuell did not turn out to be drastic, compared with the anyway high, earlier exit level. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, it has an effect on the consumers certainly as a deterrent that that is not for which they had still paid in the last year far under 9.000 HOOF of this year available once for 10.000 HOOF. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The price of the "Napi" goods basket crossed the magische 10.000 hoof border about at least 91 HOOF on the investigated markets. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The highest price amounted to 10.573 HOOF. </seg>
<seg id="9"> (The price was next to 6.800 HOOF in 6800.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The prices for Unicum and lively fish almost remained on previous year level, heavily the prices for turkey breast nettings, nut and poppy by contrast increased. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the central statistical office of Hungary, in the case of Auchan, there was however 1kg bread rolls for 139 Forint. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It gave up no competition limited price slump with the product under 200 Forint. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The price was surprising a two liter of Coke Cola pledge bottle here of under 200 Forint, therefore the drink cost inclusive pledge only 257 HOOF. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless, Cora performed this year in the "Napi" Warenkorbs comparison Auchan the most expensively and the most suitably. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Our calculations showed that Cora the prices in the "Napi" goods basket in comparison with the Christmas prices in the past year about 15 while Tesco and Auchan in each case increased about 18 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The difference between the most inexpensive goods basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the year of this year amounted to 12% while the raise comprised between most inexpensive goods basket of the past year and most expensive of the current year 21%. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The average price rise amounted to 1.480,00 HOOF. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The average price increase was still next to 1.206,00 Forint in the previous year, however the value-added tax raise made noticeable for itself with the prices for last Christmas. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Exact this procedure met the trade badly: Apparently the department stores were not able to decide so rightly what price chips they should use in the individual articles since the effects of the price increase were unabsehbar on the consumption behavior. </seg>
<seg id="20"> (If the vendor plans the circulation speed of a product badly, he can fall about essential profits in the price span which follows the traffic intensity.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The price increase of the "Napi" goods basket turned out to be Mehwertsteuer caused so radically in the past year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 about 1720 Forint whereas the price difference was with the most inexpensive basket mere of 844 Forint. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Such extremes were not observed this year as the most expensive basket cost about 1.630,00 Forint more than in the previous year and even in the case of the cheapest one there was a price rise of 1.284,00 Forint. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> A catastrophic price increase was manifested in the comparison of the two last Christmas seasons, the price of the daily consumer items on the hypermarkets increased for months less in 20 more than 30 percent. </seg>
<seg id="24"> (This again does not confirm the data of the central statistical office of Hungary unconditionally: The statistical office established one with some basic foods in the period of 12 months more than 30-prozentige price increase. </seg>
<seg id="25"> So for example next to flour also in the case of eggs.) </seg>
<seg id="26"> If one however throws a look into the "Napi" goods basket, this seems in the case of almost latter impossible since the price level of the product which cost already in the previous year at worst about scarcely more itself than 10 percent rose. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Flour suppliers are obviously in a more powerful position, than the egg suppliers - in any case they were able to shift the drastic price increase onto the Multis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is reported continuously by good years. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not at all look at the prices more. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Large amounts are purchased from all, holdable foods go over the counters in pallets. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Wednesday vormittag there were endless queues in the case of the spot as suddenly the number of the customers exploded. </seg>
<seg id="32"> However, a smaller customer frequency is reported by the country so that many Multis are complained in the case of the opinion researchers that they could not reach even the planned turnover, that is not only in the case of foods but also in the case of nachhaltigen consumption materials. </seg>

<seg id="1"> In many cases one saves at disinfectants </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> .</seg>
<seg id="3"> The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the practising inheritance placing of the beds, the overloading of personnel - everything factors which are not precisely zuträglich for the damming of the infections, so the leading doctor of the national Epidemiologiezentrums. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many cases one saves in the case of the disinfectants as well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Traumatologie department of the János hospital, a MRSA infection was diagnosed recently. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That against antibiotic resistente bacterium was found in a male patient who was delivered to the hospital after a serious accident. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The patient was insulated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here. </seg>
<seg id="9"> .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Until 10. December of this year, infections initiated by multiresistente virus were reported from hospitals 1094 at the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system, so the leading doctor of the national Epidemiologiezentrums, Karolina Böröcz. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Infections initiated by multiresistente virus were therefore registered so much, in the hospitals for certain, the true figure might however be higher. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, that against Methicillin Oxacillin resistenten Staphylococcus aureus. </seg>
<seg id="13"> .</seg>
<seg id="14"> Sa limited infections (sore throat, tonsillitis, ignitions of the skin or wounds as for example) usually react well to antibiotics, they are heilbar well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> If the means are however measured out too high or used inexpertly, respondierenden bacteria antibiotic resistente which spread out in the hospitals quickly under corresponding conditions result from that well. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In the case of patients with weakened or durably badly functioning immune systems, but also at age or patients with small body weight can cause these bacteria difficult infections, as for example wound infection or blood poisoning, therefore sepsis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The MRSA infection is belongs nothing special, such occurrences for the medical director according to of the János hospital, to the Krankehausalltag. </seg>
<seg id="18"> One may confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi - there is not only MRSA there where it is not looked for. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Resistent against antibiotics </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "Such patients are insulated, the maintenance personnel Gummihandschuhe and masks carry with the supply and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - Tibor Nyulasi so. </seg>
<seg id="21"> .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Test takings too rare </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The majority of the infections initiated by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, however the currently reigning conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the Eindämmung of the arising or the expansion of the multiresistenten virus, say Karolina Böröcz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and retirement homes, the hospitals should investigate the delivered patients and insulate MRSA-infizierte immediately. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In the Hungarian hospitals, the microbiological test taking is not however so frequently practiced. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Not least of all, because there is vonseiten of the state ill cash-register no allowances for this investigation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Most cases would come along only then to the light of day if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, so the medical manager of the Epidemiologiezentrums. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Vonseiten there are strict recommendations for the European union, to the corresponding application of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there are however guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and Krankheitsbilder in Hungary as well. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Antibiotic therapies should be purposeful that is, microbiological investigations are necessary in order that no resistance to the means can develop, this general instruction of hospitals is always complied with not as well. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Under out-patient or in the basic supply the patients, microbiological test takings are even even more rarely, so Karolina Böröcz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Is saved in the case of the disinfectants </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Verify scientific proofs that MRSA is transferred from a patient on the other the most frequently by the maintenance personnel. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Therefore the hand washing or the wear of gloves and masks is just of a great significance, however there are considerable deficiencies in the hospitals in this area as well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> MRSA is transferred by droplet infection or contact, in the indigenous hospitals, it is not however always possible to insulate the infizierten patients. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The rooms even often are overfilled, the beds connected barely although there should be a distance from at least 1,5 meter between them from epidemiologischer sight. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> As Karolina Böröcz continues to mark, it unfortunately even occurs financially for less well placed hospitals into that that one saves in the case of disinfectants, there are few male nurses, many patients - everything factors which favor the arising of infections absolutely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there or the further distribution of the virus can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, so Karolina Böröcz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Government program against MRSA </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> To get MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs for the health insurance, therefore they are fought everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="40"> In England for example, the prevention of MRSA or their Eindämmung in the government program were recorded. </seg>
<seg id="41"> After first signs, the program is successful - published data as occupy, are the tendency of the MRSA infections in England declining. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The European center for medical prevention (ECDC) declared the prevention of the arising of multiresistenten viruses ((under this, even MRSA) as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Political Capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to the department for risk analysis (Risk Analysing division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian guard founded in this August with support of the "movement for a better Hungary" lifted Hungary and the region's risk in several respect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> It is been statement in the institute's "risk warning report" among other things: The highest political risk the "increase of the already existing ethnischen tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary which could lead even at short notice to violent ethnischen confrontations" represents in context with the Hungarian guard's activities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The strategy of the Hungarian guard who aims supposedly at the provocation of such a confrontation thus is main reason for that the research institute. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> As reported, this is seen persons responsible in this politically as a failure of sides: "People of the public life left representatives of radical political groupings the discussion of the Roma question which were now based their political strategy on the Roma Hungary contrast". </seg>
<seg id="6"> One supposes that this intensify the problem, make the rational dialog impossible, extremities would favor as well as increase the probability of violent confrontations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Forschungsinsitut not least of all "considerably" means "harmfully" thanks to the enormous attention of sides of the indigenous and foreign media, "Hungary's picture abroad" ausserdem which would have activities of the Hungarian guard", what the trust in the stability and democratic ripeness affects particularly". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> We remember: Since fall 2006, the re-organization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been continuous in the lift so that, since summer 2007, several have been founded organizations naming "national self-defense organization". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "It is mean to these groupings that they in each case define as a civil organization while they boast openly about this, their members on - armed now and then - to prepare defense tasks (catastrophe protection, state defense, Ordnungshütung), with reference to the police's unsuitability the police's, the army or the state himself", it was called. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> And further: In accordance with that method which attempts, that everything occurs passed away political efforts based on the policy and party peevishness of the population as a middleclass initiative to tarnen. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The emphasis of the civil character and the organization form therefore serve for the avoidance of legal hurdles which could emerge in the course of the entry at court only - there is not a political strategy at the same time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> As one must find in the analysis, the activities present a risk-increasing factor to the Hungarian guard for the relations with the neighbor states as well. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "In the last months, the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighbor states as a potenzielle danger source, the confirmation of its own antiHungary policy so sees some ultranationalistischer politicians of certain neighbor countries in the arising of the Hungarian guard." </seg>
<seg id="14"> That everything has effects on the political stability of the region "- it was called." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As reported, the activities of the Hungarian guard with those of the Bulgarian national guard are comparable, the foundation of which was announced in August 2007 by the right extreme Bulgarian national union (BNU). </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the background of the Bulgarian guard's arising, the Roma mass riotings which took place in a district from Sofia (Krasna Poljana) were. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BNU took the occurrences right to the cause for founding the national guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization the "national protection" is. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In your opinion, the state was however remained noticeable inactive and indifferent for years a regular "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria namely in the past 17 - Political Capital so. </seg>
<seg id="20"> And further: The initiative would have stepped away a violent debate in the Bulgarian public. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As said that the increased risk for ethnische confrontations is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard to resistance tacks. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Since the Hungarian guard's activities show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian national guard to date, it is not to be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react, with the organization of their own protection to the threats, it is been statement in the risk warning report of Political Capital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Attila Juhász, research director in the case of Political Capital said on inquiry of the report office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Risk analysis reports would be published annually and risk-changing tendencies should be recognizable, the public opinion is informed, as in the fall by handing over the Risikowarnberichtes. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> In Hungary, holidays are exactly regulated legally so that the procedure for the reorganization of the work days meanwhile was established all around the holidays, however the coming year of less such days give presents us. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In the EU as well and in America, one understands for something else by "holiday". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Hungarian right system differentiates between state holidays and work free days. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Work free days are usually ecclesiastical holidays or are related to significant historical events. </seg>
<seg id="6"> We celebrate New Year as well, for example: Both the last day is can rest the old work free days - latter alone already thus the ones the that celebrate and the first day of the new year New Years Eve. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In the whole year, we have a total of fourteen holidays. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The state holidays are 15. March which reminds of the revolution of 1848 and 23. October, the intending day of the revolution of 1956. </seg>
<seg id="9"> On the 20. August, the state foundation is celebrated, on the 1. May the work, on the 1. and 2. November, we intend our dead ones. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Furthermore there are two holidays to Easter, Pentecost and Christmas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a week-end, the procedure for the "work day shift" proved itself in the cases in which we would work only a day before or after the holiday. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The price of the lengthened week-ends is however that we must in front of that quite probably work on the Saturdays or must go to school. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> When this day which fells before or after the holiday should be processed last finally, it has been established by the work secretary in its own regulation for long years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The right regulation is likewise valid for all employers and employees, for public employees and civil servants of the public service. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Only companies and installations in which the business is continued without interruption, therefore also on the holidays, are excluded. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Pay is brought the work order something only by the holidays at the end of the year confused: The life stops from the 24. December positively in this country as most for the days take specially time adjustment or for that the this canceled vacation between Christmas and New Years Eves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In the next year, more holidays fall into the week middle or on the end of the week so that there will be less Umdisponierungen at the work days, than this year. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The calendar is at first "put on the head" all around the day of the work in order that people can stay equal to four days at the piece home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saturday, the 26. April become a work day in order that the Friday, 2. May can be a day of rest. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The second Umdisponierung is connected with the holiday on the 23. October: On Saturday, the 18. October, one will have to process the Friday, 24. October first. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> E mails that we forget to send, language reports that we never receive - harmless lies which do not at all strike ourselves more: They take "color" into the everyday life at the workplace. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The question is mere whether one gets used to these small bother or positions himself one the challenge better and attempts this misleadingly, for other angry situations intentionally to vermweiden. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Tips. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Sorry, I forgot to align for you that someone called of the marketing department" - a colleague says. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That one by this means neglected a meeting? </seg>
<seg id="7"> At best one regrets it and attempts to make up for it again by calling perhaps with the marketing department and admitting reumütig, one would have forgotten to align the report which is the less usual method). </seg>
<seg id="8"> .</seg>
<seg id="9"> Before one entangles oneself in embarassing excuses, one should consider with which what one can give and attempt its colleagues really unpleasant moments to avoid these situations intentionally. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Something lent what does not belong to one itself? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> It scarcely gives something sinewy as if one grasps according to a document, Bürozubehör or the telephone, it is not however there. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Yesterday did the notebook device still lie on the desk - early this morning is it away? </seg>
<seg id="13"> Or does does become reveal believed ballpoint pens to this lost for example on a colleague's desk? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Without one should ask lend oneself nothing of the colleagues, for they are annoyed * if they determine that something got away. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Therefore, no envelopes or mail its from the office into the pocket put, for it could meet one itself: none there more if however needs man's immediately. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Getratsche over the colleagues' private life? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> There is no effective means, a gossip which has already been put in the world to stop. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Who with whom, which made? </seg>
<seg id="19"> Where and why? </seg>
<seg id="20"> One should not tie for each to the nose if possible the information (or suppositions) on the colleagues' private life! </seg>
<seg id="21"> And if someone is however opened and betrays us its innermost secret, we should not misuse this trust! </seg>
<seg id="22"> The best one is as silent a grave instead of just not to align that present ones even if others know information as well about the problems of the colleague. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Reported without reason ill? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If one calls in the office in order to present himself ill with reference to tormenting headache because one feels just unwell or would only like to rest himself simply, one should realize one: The colleagues must now wear out its own work, unaufschiebbare treatments, projects with fixed deadlines instead of one itself. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The colleague therefore not übel participates! </seg>
<seg id="26"> If one already knows at the Vortag that one will not get it into the office on the next day or that something could interfere why one must stay home, one should report it on time in order that neither the colleagues nor the leader are confronted unexpectedly with the absence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Hum, tittering, phoning </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> One is deepened just in its work but is disturbed suddenly by the loud tittering of the colleagues? </seg>
<seg id="29"> Unintentional a telephone conversation overheard that one better should not have heard? </seg>
<seg id="30"> One would not supposed to the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations( that one holds beyond their heads), tramplings, constant scolding or moaning nerven. </seg>
<seg id="31"> That everything can be very disturbing even if they are not deepened right in a task (write, plan, organize). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Is the other always guilty? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> .</seg>
<seg id="34"> If possible one should not make excuses on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues! </seg>
<seg id="35"> The best one admits its errors for myself and excuses if others were affected by this as well! </seg>
<seg id="36"> The question how one make up for the error again which can make up neglected is only all too appropriate! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In the office - a feelings as home? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Training pants and Schlapfen: Nothing however lost comfortably home in the office! </seg>
<seg id="39"> Not once one should so dress oneself leger if the job allowed it really! </seg>

<seg id="11"> He created the breakthrough with its project (Zagar) and its music which fuses elements from jazz, Electronic and pop but had approached him first as one with the request to compose the Soundtrack to a film (e.g. </seg>

<seg id="25"> In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, that is not Mainstream and Underground or Alternativ and pop but rather commercial and honest. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="30"> B. Zs.: Pop music has a greater tradition abroad, particularly to the west of us. </seg>
<seg id="31"> There not only teenagers or men in his twenties go to concert but also the older public. </seg>
<seg id="32"> They pursue the trends in pop music which happens round about them much more attentively because they consider them a part of the contemporary culture as well. </seg>

<seg id="34"> Is it important, who, where, hear how much your music? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> B. Zs.: Naturally it is a good feelings to see that more and more come for our concerts. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We however never composed for the market. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In the case of us, music does not result in order to serve a purpose but rather for a certain reason. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The role of the public is usually marked with the concerts where there is already a reciprocal reciprocity but which there is again only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Nevertheless, one struck me: If you want to make it of all right, you are no longer interesting. </seg>

<seg id="40"> hvg.hu: How widely would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi? </seg>
<seg id="41"> He is as a soloist on the way and set up his career more in the west. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> B. Zs.: We do not go its path really, times completely disregarded the fact that one attempts again and again, this into our music hineinzuinterpretieren. </seg>
<seg id="43"> We see rather than Teamplayer, the one in the musical presence of the other one trust and they unfolded. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Originally comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi unausweichlich were natural as several come to its band as far as we are concerned and took another route. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> hvg.hu: Wings of Love "in first place" is in the Charts of mr2 Petofi. </seg>

<seg id="47"> Was the opening with a somewhat more popular style inszeniert in the direction of a wider public conscious? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit which should then hold out as a train horse for the album. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In this song, it is a matter of more. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It was intended as a finale of the album with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult subjects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers? </seg>
<seg id="52"> Why was what just the guide principle? her what was the guide principle? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a Gospel well-behaved chorus. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Then the idea came to combine the chorus from gifted soloists of the indigenous music scene. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Thus sechsköpfige chorus resulted - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Eniko "Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh" therefore "-, we then baptized that apäter" Underground stars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> hvg.hu: Did you just as want to have the song or do have it the girls mitgestaltet? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> B. Zs.: There has been the number for a long while in the instrumental version but however when the material was finished for the album, we imagined that this number still "needs something". </seg>
<seg id="58"> The Akkordenabfolge positively asked for a song voice. </seg>
<seg id="59"> I still sang in the melody in the same night, they learned the girls later. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Everything came practically alarmingly spontaneously at once and. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I can remember that I was considerable elektrisiert then, but it has already needed the "stars" as well. </seg>
<seg id="62"> With my voice alone, the song would have never become so strong. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> hvg.hu: One had both on the record and with the concert however girls would be the impression, the one in the background. </seg>
<seg id="64"> It gives no solo Part (refrained from the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, completely sing together and are not louder, than music, therefore their singing about music is not only accompanied. </seg>
<seg id="65"> They were on the arena as well rear. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Is it intention? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67"> B.Zs.: That they are stood at the rear was so because of purely technical problems. </seg>
<seg id="68"> However, we wanted to send no solo roles to them intentionally. </seg>
<seg id="69"> In the number, it is also a matter of this that one should forget its Ego a bit, forget who from where come and where on the way is, we allow simply that these certain wings, the wings of love emporheben us. </seg>
<seg id="70"> I would like that others as well feel this euphoric status that we felt when the song resulted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> hvg.hu: Which was the most expensive song? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> B. Zs.: During musical accomplish work real of none at all it, more more difficult tasks set rather with the mixture. </seg>
<seg id="73"> For example with "Dorian Gray's dilemma" in which I play on a concert piano or in the case of "Rock'nRoll 'Goes To The Girls" where the Groove did not want to function longer, however gradually everything untied, as in the case of a Puzzle.' </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number of the new album? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75"> B. Zs.: That changes continuously with the concerts and also where I have album "losgelasssen" now. </seg>

<seg id="4"> It namely came on his account about almost five billion Euro. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> It however appears rather in such a way that Kerviel was only a large player who wanted to put it his colleague immediately, surely was not furthermore incapable. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In contrast to all large bank houses, he recognized the crisis punctually by the amerikanischenn mortgage market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "He is psychically more weak," it was to be heard from the mouth of its superior who reported him to the police. </seg>
<seg id="8"> As is however apparent from statements Kerviels which published the French media, for example daily paper Le moons, he was a person who had achieved at the end of last year with its businesses profits amounting to 1,6 billion Euro. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Crisis not only in America </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> "Everything what he wanted, money was to be earned for my bank," he asserts in his statement. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In the summer, it had succeeded in profiting one half billion Euro right from the American crisis. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He had namely already spotted the opportunity in addition at the year beginning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> In February, there were quite first reports about that that so-called Sub Prime mortgages as they are given income weak customers or such which had payment problems already earlier, into difficulties would be fallen. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Influence on the entire economy should have this crisis however not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kerviel did not believe that and kept right. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the end of the year, he had his profit high screwed except for 1,6 billion Euro. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "Had already as I this first half billion earned, I did not know as I should explain that," admit Kerviel and say further that he kept nothing definitive to himself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> During the entire interrogation, he admits that he forged documents, in order that one would not come for him to the tricks. </seg>
<seg id="19"> He even succeeded in leading his leaders behind the light even if the Eurex stock market was interested gradually in its businesses. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Did fear to fly up him? </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> From where did he take the courage to risk so a lot? </seg>
<seg id="25"> He had to develop his position for himself gradually. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> He stepped into the Société Générale in year 2000, direct after he had concluded on, his studying at the University of Lyon. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Its year salary amounted to approximately 51000 dollar. </seg>
<seg id="28"> After two years, he was already assistant of a broker and he of independent brokers with a year content of 90000 dollar became in year 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Nevertheless, he knew that he will never earn as much as others. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "I knew already with my first conversation in year 2005 that one observed me." </seg>
<seg id="31"> Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, "explained Kerviel the investigation civil servant." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, it is managed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The state household is endorsed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> What is what is special in this household? </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is the first household that this government designed and that was accepted without aid the opposition by the coalition majority. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This for the current year was endorsed still with support of the CSSD (social democrats) because secretary Sobotka (from this party) had presented him and the CSSD was not therefore able to permit itself rejecting him. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In contrast with the lively debating before the co-ordination on the mistrust application against the government, nothing dramatic occurred this time. </seg>

<seg id="9"> That is so to speak paradoxical. </seg>
<seg id="10"> All ruling begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the household whether that pleases one or not. </seg>
<seg id="11"> .</seg>
<seg id="12"> That is a more grateful subject for the media and therefore they devote more attention to him. </seg>
<seg id="13"> .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The state households suffered at the past social democratic governments from than three weak points that the household for year 2008 can not at the same time remove: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In which case the first one it is not only concerns the high share of outputs which are obliging of law's the pensions but also about social outputs on which the "silent" coalition decided of CSSD and KSCM (Communist) in the last year before the choices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The second one is the deficitary budget policy as a result of the first weak point. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The third limitation exists in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the local authorities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The greatest risk is not however the state budget deficit. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This household is public and eingermaßen under control. </seg>
<seg id="20"> A true time bomb is however the budget deficit of the local authorities. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Many mayors gave in order to open up except takingses from taxes, taxes and bank credits further sources for investments, often debt orders mostly from by which they caused their city halls in the excess. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In the last years, they succeeded, with these debts by numerous sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks that they had received from the state in the train of the denationalization in paying off. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Now this source has already dried up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we determine that: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> our economy for some years as the remainder of the world, a growth phase go through, whose the CSSD is praised without Unterlass. </seg>
<seg id="26"> That represented a single possibility of their governments to take public finances into order. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Instead, these governments however involved the state @QD even more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Other countries, apart from a couple of exceptions as Hungarians, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, economized a lot more rationally than our republic. </seg>
<seg id="29"> That is a giant disgrace which is to be attributed predominantly to the earlier governments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> We are among the countries which seen, in the global scale, are threatened at the least of poverty. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Therefore no nassiven social programs are necessary which were unfortunately blown up right in the last years completely superfluously in giant size. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Even if it was is successful clear, a part of the absurd populistischen outputs which were discharged this year before the choices to delete that if shifting the pension entry age and a pension reform does not take place soon, then practically every policy ends up in this country and, who is in power all the same, nothing will remain for him as a pure management. </seg>
<seg id="33"> It is exaggerated only easily if one says that then who will divide the largest part of the control takingses mechanically into pensions and social outputs of reigning politicians civil servants. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Therefore the this year's household can not be a revolution but rather can stop only the expulsion of normal outputs by duty outputs. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The deficit intended for 2008 of 70 billion crowns would be quite superfluous if earlier governments had not outputted in the last ten years, which only went. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If we do not want really to take place that pure administrative civil servants come from reigning politicians, then we must be patient and wish for this not all too greatest coalition government which he is is however as able to take conscious that the state can only output as much at taxes and charges, rest with the preparation of further reform laws. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In order to say the truth that I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Its driving characteristics were not a lot worth, the quality of the gearshift, one was able to describe as rather sub-average for the control as well as the processing. </seg>
<seg id="4"> However now its successor, Peugeot 207 are, on the market and this is about much better. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The station wagon with the designation sw is another piece further and only remains for me to revise my opinion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When I had tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, I had to complain myself for example over the head liberty that is too small on the rear seats. </seg>
<seg id="7"> There are now no longer these complaints, for the car body of the station wagon is formed in such a way that even two meter men will not suffer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Quickly further </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> I go through the internal equipment only briefly in order not too very much to repeat me. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It concerns a rightly successful design where I have objections only because of the kümmerlichen medium tunnel. </seg>
<seg id="11"> .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The seats are comfortable and past are the times where we possibly complained about too short seats or head rests. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Even the side hold fundamentally improved in comparison with the 206. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Regarding the space offer, one can feel the enlarged measurements of the car body here as well. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In the station wagon, the lack that is already mentioned of head liberty is also remedied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Suitcases in the trunk </seg>

<p>
<seg id="17"> The main point on this car is however the load room. </seg>

<seg id="19"> .</seg>
<seg id="20"> They do not disturb, leave auseinanderziehen and establish even more difficult objects. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="21"> However, we talk about the drawer volume. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It amounts to according to table in basic equipment 428 liters, which is a rather average value in comparison with the competition. </seg>
<seg id="23"> However not in comparison with vehicle of this class best-selling in the Tschechien, Skoda Fabia Combi. </seg>
<seg id="24"> If we compare for the 207 sw with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we determine that the Peugeot stays behind by clearly marked 52 liters. </seg>
<seg id="25"> .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> 120 PS in four series </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline motor with lift area 1,6 liter and a performance by 88 kW. </seg>
<seg id="29"> And honestly, said, a 1600 Kubik motor should appear that a family Hatchback actuates. </seg>
<seg id="30"> He is low, has a small consumption and pulls away well. </seg>
<seg id="31"> If I compare him with its counter piece in the case of Skoda who sometimes affects than its exhaust with a rag would be stopped up, then I can only be inspired by him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The price list says volumes </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The price of this car is not just national. </seg>
<seg id="34"> But we must remember that we tested a well equipped car with a spacious Innneren and a very good motor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> The basic price of the car with the 1400er gasoline motor in height of 329900 crowns still concerns. </seg>
<seg id="36"> With our motor it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Equipment Premium of the test car again hits with 80000 crowns in addition to beech. </seg>
<seg id="38"> We however had Kopfairbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper release, electrical window lifter rear and and... </seg>
<seg id="39"> Thus the car costs by and large simple 531900 crowns. </seg>
<seg id="40"> That is a lot, however the additional equipment of a Fabia adds up you once and you will arrive with a very similar sum. </seg>

<seg id="27"> It is bad that the debts climb but on the other hand this shows that one can undertake something, already before the pension reform comes, "commented on Pikora the data." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Better than expected </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> It comes from the financing strategy and the handling of the Staatsschulden for 2007 that the government for this year had planned to record 159,2 billion crowns. </seg>

<seg id="5"> However the Aufdeckung that a rich businessman disguised over four years under the name of other people contributions to the British ruling Labour party over more than 650.000 pound (1.3 million dollars) and that the party neglected to report this, is would somewhat have gotten along without that of the umkämpfte Gordon Brown well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When two months ago the minister-president had avoided the demand for a choice, the intelligence of the Britons insultingly in dämliche way by having asserted that opinion inquiries would not have influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a sturdy, efficient government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Instead, such as Vince Cable, this in increasing measure sharp ingenious representation chairmen this liberally democrats, it expressed, the Brown feared once developed from Stalin to Mr. Bean. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The clumsy rescue of Northern skirt, a hit bank, showed regulatory weakness and bad judgement capital under fire. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Bad set proposals for the change in the control laws thought through have enterprise associations against the government. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The control official loss of individual data of 25 million persons demonstrated unvorstellbare administrative Pfuschereien. </seg>
<seg id="11"> A trio of generals in the retirement started for a rebellion in the upper house from protestation against reductions of soldier outputs: To be secretary of the armed forces, they asserted, a part time job is. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now there are the diverse contributions of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labours general secretary (and their former fulfillment director) have already stepped back. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Nothing from that means that, Brown irrevokably, direction breaks up withdrawal. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point according to which they feel it impossibly to rule. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Neither like nor does people trust politicians, however do they normally hold back their scepticism if a new troop takes the office. </seg>
<seg id="16"> If it is clear once that it is improbable that a Prime Minister improves the situation and he does not yet need be once for a long time, this opening past: the public service begins become undicht; begin the cabinet secretaries chat; the press looks for bad reports; and the government becomes defensive and objectiveless. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In a manner, the position of Brown is specially difficult because he can not assert in contrast to other political leaders that he is a new broom. </seg>
<seg id="18"> He Tony Blair would so like to deny, he was his upper second lieutenant. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The problems with Northern skirt and that control competence documents, for example, hang together with decisions that Brown made as a chancellor of the Ministry of Finance. </seg>
<seg id="20"> And even if this the voters were do not not possibly involved come directly in Blairs misfortunes - as in the case of the long "money for nobility title investigation" of political party financing - from this that he was it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In spite of this, Browns situation is not completely so bad, looks like them </seg>
<seg id="22"> The offenses are not as awful as the conservatives describe it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> As, in the case of Mr. Bean, no one died, or was cheated completely. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And the antidote, painful such as it is, it is to be delivered, which stalinistische tendencies always promised Browns naturally: A reliable sturdily and slightly brutal government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The new fuss about political contributions is a good example. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The garboeske Abrahams which compares its contributions with its gifts beneficial to the public says wishes him no public recognition for its well disposed. </seg>
<seg id="27"> That perhaps like that is but he was not entitled to the decision on this. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The laws against Anonymität for large political contribution payers are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has to know a right to that who can buy for himself access to this which rules the country. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Watts known which would says have him about Abrahams arrangement but not that it is illegal, will have to position itself some questions obviously; just so Jon Mendlesohn, Labours main finance one drivers which was told over the separate contributions in October. </seg>
<seg id="30"> However up to now Brown is not involved: There is nothing that after that indicates that he knew about these confusions although the largest part of the payments was made after its office takeover in June. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Up to now the Prime Minister accomplished half of the work. </seg>
<seg id="32"> .</seg>
<seg id="33"> In this instance the "teachings to be pulled out of" this are not very much complicated. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If the law was broken, it is a thing for the police. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Aside from the fact it must gives make other things Mr. Brown how to find something a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in the public life who has been vacant for six months and to advance with a drastic reform of political party financing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> That would become requires to co-operate of the Hardlinern of the Labour with the conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relation with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party accomplice such as Mr. Brown. </seg>
<seg id="37"> However he should be conscious of some partial facts. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The conservatives have a clear direction now in the opinion inquiries; he has to regain two years about voters; and the only path as he can reach a victory is through unanfechtbare Rechtschaffenheit and sturdy competence. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Again two films with the Balkans war occupy themselves with "The Hunting party" and "murrderous peace". </seg>
<seg id="3"> However do not both convince. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Either the concepts set to Action too much and Geballer or else they are too stirring blessed. </seg>
<seg id="5"> There even Richard Gere can not help in "The Hunting party". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The good report at first: To be sure the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, however calculated there, in the gloomy rear country of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere was now found again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> We had lost the nicest man of the eighty years finally from the eyes because all too many kind unimportant roles drove from one in well feeling films for women and all too many press conferences on the subject Buddhism as if desire for looking at. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Now Richard Gere is sudden the most important argument, "The Hunting party - Wenn the hunter" perhaps however "becomes" to look at (film titles must be Warum really always so long today and wirr as locomotive leader tariff contracts) "to the hunted". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> However in spite of this Trumpfes, "The Hunting party" continues only the endless series of failed Balkans war films together with the German production of "murrderous peaces" which start in this week as well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> With "murrderous peace," one can make short process: The film deals with two German soldiers in the Kosovo (Adrian Topol, max. Riemelt) which saves a Serbian from kosovarischen snipers, would which this also still falls in love one with them promptly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> .</seg>
<seg id="13"> It however for that remains a type of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway with war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> On the other hand, can be investigated exemplarily at "The Hunting party" absolutely why there was never yet a correctly good Balkans war film really. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The story of three US war reporters who set out in order to track down the Serbian upper war criminal "the fox" could perhaps have become a new "Apocalypse Now" another time with another director and another Drehbuchautor (both in personnel union Richard Shepard). </seg>
<seg id="16"> For the Storys are alike yes frappierend: Small teams go both times into the forest in order to accomplish something, which the soldiers and for both times it becomes a journey into the insanity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting party" is that one is not Simon Hunt not simply the descended cynic with heart, he we are presented as this at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="18"> No, the Script must attribute obendrein to him another romantic affair with a muslimischen Bosnian murdered later. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Finally "The Hunting party" goes the brook runter at the time when is successful for the reporters within the last five minutes in the Zeitrafferverfahren that, which Nato, CIA and all head money hunter of the world did not manage in five years: Catch the war criminal and leave the muslimischen Bosnians him for the just revenge. </seg>
<seg id="20"> That is so bad that one would like to call the international court of justice in the Haag because of crimes against movie theater logic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The film has a deeply human request. </seg>
<seg id="22"> He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still rum run freely and he suspects the Americans and not to operate the Frenchmen (they should times be united here as an exception) the pursuit all too intensively as a result of secret political agreements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> However the well meant and the bad one are sometimes so similar to himself that a famous Brecht poem comes for one into the sense. </seg>
<seg id="24"> .</seg>
<seg id="25"> Films such as "The Hunting party" have exactly such swelling heads which however indicate how exerting it is to be good. </seg>

<seg id="26"> The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkans war film. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Become is reports recently in this newspaper that all Iraq films were Hollywoods large Flops. </seg>
<seg id="28"> One can add: There was never yet as well a good South Africa film. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Is almost always valid: If a cataract is hung around on the crisis ranges or mine fields of the world, then something like that as goes "Rangoon" this out with Patricia Arquette, "beyond of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Possibly, all the conflicts are still too specific simply within a given time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Decades in any case had to pass it before Hollywood with "Schindlers list" was able to shoot a good film via the Holocaust. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Some film will probably still ripen - the Vietnam plants "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal suit coat" considered a classic author now were celebrated seinerzeit of yes by no means einhellig as masterpieces. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> However perhaps we know today where every mass murder in real-time comes two screens to immediately home, also simple too much over the conflicts of the world. </seg>
<seg id="34"> And that robs the Drehbuchschreibern the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs it in order to tell good stories. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Are or nothingness" or "the large dictator" finally therefore as well became yes so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how badly the Nazi regime reigned really. </seg>
