<seg id="1"> Food debt at European inflation</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Principal reason for the rise of the inflation measured in the euro zone are the rapidly rising food prices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the 13 countries of the euro zone the price increase was higher in November than expected - after the 2,6 per cent in October an annual inflation rate was registered by 3.1 per cent, how the statistic office of the European Union in Luxembourg reports.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Official prognoses proceeded from only 3 per cent, announced Bloomberg.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In contrast to the American, British, and Canadian issuing bank the European central bank (EZB) did not lower the Leitzsins. After their discretion the rising rohstoffpreise and the easy decrease of unemployment the emergence of an inflationary spiral would favour the reduction of the rate of interest.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The EZB is anxious, the inflation rate under two per cent to keep at least scarce or at the two-per cent mark.</seg>
<seg id="7"> According to an analyst be the EZB in the dilemma: One must "agree upon" the inflation, in order to exclude later action need.</seg>
<seg id="8"> With 3,3 per cent the inflation rate reached a twelve-yearly record high in November in Germany; in Spain climbed the rate of 3,6 to 4,1 per cent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> For the rise of the inflation in the euro zone the risen food and energy price are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The MATIF Weizennotierungen rose by 88 per cent, and the course for soy beans reached likewise a record high since 1973.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Also with food oil and milk products there was a substantial price increase in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The world price for crude oil rose in this year by 52 per cent - in the past month the cost per barrel of the black gold reached almost 100 US dollar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the EZB the inflation will rise in the year 2008 of 2,1 to 2,5 per cent, however one counts 2009 on a decrease on 1,9 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="14"> For the coming 3-4 months analysts proceed from a 3-Prozent-Inflationsrate, number the annual average rate however with 2,1 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="15"> For 2008 experts count on the fact that the EZB will twice lower the interest.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Gallup locates cabinet crisis</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After long stagnating the number of the Fidesz sympathizers to at the beginning of of Decembers grew substantially. Erstmal since 2002 has the party the largest basis camp, while the agreement for the socialists achieved a tiefpunkt of 13 per cent, dagewesenen ever, according to Gallup.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> With the party-faithful voters the difference precipitates clearly owing to the high determination of the opposition proponents: More than two thirds (71 per cent) face fifth (20 per cent) agreement for the MSZP.</seg>
<seg id="4"> MDF and SZDSZ are according to inquiry under the parliamentary entrance hurdle: They come in the total population on two per cent.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The number of party voters grew in both bearings by a per cent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the comparison to the last tiefpunkt the general economic tendency continued to worsen - the portion of those, which judge the economic situation of the country as "expressed badly", was so high never before (41 per cent), while they regard further 46 per cent "rather bad" as.</seg>
<seg id="7"> After hope-fuller prospects in the spring and summer the families see the change of their financial situation again more pessimistic.</seg>
<seg id="8"> For the coming year the majority of the population counts on a further degradation of the situation; only one tenth proceeds from an improvement.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In December an accomplished Gallup inquiry resulted in the fact that 71% of the asked ones - a historical high - which as "rather badly as quite" judged work of the prime minister.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Thirteen per cent of the asked ones have large confidence or confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the portion of the proponents for Viktor Orbán constitutes 38 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Approximately 54% do not trust the head of the government at all, compared with 27% distrust against the party chief of the Fidesz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> One of the indicators of the political tendency is the number of those, means, one could get the discontent with the Prime Minister also without changes of government into the grasp.</seg>
<seg id="13"> After unrests in past October still if 35% for the whereabouts of the government and the head of the government had expressed themselves, this portion amounts today to only 20%, while the relative majority (33 per cent) sees the solution only in new elections.</seg>
<seg id="14"> For their interest in the popular vote it answered asked 60 per cent that they participate "with security" would deliver, and further 20% their vote "probably".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> To the comparison: if the parliamentary elections would take place on this Sunday, only 55 per cent "with security" to the urns would go, further 15% regard its participation as "probably". In view of these tendencies the result of the popular vote would be foreseeable.</seg>
<seg id="16"> 74% would be correct against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital day money.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Put down on the group at the popular vote "with security" participation became the portions of the opponents of the studies -, practice and hospital fees even of the 81, 84, and/or. 89 per cent amount to.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Auchan most expensively, Tesco increases by nearly a fifth</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Hypermarkets in the Budaoerser commercial area maintained also this yearly the average price increase of 16% from the last year, with the difference that there was this yearly no increase of the value added tax.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Article from Napi Gazdaság</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In the Budaoerser commercial triangle increased the price of the usual Weihnachtskorbes of the "Napi" also this yearly by 16 per cent, however in all hypermarkets price increases were registered of over 1.000 HOOF.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After the prices are "away-galloped" in the food markets in past December, the price increase failed prozentuell not drastically, compared with the anyway high, earlier output level.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However it affects the consumers certainly deterring that that, for which they had paid in the last year still well under 9.000 HOOF is available this yearly not even for 10.000 HOOF.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The price of the "Napi" of warenkorbs exceeded the magic 10.000-HUF-Grenze by at least 91 HOOF in the examined markets.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The highest price amounted to 10,573 HOOF.</seg>
<seg id="9"> (in 6800 the price was with 6.800 HOOF.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The prices for Unicum and alive fish remained almost to previous year level, strongly rose however the prices for Putenbrustfilets, nut and poppy.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data centers of the statistic office of Hungary, with Auchan gave it however to 1kg bread waking for 139 Forint.</seg>
<seg id="12"> There was no competition-conditioned collapse of prices on under 200 Forint with the product.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The price two litres of a Coca Cola pledge bottle of under 200 Forint was likewise surprising, thus cost here the beverage inclusive pledge only 257 HOOF.</seg>
<seg id="14"> This yearly in the "Napi" nevertheless cut most expensively, and Cora to goods basket comparison off Auchan most favorably.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Our computations resulted in that Cora the prices in the "Napi" warenkorb opposite the Weihnachtspreisen in the past year around 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased in each case by 18 per cent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The difference between the cheapest warenkorb of the previous year and the most expensive heurigen yearly amounted to 12%, while the increase between cheapest warenkorb of the past most yearly one and most expensive of the current yearly constituted 21%.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The average price rise amounted to 1,480.00 HOOF.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The average price increase still was in the previous year about 1.206,00 Forint, however the value added tax increase became apparent with the prices to last Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Exactly this procedure met the trade badly: Apparent the department stores could not decide so quite, which price margin them with the individual articles to use to be supposed, since the effects of the price increase were unpredictable on the consumer behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="20"> (if the dealer the peripheral speed of a product badly plans, can he around substantial profits fall in the price margin, according to the traffic intensity arranges themselves.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Mehwertsteuer caused the price increase of the "Napi" of warenkorbes failed in the past year in such a manner radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the difference in prices amounted to with the cheapest basket only 844 Forint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This yearly such extremes were not observed, since the most expensive basket cost more around 1.630,00 Forint, as in the previous year, and even with the cheapest there was a price rise of 1.284,00 Forint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In the comparison of the two last Weihnachtssaisons a catastrophic price increase, the price of the daily consumer items showed up in the hypermarkets in as 20 months around more than 30 per cent less rose.</seg>
<seg id="24"> (this again does not confirm necessarily the data centers of the statistic office of Hungary: With some basic food the statistic office in the period of 12 months determined one more than 30-prozentige price increase.</seg>
<seg id="25"> So in for instance beside flour also with eggs.)</seg>
<seg id="26"> If one throws however a view into the "Napi" to warenkorb, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the already in the previous year expensive product rose even in the worst case around hardly more than 10 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position, than the Eilieferanten - nevertheless they could shift the drastic price increase upon the multis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> In the golden commercial triangle the hypermarkets do not deplore themselves; It is reported constantly by good years.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not look no more on the prices.</seg>
<seg id="30"> From all large quantities are bought, durable food go into pallets over the counters.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Wednesday morning gave it in all three department stores endless queues with the cash, when suddenly the number of the customers exploded.</seg>
<seg id="32"> However by the country a smaller customer frequency is reported, so that many multis deplore themselves with the public opinion analysts, it could not even the planned conversion achieve, not only with food, but also with lasting consumer goods.</seg>

<seg id="1"> In many places at disinfectants one saves</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This year more than thousand infections in hospitals were registered, which were to due to inappropriate handling antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The hygenic conditions in the hospitals, the overflow of the beds, the overload of the personnel - all factors, which are not detrimental to damming the infections straight, so the leading lady doctor of the national epidemiology center.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In many places also with the disinfectants one saves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Traumatologie department of the János of hospital recently an MRSA infection was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient, who was in-supplied after a heavy accident to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The patient was isolated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At the beginning of the yearly there was here already a similar infection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The hurt one of a heavy car accident became from the hospital to dismiss, a little later had the man however with an MRSA infection to return. An important operation could not be accomplished since then because of the bacterium, which is still in the body of the patient, yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Until 10 December of this yearly from hospitals 1094 by multi-resistant exciters released infections were announced to the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system, so the leading lady doctor of the national epidemiology center, Karolina Boeroecz.</seg>
<seg id="11"> So many infections released by multi-resistant exciters were thus registered in the hospitals with security, the dark number might be however higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were released by the MRSA, that against Methicillin Oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries for instance a third of humans in its nose, without it would cause an illness.</seg>
<seg id="14"> SA-CONDITIONED infections (as for instance neck inflammation, almond inflammation, inflammations of the skin or wounds) react usually well to antibiotics, it are well welfarable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> If the means are however too highly proportioned or used inappropriately, antibiotic-resistant from that well respondierenden bacteria, which spread under appropriate conditions in the hospitals fast, develop.</seg>
<seg id="16"> In particular with patients with weakened, or durably badly functioning immune system, in addition, in older, or patients with small body weight these bacteria can cause heavy infections, as for instance for Wundinfektion or blood poisoning, thus Sepsis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The medical director/conductor of the János of hospital according to the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belongs to the patient house everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="18"> One may not confound the infection with the epidemic disease, manhte Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA gives it only not, where she is not looked for.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Resistant to antibiotics</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "such patients are isolated, the maintenance personnel carry rubber gloves and masks with the supply, and we have Tibor Nyulasi the antibiotics" necessary for the treatment - in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Examined during their admission in the hospital will the patients on MRSA, an infection can not be nevertheless always avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Samplings too rarely</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The majority of the infections in hospitals, released by MRSA, would be avoidable, however the at present dominant conditions and circumstances were unfavorable for the containment of the emergence or the propagation of the multi-resistant exciter, say Karolina Boeroecz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> After this infection predominantly occurs in hospitals and old people's homes, the hospitals should examine the in-supplied patients and MRSA infected to isolate immediately.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In the Hungarian hospitals the micro-biological sampling however so frequently one does not practice.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Not least because there are of sides of the national health insurance company no subsidies for this investigation.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Most cases would come therefore only then to the daylight, if the patient has already a noticeable MRSA infection, so the medical chief of the epidemiology center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> In addition, Vonseiten of the European union gives it strict recommendations regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humanmedizin, it gives in Hungary to guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and disease pictures.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Antibiotic therapies should be purposeful, i.e., micro-biological investigations are necessary, so that no resistance can form against the means, however this directive by hospitals are also not always kept.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Under the ambulatory, or itself in the basic supply patient present is micro-biological samplings even still more rarely, like that Karolina Boeroecz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> One saves with the disinfectants</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Scientific proofs prove that MRSA will transfer from a patient to the other one most frequently from the maintenance personnel.</seg>
<seg id="33"> Straight one therefore comes to the hand washing, or carrying gloves and masks a great importance, however there are substantial lack in the hospitals also in this area.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> MRSA will transfer the infected patient by droplet infection or contact, in the domestic hospitals does not exist however always the possibility, to isolate.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The rooms are even often overcrowded, those beds scarcely together gereiht, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from epidemiological view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> How Karolina Boeroecz continues to mark, it seems unfortunately in financially less the hospitals well placed even that with disinfectants is saved, it gives few male nurses, many patients - all to factors, which almost favour the emergence of infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Such infections are there as can be prove far less frequent, and/or can be stopped the further spreading of the exciter, where these preventive measures are kept, so Karolina Boeroecz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Government program against MRSA</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> MRSA infections into the grasp to gotten causes for the health insurances enormous costs, therefore they are everywhere fought.</seg>
<seg id="40"> In England for example the vorbeugung by MRSA, and/or its containment was held in the government program.</seg>
<seg id="41"> After first signs the program is successful - like published data occupy, is declining the tendency of the MRSA infections in England.</seg>
<seg id="42"> The European center for disease prevention (ECDC) the vorbeugung of the emergence of multi-resistant exciters (under it also MRSA), as well as the vorbeugung of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities explained.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The development of the Bulgarian property market is marvelous - completely Europe looks attentively on the in former times rarely mentioned Balkans state.</seg>
<seg id="3"> What, where, and who buys at the still cheapest market of the European Union, which becomes rapidly more expensive however?</seg>
<seg id="4"> An analysis of the Bulgarian RH/MAX of division.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Bulgaria is at present without a doubt most in demand plaster for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with favorable ski apartments and houses at the sea.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Between the mountains the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa count the "gold coast" to the most popular, at the sea are Albena, the "sun coast", and the historical small towns Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, however real estates are approximately in demand for Kavarna and Balcik also ever more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to estimates of RH/MAX analysts in Bulgaria wid also the interior sooner or later investors attract, thus for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also expressed the favorable area of Russian registers more buyer.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The capital Sofia offers likewise enticing offers - handels and office surfaces offer highest net yields.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Bulgaria is to be become on the best way one the most attractive European Golferparadiese to thus attract and apart from the summer and winter season also in the two other seasons tourists.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Foresighted investors buy therefore already now on a large scale, for example approximately around Bansko.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> According to analysts humans, who acquire real estates, strive also a change of their life change in Bulgaria on.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, most buyers are Englishman, it come prospective customers from France, Belgium, Spain, and ever more from Romania.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Investors from Malta and Cyprus are likewise present, while there are predominantly Russian buyers with the black sea and in the skiing areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> There are three groups of foreign buyers, say Georgij Jankov, director of regional von Re/Max Bulgaria.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Those, which want to establish themselves, buy either revitalisierte real estates around 50-100.000 euro, or heruntergekommene houses around 5-15.000 euro, which recondition them then.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Good binding and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are largely written, in addition, the proximity to a large city, business and physicians are crucial for the buyers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> To the second category belong those, which are on the search to a holidays domicile (Bulgaria was listed in December under the Top Ten vacation goals of the Germans).</seg>
<seg id="18"> Businessmen constitute the third group, who invest with the goal of a central to long-term increase in value.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Real estates in the capital meanwhile constantly more expensively, due to the always growing demand.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Within the European Union the real estate prices are in Bulgaria at the lowest, in the past five years gave it however a price increase around annually 21 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Fodor and the six Hungarian per cent</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> How secretary of the environment communicated Gábor Fodor, the expert meetings go on Tuesday to end, and the debate over the international air conditioning after 2012 is continued by the Ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise over the timetable of Bali, in which the emission-reducing measures are fixed for the time after 2012, thus at expiration of Kyoto minutes.</seg>
<seg id="4"> At present a violent debate between industrie and developing countries is under way.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The USA signaled already that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers, however would be ready it to reduce to 2020 the greenhouse gas missions compared with 1990 by 25-40 per cent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The other large question of the conference is to be supported, whether the industrial nations are ready, apart from the reduction of the emissions the developing countries both financially, and technologically.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Also an agreement was obtained over the support by developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="8"> That Kyoto minutes subordinated adjustment funds is to be administered by a 16-koepfigen advice, presumably at the global Umweltfazilitaet (GEF) the UN, as in the "Piac és profit" is to be reread.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Of Hungary six per cent</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Secretary of the environment Gábor Fodor supports the effort of the European Union in the name of Hungary to maintain their role of the pioneer with global climatic preventive measures to obtain and until 2009 a new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Minister explained, who European Union to 2020 by 20% will reduce the greenhouse gas missions (based on the values of 1990), independently of it whether the "agreement is successfully obtained after 2012", or not. The union would be even ready to use itself for a 30-prozentige reduction soferne other large industrial nations of the world, and/or developing countries are likewise ready to follow their obligations after forces and responsibly.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states, which had joined 1997 Kyoto minutes was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, whereas the European Union with their had already committed itself at that time 15 member states to a minus of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The default for Hungary reads reduction of the greenhouse gas missions around 6% compared with the years 1985-87 - a default, which will quite fulfill the country, as is to be reread in the press release of the Department of the Environment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The employment is high on Bali - nevertheless the long-term international climaticpolitical agreement must be finished within two years, otherwise it would only enter into force with security after 2012. In this case no renewed, international emission reduction system would follow the reduction projects specified in Kyoto minutes, whose meaning also the IPCC, which emphasized international scientific climatic change committee of the UN in its recent report, distinguished with the Nobel peace prize.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Thus the emission reduction would retard, and the increase of the average temperature of the earth around more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which would entail extremely serious and irreparable consequences according to Wissenschaftern.</seg>

<seg id="9"> Originally the Air Force has the videos with the goal of recruiting soldiers published, and how the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions serve also the purpose to inform the population about the actual goals of the international missions.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Such kind published propaganda is almost free of charge compared with conventional television commercials, like that defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, however these videos always carry a certain measure of political message in itself, since they confirm the right of existence of the military measures decided by the government in own way.</seg>

<seg id="13"> From the theaters in the Iraq and in Afghanistan already numerous videos turned in the employment were by the way loaded on the platform, this "kind" to have the British however only recently for itself were discovered.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The Americans recruit meanwhile in the something other kind, i.e. with the free of charge downloadable shooting play "America's Army", in which the player can slip in the context of a more or less life-faithful simulation into the skin of the soldier.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Political Capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In opinion of the department for risk analysis (Risk Analysing division) of Political Capital the activities in this August of the Hungarian guard created with support of the "movement for a better Hungary" raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several regard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the "risk warning report" of the institute it means among other things: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk represents the "aggravation of the ethnical tensions already existing between the gypsies and population of non--gypsy in Hungary, who could lead even at short notice to violent ethnical arguments".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Principal reason for it is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, which probably aims at the provocation of such an argument, so Forschungsinstitut.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> How reports, this is regarded as omission on the part of that politically responsible persons: "persons of the public life left the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groupings, which developed now their political strategy on the Rome outer yarn contrast".</seg>
<seg id="6"> One assumes the fact that this intensify the problem, whom makes reasonable dialogue impossible extremities favour, as well as would increase the probability of violent arguments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In addition the Forschungsinsitut means, which would have activities of the Hungarian guard, not least damaged owing to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad substantially, in particular which concerns the confidence in stability and democratic ripe ones".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> We remember: Since autumn is 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary continuously in the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several were based, "national self-defense association" organizations calling.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "these groupings it is common that they in each case define themselves as civilian organization, while they prahlen openly with the fact their members up - every now and then armed - tasks of defense to prepare (disaster control, national defense, order guarding), with reference to the unfitness of the police, the army, and/or the state" it was said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> And further: All this happens in accordance with that method, which tries, different, to camouflage on the policies and Parteiverdrossenheit of the population based, political efforts as civil initiative.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The stress of the civilian character and the association form serve thus not only the evasion of legal hurdles, which could emerge in the course of the entry with court - it is at the same time a political strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> How is to be inferred from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk-increasing factor also for the relations with the neighbour states.</seg>
<seg id="13"> "in the last months the Hungarian guard in several neighbour states was quoted as potenzielle source of danger, so some ultranationalistischer politicians of certain neighboring countries sees in the emergence of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary politics.</seg>
<seg id="14"> All this has effects on the political stability of the region "- it meant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> From the view of the research institute the establishment of the Hungarian guard is not a single phenomenon in central Eastern Europe, thus the political risk for the entire region grew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As reports, the activities of the Hungarian guard are comparable to the Bulgarian national guard, whose establishment was communicated in August 2007 by the right-wing extremist Bulgarian national union (BNU) with those.</seg>
<seg id="17"> In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian guard were located the Rome to eating excesses, which took place in a borough of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BNU took the incidents equal to the cause for the establishment of the national guard, with the argument that the goal of the organization is the "national protection".</seg>
<seg id="19"> According to their opinion a proper "gypsy terror" was in Bulgaria noticeable, the state remained however doless and indifferently - in such a way Political Capital in the past 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And further: The initiative would have kicked loose a violent debate in the Bulgarian public.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> How said, also proven the increased risk for ethnical arguments by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to create for resistance purposes their own guard.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Since activities Hungarian guard so far many similarities with those Bulgarian national guard shows, not to exclude is it that the Hungarian Roma likewise, with which to the threats reacts, is called to organizing its own protection it in the risk warning report of Political Capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Attila Juhász, director of research with Political Capital said on request of the press agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Risk analysis report published, and should is informed annually risk-changing tendencies be recognizable, the public opinion, as in the case by the publication of the risk warning report.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Holidays are not everywhere holidays</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In Hungary holidays are regulated legally exact, so that the practice of making new arrangements the working days was meanwhile established approximately around the holidays, however give to us the coming year less such days.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Also in the European Union and in America one understands something else by "holiday".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Hungarian juridical system differentiates between state holidays and work-free days.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Work-free days are mostly church holidays, or stand with important historical events in connection.</seg>
<seg id="6"> We celebrate New Year for example also: Both the last day of the old, and the first day of the new yearly are work-free days - thereby the latter alone the Silvester celebrating to rest itself can do.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the whole year we have altogether fourteen holidays.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The state holidays are 15 March, which reminds of the revolution of 1848, and which 23 October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On 20 August the establishment of state, on 1 May the work, is celebrated on 1 and 2 November thinks of we our dead ones.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Beyond that there are ever two holidays to Easter, Whitsuntide, and Christmas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Since our state -, national or religious holidays on one weekend fall rarely, the practice of the "working day shift" worked satisfactorily in the cases, in which we would work before or after the holiday only one day.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The price of the extended weekends is however the fact that we very probably work on Saturdays before it or into the school to go must.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be processed finally is specified, since long years by the employment minister in its own regulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The legislation applies to all employers and takers, to public employees and officials of the public service equally.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Excluded are only companies and mechanisms, in which the enterprise without interruption, thus also at the holidays, is continued.</seg>
<seg id="16"> This year working rules is only brought somewhat in disorder by the holidays at the year end: Starting from 24 December the life in this country stops formally, since most for the days between Christmas and Silvester time reconciliation, or which particularly for it waived vacation take.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In the next year fall more holidays into the week center, and/or on the end of the week, so that it will give fewer changes of plans at the working days, than this year.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The calendar is placed first approximately around the day of the work "on the head", so that humans can remain equal four days at the piece at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saturday, which will be 26 April one working day, thereby Friday, 2 May one quiescent day can.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The second change of plans is connected with the holiday on 23 October: On Saturday, which 18 October one will process Friday, 24 October first must.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The end of the yearly will be located however completely in the indication of the holidays, after starting from 24 December everything remains lying and standing, even if Silvester on one Wednesday falls.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Six deterring little things, in order to annoy teammates</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Enamel, which we forget to send, to language messages, which we never receive - harmless lies, which are not noticeable to us any longer: They bring "color" into the everyday life on the job.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The question is bare, whether one gets accustomed to these small incommodities, or places themselves one better to the challenge and tries these misleading to vermweiden for other annoying situations consciously.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Tipps.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Sorry, I has forgets you to align that someone from the marketing department called" - a colleague says.</seg>
<seg id="6"> That one missed thereby a meeting?</seg>
<seg id="7"> One regrets it at best and tries it again to good-close perhaps, by calling at the marketing department and confessing reumuetig, one would have forgotten to align the message (that is the less usual method).</seg>
<seg id="8"> The thing with an apology is dismissed mostly.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Before one involves oneself into embarrassing excuses, one should consider, with which one can to prepare and try its colleague indeed unpleasant moments to avoid these situations consciously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Something lent, which does not belong to one?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> There are hardly something Nervigeres, as if one after a document, office supply, or the telephone seizes, not there but it is.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Yesterday did the booklet equipment still lie on the desk - this morning is it away?</seg>
<seg id="13"> Or lost believed ball-point pens for instance on the desk of a colleague discovered?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Without to ask one should not itself anything of the colleagues check-out counters, because they are by right annoyed, if they state that somewhat got away.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Thus, no covers or post office its from the office into the bag put, because it could meet one: keins more there, if man's nevertheless urgently needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> GET ratchet over the private life of the colleagues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> There is no effective means to stop a gossip, which was already set into the world.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Who with whom, which made?</seg>
<seg id="19"> Where and why?</seg>
<seg id="20"> One should not bind the information (or assumptions) over the private life of the colleagues after possibility for everyone to the nose!</seg>
<seg id="21"> And if someone opens and tells us its internal secret nevertheless, we should not abuse this confidence!</seg>
<seg id="22"> Best one is silent like a grave, instead of aligning straight the not present one, even if others know about the problems of the colleague also.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Without reason ill announced?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If one calls in the office, in order to announce itself with reference to tormenting headache ill, because one feels straight uneasy, or to simply only rest itself, should one would like to realize oneself over one: Now the colleagues must settle the own work, urgent completions, projects with firm dates instead of one.</seg>
<seg id="25"> The colleague thus badly do not along-play!</seg>
<seg id="26"> If one already knows at the vortag that one will not create it on the next day in the office, or that somewhat interfere could, why one must remain at home, should one it in time announce, so that neither the colleagues, still the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Gesumme, Gekicher, telephoning</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> One is deepened straight in its work, by the loud Gekicher of the colleagues is however suddenly disturbed?</seg>
<seg id="29"> Inadvertently a telephone call belongs, which one should not have heard better?</seg>
<seg id="30"> One should not the colleagues with sums, singing, loud discussions (which one leads across its heads away), Getrampel, continuing grumbling or Noergeln nerves.</seg>
<seg id="31"> All this can be disturbing much, even if they are not deepened straight in a task (write, plan, organize).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Is the other debt always?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> If a project is finished not within the prescribed period, one has an important letter or important realigns forgotten to send, should not look for one the debt of the own forgetfulness not with others!</seg>
<seg id="34"> After possibility one should not dissuade oneself from on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!</seg>
<seg id="35"> Best one confesses oneself its to error, and apologizes, if others were affected also by it!</seg>
<seg id="36"> The question, how one good-makes the error again, or which missed retrieve can, is only too appropriate!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In the office - a feeling like at home?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Training trousers and Schlapfen: Comfortably for at home, however in the office nothing lost!</seg>
<seg id="39"> Not even then one should dress so casual, if it would actually permit the job!</seg>
<seg id="40"> Only not too schlampig will - one should respect oneself both its colleagues, and so far that one dresses accordingly in the office - if desired, also prettily and elegantly!</seg>

<seg id="2"> Stop and go-traffic, the car in the middle in the all-morning back-up.</seg>
<seg id="3"> From the radio a strange melody rings out: The sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I turn the volume more highly.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The speed changes, to the past sounds comes the bass, and as genuine sound jewel a female choir.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It is the song "Wings OF Love" from Zagar, which rings out on mr2.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The domestic music scene does not have us long time straight delicately with qualitative Electropop.</seg>
<seg id="8"> But one sees even the back-up now differently, if one hears thereby the new album of Zagar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the domestic digital Underground scene contribute slowly to a change of the overall view, and even if the garage skirt with its Gitarrengequit again "in" is, to which domestic Electropop proves: There is new under the sun.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Balázs Zságer began in Pécs, made music even in the volumes Yonderboi, before he - perhaps, because a pub does not stand two Pfeifer - its own way to walk on began.</seg>
<seg id="11"> It created the break-through with its project (Zagar) and its music, which merge elements from jazz, electronics, and Pop, however only as one with the request to compose the sound TRACK to a film to him had come closer (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="12"> "Szezon" of Ferenc Toeroek).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The formation, which had arisen at first in smaller clubs, became known to the broader public only, than the magazine "wan2" lined its first album up from the year 2002 under the Top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, kuerte to the almost only, also trendsetter marketable in the west.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Without a doubt Zagar were and its volume "trendy", it interested however none whether they carried this mark also gladly.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The volume reacted, as it should: With a new, still better album.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The new album with the title "CAN emergency, appeared now, mill Fly Instead" could to them new ways open, however the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The expression comes of to the time, when Balázs Zságer was still with another volume on the way.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The airy, flying allusion would be also correct, however the influences of the Rock'n'Roll are noticeable apart from the ethereal character of the music - the spirit of the time and the trend appropriate - the louder guitar.</seg>
<seg id="19"> With these songs in England living and with that volume "The puzzle" thought of working singers Gyoergy Ligeti with the premiere in the Millenáris.</seg>
<seg id="20"> A song of the album it even to the radio hit created - which has sending mr2 Pet?fi since newest one from early to late Popmusik the listeners with the number "Wings OF Love", which was taken up under co-operation by six domestic singers ("Underground Divas"), gradually the ear worm set.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Everything in order thus (?).</seg>
<seg id="22"> Hvg.hu with Balázs Zságer inquired.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent does your music of a certain layer remain reserving?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" does not mean me straight much.</seg>
<seg id="25"> According to my opinion there is two box in the Popmusik, not Mainstream and Underground, or alternative and Pop, but commercial and honestly.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Even the so-called alternative or Underground music can be shallowly and insignificant, exactly the same can it in addition, only for the sales be produced, which makes it commercial music.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Also a good Pop number can develop from an honest motive.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The acceptance of the listener functions also according to this principle, from languages and national borders independently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> hvg.hu: Do you face with a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign public your music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> B. Zs.: Abroad, in particular west of us the Popmusik has a larger tradition.</seg>
<seg id="31"> There goes not only dte rodent or Twens on concerts, but also the older public.</seg>
<seg id="32"> They pursue the trends in the Popmusik, which happen around them, many more attentively, because they regard them also as a part of the contemporary culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> hvg.hu: Which role comes the public too with your work?</seg>
<seg id="34"> Is it important, who, where, how many hears your music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> B. Zs.: It is natural a good feeling to see that ever more come to our concerts.</seg>
<seg id="36"> We however never composed for the market.</seg>
<seg id="37"> With us the music does not develop, in order to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The role of the public is mostly noticeable with the concerts, where there is already a mutual reciprocal effect, but it gives again only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment.</seg>
<seg id="39"> One were noticeable to me nevertheless: If you want to make it quite for all, you are no longer interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?</seg>
<seg id="41"> It is as soloist on the way and its career rather in the west developed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> B. Zs.: We do not go really its way, times of the fact completely apart that one tries again and again to in-interpret this into our music.</seg>
<seg id="43"> We see ourselves rather as Teamplayer, which can trust on the musical operational readiness level of the other one and be unfolded them.</seg>
<seg id="44"> At first were naturally comparisons of our work with from Yonderboi inevitable, since several from us its volumes come and hit another way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> hvg.hu: In the Charts of mr2 Pet?fi stands for "Wings OF Love" in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="46"> Many heard the name Zagar only in connection with this number.</seg>
<seg id="47"> Was the opening with a somewhat more popular style consciously produced toward a broader public?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> B. Zs.: We did not have plans to write a hit which was to then hold as a course horse for the album.</seg>
<seg id="49"> In this song it concerns more.</seg>
<seg id="50"> It was meant as final of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the Klangorgie and the somewhat more difficult topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?</seg>
<seg id="52"> Why straight it, which was the guidance principle?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a Gospel well-behaved choir.</seg>
<seg id="54"> Then the idea came to arrange the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene.</seg>
<seg id="55"> Thus did the sechskoepfige choir develop - thus for Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik? Hodosi [ Neo ], Juci Németh -, which we baptized then more apaeter "Underground Divas".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song exactly the same, or it the girls codesigned?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> B. Zs.: The number gave it already longer in the instrument valley version, but than the material for the album was finished, we imagined that this number needs still "something".</seg>
<seg id="58"> The chord succession required formally for a singing voice.</seg>
<seg id="59"> I in-sang the melody still at the same night, learned later her the girls.</seg>
<seg id="60"> It came everything practically at first attempt and frightening spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="61"> I can remember, I was at that time rather electrified, but already also the "Divas" required.</seg>
<seg id="62"> With my voice alone the song would have become never so strong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> hvg.hu: Both on the plate, and with the concert one had however the impression, the girls would be in the background.</seg>
<seg id="64"> There is no solo part (apart from the short solo one from Judy Jay), it has no own role, sings perfectly together and is not not louder, than the music, therefore its singing of the music only not accompanied.</seg>
<seg id="65"> Also on the stage they stood in the back.</seg>
<seg id="66"> Is it intention?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67"> B.Zs.: The fact that they are confessed in the back was because of purely technical problems like that.</seg>
<seg id="68"> However we wanted them consciously to give no solo roles.</seg>
<seg id="69"> In the number it goes also forgetting therefore that one is to forget its Ego a little, who from where come and where on the way is, we permit simply that us these certain wings, which raise wings of the love.</seg>
<seg id="70"> I would like that also different feel this euphoric condition, which we felt, when the song developed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> hvg.hu: Which was the most complex song?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> B. Zs.: With the musical work work actually none, it gave more difficult tasks rather when mixing.</seg>
<seg id="73"> For example with "Dorian Gray's dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or with "Rock'n'Roll Goes ton of The Girls", where the Groove did not want to function longer, but gradually joined itself everything, as with a puzzle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> hvg.hu: Which is your favourite number of the new album?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75"> B. Zs.: Changes with the concerts constantly and still, where I the album "losgelasssen" has.</seg>
<seg id="76"> At present there is "prophet Is A Fool", "escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The same".</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An industrial tribunal in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year-old detention for the former president Arnold Alemán on Thursday, to which it had been condemned 2003 because of finance fraud at a value of 100 million dollar (almost 1.8 billion crowns).</seg>
<seg id="3"> However it was later from the prison dismisses and lived under house arrest on its Hazienda with the nicaruanischen metropolis.</seg>

<seg id="7"> These companies were fictitious and the accounts belonged in reality to its related and closest trailers.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Budget is through</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, it is created.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The national budget is approved of.</seg>
<seg id="4"> What is special at this household?</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is the first household, which this government sketched, and which without support of the opposition by the coalition majority one accepted.</seg>
<seg id="6"> For the current year still with support of the?SSD (Social Democrats) one approved of, because it Minister Sobotka (of this party) had submitted, and which could not take the liberty?SSD it therefore to reject him.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In contrast to the lively debate before the tuning over the motion of no confidence against the government this time nothing dramatic happened.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Lower House approved of this traditionally little considered, nevertheless most important law in all peace.</seg>
<seg id="9"> That is to a certain extent paradoxical.</seg>
<seg id="10"> All governing begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the household whether pleases or not.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The household is a substantial component of the policy, however covered by the struggle for power of the government and the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="12"> That is for the media a more grateful topic, and therefore they dedicate more attention to him.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A controversy among politicians is many more interesting for the public than sober numbers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The national budgets suffered at the past social-democratic governments under three weak points, which the household can eliminate for the year 2008 not at one time:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> First is the high portion of expenditures, which are because of obligating of law, whereby it does not only concern the pensions, but also around social expenditures, which the "tacit" coalition of?SSD and KS?M (communist) decided in the last year before the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Second is the defizitaere budgetary policy as consequence of the first weak point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The third restriction exists in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budgetary deficits of the municipalities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The largest risk is not however the national budgetary deficit.</seg>
<seg id="19"> This household is public and eingermassen under control.</seg>
<seg id="20"> A true time bomb is however the budgetary deficit of the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Many mayors spent, in order to open except incomes from taxes, deliveries and bank credits further sources on investments, often inconsiderately debenture bonds, by which they were to blame for their city halls in the oversize.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In the last years it succeeded to them, these debts by massive sales of shares of the energy and of different supply networks, which had received it in the course of the privatisation from the state to pay off.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Now is this source already triumphs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we state that:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> our economics already for some years, how the remainder of the world goes through, a growth phase, whose the?SSD without omit yourself praises.</seg>
<seg id="26"> That represented a unique possibility for its governments of bringing public finances in order.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Instead these governments were to blame for the state however still more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, kept house many more reasonably than our republic.</seg>
<seg id="29"> That is a giant dishonor, which is to be attributed predominantly to the former governments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> We belong to the countries, those, in the global yardstick seen, to few by poverty are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Therefore no nassiven social programs are necessary, which redundant-proves unfortunately straight completely in the last years in gigantic extent was blown up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Even if succeeded, a part of the unreasonable populist expenditures, which were adopted this year before the elections, to paint, is clearly that if it does not come in next time to a shift of the pension entrance age and to a pension reform will remain, then ends practically any politics in this country, and, equal to who in power is whole, for it nothing as pure administration.</seg>
<seg id="33"> It is only easily exaggerated, if one says that then from dominant politicians officials become, who divide the largest part of the tax receipts mechanically on pensions and social expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="34"> Therefore the household of this year can no revolution be, but can only to the displacement of normal expenditures by expenditures for obligation stop order.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The deficit of 70 billion crowns, planned for 2008, would be quite redundant, if former governments had not spent in the last ten years, which only went.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If we do not want that it comes really to the fact that from dominant politicians pure civil servants become, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, that is aware however of its that the state can spend only so much, as it is at taxes and fees to take able peace during the preparation of further reform laws to wish.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Only these make possible a gradual penetration of a balanced national budget.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to Klaus not only the structure of the conference is inakzeptabel, which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such from non-government organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the Rhetorik, which accompanies it, and which reality.</seg>
<seg id="7"> "the debate is unstructured there, it is word fireworks, only replacement is for a real solution of present problems," said Klaus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Czech president stressed with the conception of his book that its topic for him was very important, and that it for it therefore engage itself in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="9"> It expressed also its satisfaction over the fact that its book in German translation appears, because "I often meet on caricatures of my opinions."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Test Peugeot 207 SW 1,6 VTi: Voruteile shrink</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In order to say the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Its handling characteristics were not much worth, the quality of the gear shift, the steering element and also the processing could one as rather designate below average.</seg>
<seg id="4"> But its successor, the Peugeot 207, is now on the market, and that is better around much.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The combination with the designation SW is still another piece further, and for me remains only to revise my opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When I had tested the classical Hatchback 207, I had to deplore myself for example over the too small head liberty on the rear seats.</seg>
<seg id="7"> There are not these complaints now any longer, because the body combination is in such a way arranged that two-meter men will not even suffer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Fast further</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> I go through the interior equipment only briefly, in order not to repeat me too much.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Concerns a Design quite succeeded, where I have objections only because of the miserable frame tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="11"> There I would welcome somewhat more designerische organization, where the car makes otherwise a so elegant impression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The seats are comfortable, and past are the times, where we possibly weighted about to short seats or head restraints.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Also the side stop improved opposite that 206 substantially.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Which concerns the space offer, one can feel the increased dimensions of the body also here.</seg>
<seg id="15"> In the combination also the lack of head liberty, already mentioned, is eliminated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Suit-case into the trunk</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The main thing at this car is however the loading space.</seg>
<seg id="18"> I (also because of the opening by hinges rueckfensters) must call that very good loadable and space-saving.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The cavities are equipped with straps, which represent an ideal compromise.</seg>
<seg id="20"> They disturb not, can be pulled apart and held also heavier articles firmly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we converse about the load volume.</seg>
<seg id="22"> It amounts to according to table in the basic equipment 428 litres, which in the comparison to the competition a rather average value is.</seg>
<seg id="23"> However not in the comparison to the vehicle of this class?koda the Fabia combi usually-sold in Tschechien.</seg>
<seg id="24"> If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we state that the Peugeot stays around clearly noticeable 52 litres.</seg>
<seg id="25"> For one foreign vacation or when inviting a buggy this value is already critical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But around the Positiva to emphasize, I must mention still the loading space completely flat after turning the rear seats down or also the very low ladekante.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> 120 HP in four rows</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with capacity of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 KW.</seg>
<seg id="29"> And honestly said, then a 1600-Kubik-Motor should look, which propels a family Hatchback.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It is quiet, has a small consumption and moves away well.</seg>
<seg id="31"> If I compare it with its counterpart with?koda, which sometimes works, as if its exhaust with a rag would be clogged, then I can be only inspired by it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The price list speaks volumes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The price of this car is not popular straight.</seg>
<seg id="34"> We must remember however that we tested a well equipped car with a roomy Innneren and a very good engine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> The basic price of the car with the 1400er petrol engine at a value of 329900 crowns still concerns.</seg>
<seg id="36"> With our engine it costs starting from 410900 crowns, which already quite much is.</seg>
<seg id="37"> The equipment Premium of the test car strikes again with 80000 crowns additionally to beech.</seg>
<seg id="38"> We had however Kopfairbags, automatic air conditioning system, automatic windshield wiper release, electrical window lifters in the back and and...</seg>
<seg id="39"> Thus the car costs altogether smooths 531900 crowns.</seg>
<seg id="40"> That is a quantity, but sums up you once the zusatzausstattung of a Fabia and you with a completely similar sum will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="41"> Thus remains only the decision, which mark one wants to select.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Only on an island you find however still much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the large Antilleses.</seg>
<seg id="9"> At present the Spaniard was Cuba their bastion for conquest America.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Kolumbus called it the most beautiful place, which one human eye each saw.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Havanna became once a camp or a transit camp of treasures, which had robbed the Spaniards in America and then to Europe transported.</seg>
<seg id="12"> And then the American epoch came.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The hotel Nacional originated in completely at the end 20. Century.</seg>
<seg id="14"> To build it left to one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that applied in the USA as crime (particularly during the prohibition), became on Cuba gladly seen and supports - drugs, gambling, prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Among its guests were among other things.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, franc Sinatra.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In Havanna multistoried buildings grew, over the broad boulevards drove cars, which ranked among the cult symbols of the fifties of the past Jahrhundets.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Ernest Hemingway bought a messuage in San Francisco de Paula, in whom proximity of Havannas, and in Cojímar he had his yacht to lie.</seg>
<seg id="19"> At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio star of the show Business and politician out completely their signatures left America.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> And today?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> At the walls of the Bodeguita of Havanna also you can leave your autograph.</seg>
<seg id="22"> At the bar in the hotel Nacional one mixes cocktails completely for you according to desire.</seg>
<seg id="23"> And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havanna until today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiat in salty and damp air fell apart already long.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Havanna, in particular its oldest part, may not have strongly heruntergekommen, anywhere finds one in the periphery as many marvelous colonial objects of interest here as straight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Other places are out-deseamed straight, for example Trinidad.</seg>
<seg id="26"> In view to it that the tourism brings urgently needed money, it gave it for this development green light.</seg>
<seg id="27"> In the last fifteen years not only in Havanna new hotels developed, but also in Varadero, at the coast of the province Holguín and also on Inselchen such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and other one.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Cuba offers still another Marotte, which is singular in the world and tightens above all railway lover.</seg>

<seg id="33"> So one does not have to write over Varadero or Havanna any longer in detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> It remains mentioning only that in already the mentioned is messuage Hemingways a museum, whose attendance should not to be able to be escaped that, which likes this writer.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most pictorial angles of Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="36"> The sumptuous vegetation grows on lime soil.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The Mogotas, lime hill and rock, rise steeply from the valley soil, in its cavities accumulated fruitful soil, by which rock ranges also weathered are covered by close vegetation.</seg>
<seg id="38"> This valley is it, where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is cultivated.</seg>
<seg id="39"> In its end form you can meet it, if you visit one of the cigar factories of Havanna.</seg>
<seg id="40"> Possibly it appears some also interesting that the Chilean consequence of the TV serial "major Zeman" was turned there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Trinidad</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> An age-old city, which was created briefly, after the Spaniards had colonized the island.</seg>
<seg id="43"> Fame and wealth brought you the trade with slaves and sugars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> The wealth embodied itself in decorations the beauty of the small city.</seg>
<seg id="45"> Spanish colonial architecture, strongly affected by the later French settlers, hardly changed for four hundred years.</seg>
<seg id="46"> Trinidad, between which sea and the Escambray mountains convenient, is a so remote place that there was no road, which would have connected the area with the remaining country there still in the fifties of the last century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unconsidered.</seg>
<seg id="48"> Nothing was built, but therefore also nothing torn off, for everyone was glad there that he had a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="49"> If one has more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worthwhile itself to regard interesting places in the environment as for instance the beach Playa Ancón or the "valley of the sugar factories".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> In the evening one should go then into the Casa de la Música, which animates itself after the darkness, and where the music is not silent up to the morning.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> According to indication of her lawyer the British teacher, who had been accused in the Sudan of offense of the Islam, was condemned on Thursday evening by a court in Khartum to 15 days detention and following classification.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Britin was accused of six to seven-year-old pupils to have permitted to give to a teddybaeren the name Mahomet although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="4"> She would have earned it to be expenditure-whipped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> After parents of pupils had weighted several times at the Sudanese ministry for education and cultural, the 54-jaehrige basic lady teacher, who was active to the Unity High School of Khartum, was at home taken up on Sunday with itself and accused of according to the article 125 of the Sudanese penal code of the offense of the Islam.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> This affair actually takes its beginning in September, when the teacher requests her six to seven-year-old pupil to select a name for the class teddy.</seg>
<seg id="7"> "the children suggest to Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed" eight names, among them, report head master Robert Boules.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Finally, when the class co-ordinates, 20 from 23 children Mohammed select as dearest first names.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a first name very frequent in the Sudan.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Subsequently, the children provided a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and to the caption "my name are Mohammed".</seg>
<seg id="11"> The bear did not carry a sign with this name, but the problem is completely simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as offense of the Islam.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> One of the moslemischen colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, which informs at the same school in the Sudan, explained, he knew her well, and she would have never something would have done, with which she could step too close to a religious faith, "I regrets that she asked the children, for a name to only be correct", its judgement concerns it here only a "innocent error".</seg>
<seg id="13"> An opinion, which numerous pupils of the teacher divide, the this as "very attentively opposite their pupils" and as a "person, who never speaks in the class about religion" describes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> One considers that the first name Mohammed is simultaneous also the secondary name given in Great Britain at the secondly most frequent, for which in English 14 different ways of writing exists.</seg>
<seg id="15"> This of moslemischen families selected first name is often considered as a kind Ehrerbietung at the prophets (it is given frequently to the Erstgeborenen of a family).</seg>
<seg id="16"> But how the rules in the reference to the use of this first name read?</seg>
<seg id="17"> May one give it for example to a toy?</seg>

<seg id="3"> _ a dare door, which due to its duration, which distance of habitable module, which speed, with which he organize, and which of the astronaut "tinker" tools, in order the repair accomplish, several record obtain have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The problem arose on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindric part, which was to take up soon the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This module is a kind jetty for the module laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="6"> But one must be able to supply it with river.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The second task of the crew was it thus to convert 17.5 tons a heavy module for generation of current over solar collectors, which already on EAT YOURSELF found, in order to bring it into its final position.</seg>
<seg id="8"> After it had shifted it, the crew made itself to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module, whose span amounts to 76 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be unfolded like Akkordeone was damaged by a gotten jammed cable on a length by approximately a meter</seg>
<seg id="10"> The restructuring was stopped, in order not to damage the collector still more.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The astronauts, who should repair the space shuttle Discovery originally for a kontrollgang abandoned and then another solar collector, whose rotation system was incorrect, saw themselves forced to dedicate itself to the damaged collector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk at the end of the 30 meters long remote controlled arm of the space shuttle, which at that the station one had attached, around in order the repair to accomplish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> It is one the best "Spacewalker" (Wetraumgaenger) of NASA.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Largely, resistantly, very skillfully, he has a well developed torso and long arms.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The 46-jaehirige learned physician was thus selected, whom "hurt" solar collector "operate".</seg>
<seg id="16"> After it had examined the damage exactly, it split the incorrect cable and fastened a kind rails on the damaged place.</seg>
<seg id="17"> It was supported by a second "Spacewalker", which remained in the proximity of the air-lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, Kommandantin of the crew.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The tool, which it used, a mini hockey stick, with insulator tapes, in order to prevent on the solar collectors, which produce several hundred V, an electrical impact, had the astronauts on board the station devised and "tinkered".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> When the action was terminated, Scott Parazynski waited, until the collector was completely unfolded, before it counted and into the station back turned its tools.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Yesterday the astronauts enjoyed afternoon a half day relaxation, before today seven astronauts turned Discovery on the space shuttle back, in order to presumably begin Wednesday the return flight to the earth.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> - who will begin PUT in follow-up as a president?</seg>
<seg id="15"> The office newspaper communicated the date of the first ballot of the presidency elections yesterday, 2 March 2008; the candidates have time until 23 December to make itself well-known.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Since he was selected 2000 and 2004 were red-elect, Vladimir Putin cannot begin for a third mandate in consequence.</seg>

<seg id="2"> With scarcely five weeks up to the end-of-year procedure at the stock exchange the investors already rub regarding the coming Endjahres Rally the hands.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Nevertheless the experts can provide in this connection no safe prognoses.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Banif believes that "purely statistically regards, the month Decembers at the stock exchange normally with a positive market tendency accompanies</seg>
<seg id="5"> Nothing the defiance is not advisable it to provide prognoses at short notice and only on the basis from statistics to. Above all not if tensions which can be taken seriously determine the current market happening</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Although other experts do not approve such an strong improvement in prices in the last weeks of the yearly, these mark nevertheless that "the market prices of given the liquidity of the market and the market participant is determined. These invest due to the lack of safe share funds mainly in pension fund, which is strongly concerned by the revaluation-running trend to productive net assets.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Therefore according to opinion of these experts the stock exchange rather a rather lateral, from market fluctuations affected course trend to exhibit, "above all because we yet the extents of the possible decrease of the interest rate of the US issuing bank to measure be able, an uncertainty particularly to the risen crude oil price and the danger of the rise of the inflation rate due is not."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department with.bpi in Spain, agrees with the fact that it is a daring time to announce a forthcoming market Rally.</seg>
<seg id="9"> "the chances stand not very well", insure the expert.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Spanish share index Ibex already lost a value of 4 % since its maximum mark on 8 November of 15.945,7 points.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But all experts do not divide the same negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In the opinion of Juan Solana, analyst with Intermoney, could lock the Ibex 35 due to the restructuring of the unit trust fund and the traditional, each year at this time made Bezuschussung of the pension scheme, the year successfully with nearly 16,000 points.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The expert emphasizes nevertheless that this year the things somewhat differently develop could; particularly due to already in the second December week, and therefore directly after the bridge day for the day of the condition, taking place Endjahres Rally.</seg>
<seg id="14"> In opinion of the analyst the price fluctuations would not affect the markttendenzen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> According to estimate of Federico Olucha, analyst with the bank Inversis, find the past evaluations to the market situation on an almost technical level, which could lead to it, "that shortly a deviation from the index values appear could, their extents depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The analyst trusts in the fact that these positively fail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> With the selection of the values, which are to advance the Ibex to new maxima, are itself the analysts united.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Solana of Intermoney protests that "this year the large values at the row are."</seg>
<seg id="19"> Among the value winners the expert would rank the two major banks and some real estate companies, would be to expensive there "the current sector to the given time."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Meanwhile Federico Olucha of the bank Inversis insures that the rises in connection will accompany with the bank and industrial sector.</seg>
<seg id="21"> If the Rally actually occurs, the real estate companies will profit from it.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutes from on Mondays to on Fridays 12 hours on the day.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Popular decided to modernize a large part of its branches.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Altogether 200 of it is settled in the most economiceconomics regions of Spain.</seg>
<seg id="4"> For Institut, who operates under the label name Popular max, these addresses mean a large milestone.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In addition, for the remaining Spanish institutes, since Popular represents as a first bankers' syndicate the jump dares to extend and Saturday of 10h to 20.30h set the opening times of its branches of weekday to 20.30h.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The bankers' syndicate BBVA, which is likewise reported the extension of their opening times in the addresses repeated reads, seized so far still no definite resolution.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The to time current negotiations of the bank with the trade unions seem an agreement to aim at, with which 75% of all branches of Saturday are closed and but at a weekday to open in the afternoon, if also not for customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Whether further banks of the new initiative follow will depend, which adapts to the business opening times, on the empirical values of the Popular bank.</seg>
<seg id="9"> And straight that is also the intention, which pursues Popular with its project.</seg>
<seg id="10"> A goal is it to extend the opening times of those branches those due to its layer purchase-merry customers of independent, small and centralconstant enterprises, in addition, those of large department stores to seize can.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The bank would like to open the new 200 branches in the course of the coming 18 months, there it around new, but changed opening times does not act.</seg>
<seg id="12"> But the bank will transform the premises of those addresses, which already are in business zones, and them at the same time the individual customer profile of the different zones to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Thus the extension of the opening times is connected with a new spatial arrangement of the branches, which is characterised by a more current, farbenfroheres Design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera insures the fact that the restructuring does not require larger investments, but with a increased personnel attitude, there a branch would accompany now no longer six, but eight or nine employees needed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The addresses, which will be equipped even with the additional premises for the KMU, will sell no financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A positive experience for the group</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Popular already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.</seg>
<seg id="18"> And the empirical values failed positively, so Ángel Rivero.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The addresses of the roads Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and the Gran Vía were selected for it which an intelligent resolution seems to have been.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Popular leads momentarily approx.. 2500 addresses.</seg>
<seg id="21"> And further 60, which operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and exhibit likewise extended opening times, even at sunning and holidays.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In these branches of PopularMax the model of the BBVA is not used, since most of them instead for the sales will offer a broad selection of non--financial services.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The Spanish private station Telecinco doubles for the first time its stock exchange value and overhauls thus its rival Antena 3.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> "we created it."</seg>
<seg id="3"> With this sentence the managing director of Telecinco, with stock exchange conclusion gave his satisfaction to Paolo Vasile kund. The transmitter led by it had increased its value by double its rival the Antena 3.</seg>
<seg id="4"> An aspect however absorbed its joy: "that is exactly which me is hurt; not that we a higher growth, but that we had smaller losses ", determined it.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It stressed that they did not sink despite the weak market "too deeply."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Telecinco terminated yesterday the day with a plus of 2,54%.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This profit reduces its past losses of this year on 15,66%.</seg>
<seg id="8"> According to data of Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4,488.88 million euro now, whereby Mediaset controls the principal part of the capital (52 %), and Vocento only with 13% is involved.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The rival Antena 3 lost yesterday 1.52 per cent points and has since January a loss of altogether 40.5% to announce, so that its market value with 2,193.46 million amounts to half.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The market value of other quoted communication enterprises however rises; in the case of Sogecable on 3,571 million, with Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) on 2,518.53 million and with Vocento on 1,779 million.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it concerns "two similar enterprises", so Vasile.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Still the question, in which we can act to extent actually stock exchange-technically, appears uncertain to which price and as we it on customer level to be arranged lucrative can.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Telecinco explained one week ago its project to ascend this year to the first television station with more than 1000 million gross profits from incomes from advertising. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising enterprise of the group.</seg>
<seg id="14"> If the project should be converted, the transmitter would increase its advertising income compared with the 965.4 million from the previous year by 3,6%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In the case of Antena 3 the net turnover rose around 1,6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while the net income from the television business could exhibit only a rise of 0,7% (630.4 million).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The analysts see the main factor for the stock exchange process of Telecinco, better in the comparison, with the high Payout Ratio, which the company could exhibit up to the current time: 2006 arranged the enterprise a 100 percent declaration of dividend led by Alejandro Echevarría.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Vasile insures however that the Ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of the portions of end mol, with Mediaset as parent company, nor, even if it is still too early for an official publication.</seg>
<seg id="18"> "we are committed to the official compromise to disburse at least 50% of the portions even if we indicated so far always substantially more.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stocks we could already increase by the purchase of 33% of the end mol portions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> According to statement of the analysts the market to time exhibits certain loss tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Lehmann Brothers reduced only recently its profit calculation with Telecinco for this year by 4% and for 2009 by 7%.</seg>
<seg id="22"> This is the result of shortening the prospective growth rate, which will decrease/go back 2008 of 10,5% to 8,4% and 2009 of 5,5% to 5,1%.</seg>
<seg id="23"> This lowered also the prospective calculation of profits of Antena 3 for 2008 around 4,5% and for 2009 around 7,5%.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Which insurance is suitable for me best?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The KFZ insurance, which takes one off of the driver caused possible case of loss, contains a high cost, whose height depends wiederrum on different factors, among other things from age, sex, time of the production of the driving licence, family status, kind of the car which can be insured and its use, etc..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A car to possess is only the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Because even more with difficulty the suitable KFZ insurance is to be found than the correct vehicle model.</seg>
<seg id="5"> First of all it must be clear one with which we have to do it here.</seg>
<seg id="6"> An autoinsurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This agreement is held in writing by means of an insurance contract, which specifies the fact that the society receives the agreed upon insurance premium and is in response obligated to submit with a case of loss the appropriate sum paid in compensation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The insurance premium is the price of an insurance, for which by several factors builds itself up, among other things. Older, sex, time of the production of the driving licence, family status, kind of the vehicle which can be insured or its use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The insurance companies determine their prices according to the statistics, so that with a higher danger of accident also higher payments of dues become due.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> For this reason both over 25-year old and women fewer payments of dues carry out, because statistics must prove that these groups exhibit a smaller accident rate owing to their caution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The same applies also to married persons, there these according to statement of the statistic values and therefore also after conviction of the enterprises, to fewer accidents bends like unmarried ones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The use, which is attached to the vehicle, impairs the frequency of driving and concomitantly the probability of an accident.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The more frequently the use, the more probably the damage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> With the list of the premium the insurance must consider a whole set of points.</seg>
<seg id="15"> For this reason also the driver must study the situation thoroughly, in order to select exactly the autoinsurance, which comes to meet its personal needs earliest.</seg>
<seg id="16"> We do not only list the most important points, which one should consider with the selection of an insurance here now, in order one achievement -, to be able to meet but also an price-oriented choice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Under 25-year old meet with the choice of a low-priced insurance numerous obstacles, e.g. the small driving experience and the "young" driving licence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Even if it were best for an ideal insurance protection to lock an insurance against all risks there are nevertheless more inexpensive alternatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The careful drivers can select insurance against all risks with self participation, so that the achievements of an insurance against all risks are covered, but offered for a low price.</seg>
<seg id="20"> This kind of contract contains that the customer must pay a part of the amount resulted from the damage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> "the amount is specified before conclusion of the contract and on the basis the height of the insurance premium. This is more highly the smaller the sum which can be paid ", explains Luis Noguera, general agent of Spain with roofridge Europe, a switching enterprise for on-line insurance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damages, not however against the damages developed at the own car.</seg>
<seg id="23"> In addition this kind of the insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Here an advice.</seg>
<seg id="25"> If you are old under 25 years, it lies in your hand to lower the cost of insurance; thus your credit note increases, by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> A credit note is a lowering of the basis tariff with the appropriate insurance company.</seg>
<seg id="27"> In the opposite in addition contain a punishing payment a rise of mentioned tariff.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "the height of credit notes and punishing payments depend their yields on the society and.</seg>
<seg id="29"> If the enterprise has a yield-rich year behind itself, it can take the liberty to increase the bonus payments ", describes Noguera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> As soon as the 25-Jahre-Marke is exceeded, it is to be locked for the drivers more simply a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving experience the accident rate sinks.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Thus it is most meaningful to decide for an insurance against all risks with self participation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> "normally the young people can draw no use from their past experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of driving not", describe the Spanish chiefs of the European enterprise, and add that the majority of the accidents in the second practice practice occur, after the "fear of the beginner" was put down.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> It is more advisable nevertheless at a married customer, who does not possess children, to lock an insurance against all risks; naturally then only if it also permits the financial situation of the appropriate person.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> On the part of the insurers married couples with children apply as the customers with the smallest accident rate, and accordingly low also its payments of dues fail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> In this case an insurance against all risks with self participation (with an amount around the 300 euro) would be the best option. In the case that one received a high credit note, is recommended an extended insurance, which begins only to the third vehicle year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> "you drive altogether more relaxed and possess a larger purchasing power, which permits it to them, a higher payment of dues to set", determine Luis Noguera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> For pensioners it offers itself, an insurance against all risks with self participation (with an amount around the 150 euro), to lock or an extended insurance which begins only with a sufficiently high credit note.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Finally one must note that the autoinsurance is somewhat very important, not only, because she protects the driver from possible accident damages, but also, because she saves high costs, which require it that a thorough selection is met, which corresponds to our personal situation.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Memo Romey said, it did not keep it worthy a presidency candidate by a schneemann to be asked.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Nevertheless the republican explained itself candidate for the presidency in the long run ready to place itself to a debate on YouTube in which normal voters questions on video accepts and submits, in order it the candidate to send.</seg>
<seg id="4"> None questions, which were at the Wednesday evening, which 28 November, were raised, as ridiculously as the schneemann, which asked democrats over the global heating up in the YouTube debate of the other party.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But the questions, and the answers, reflected this mark exactly the condition of the republican party, which breaks open into the elections in the next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It is not well-known, exactly like the producers of CNN, which every now and then-supported the debate, which to YouTube showing tie-clips selected the beginning candidate.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However in the first half hour of the debate, which was dedicated longest to an individual topic, immigration stood in the center.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The topic is one of the most powerful topics for republicans.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The CNN asked a group of undecided voters a dial to serve, if they heard things, which pleased them: The TV organization noticed points of the agreement as the candidates strictly about the borders spoke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national outrider, and Romney, which pushed themselves forward in the crucial inquiries in Iowa and New Hampshire.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Giuliani tries to shake the call off, it regarding illegal immigration was flexible, when he was a mayor of New York.</seg>
<seg id="12"> It attacked Romney in which it the former governor von Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for work on its house to have adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The two argued particularly violently as interrogators asked whether one of the candidates would support a "amnesty" (would give the illegal ones a regular status and the possibility on the nationality).</seg>
<seg id="14"> Unbedeutendere candidate such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressional representative, and Tom Tancredo, a congressional representative from Colorado, succeeded to after-hook it with this topic.</seg>
<seg id="15"> None of the two men has serious chances with nominating, but both remain in running, perhaps because they gehauen in former times and harder as others on the immigration bass drum have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At least within the range of the immigration the candidates divide on the whole the same opinions: sharper borders, intolerance opposite illegal Migranten.</seg>
<seg id="17"> This topic, together with fears over poisonous toy from China or other concerns over the remainder of the world, helps to forget the republicans the differences between liberals and Christian conservative ones or minimize.</seg>
<seg id="18"> But the debate was brought clearly problematic as other topics to the language.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Mr. Giuliani was asked, why he had supported weapon restrictions in the past.</seg>
<seg id="20"> John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be regarded as torture.</seg>
<seg id="21"> One the interrogator asked whether the candidates believed each word of the Bible.</seg>
<seg id="22"> This led to the fact that Giuliani held the point of view that although the Bible was its preferential book he the history of Jonah and perhaps literally did not believe the whale.</seg>
<seg id="23"> A further interrogator asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations at the first place in a recently accomplished inquiry in Iowa owing to its Christian conservativism existing for a long time - said that the death penalty was necessary painfully, but.</seg>
<seg id="25"> When it was pushed on it whether Jesus would endorse it, he laughed over and said Jesus was too intelligently for itself for a political office to be applied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Running remains unusually far open.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Huckabees ascent in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls recent donation successes and its applause storms in the debate of Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="28"> These two are not high-shot from that anything, because the two wings of the party could not agree so far yet on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates.</seg>
<seg id="29"> In the year 1980 and 2000 a candidate has the party from the outset and convincingly united with a victorious message over the size of America and a Zwinkern to both wings of the party.</seg>
<seg id="30"> This mark is split the party and the result is by far not clear.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Pain of the labour party</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Gordon Brown discovered still another further pit for falling; its way from this remains the same one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> For British scandals this is not particularly slippery.</seg>
<seg id="4"> No titles of nobility seem to have been sold, have been paid no politician Paris hotel bills, gelutscht no except-conjugal toes.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But uncovering that enrich businessman donations for the British governing labour a party over more than 650,000 Pound (1,3 million dollar) over four years under the name of other people masked, and that the party missed to announce this is something without that contested Gordon Brown well expenditure-come would be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When two months ago ago the Prime Minister had extracted itself from the demand after a choice, in daemliche way the intelligence of the British insulting, by maintaining that public opinion polls would not have affected this decision, gave it hope that he would offer a durable, efficient government.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Instead, like Vince Cable, which expressed increasingly astute agency chairmen that liberally democrat, it, the once which was afraid Brown from Stalin to Mr. Bean developed.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The awkward rescue a bank fastened by Northern skirt, showed regulatorische weakness and bad faculty of judgement under bombardment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Badly thought out suggestions on the change of the tax laws enterprise federations against the government applied.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The taxofficial loss of personal data of 25 million humans pointed inconceivable administrative Pfuschereien out.</seg>
<seg id="11"> A Trio of generals in the retirement started a rebellion in the upper house from protest against shortening of military expenditure: Ministers of the armed forces to be, then maintained them, are a partial time job.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Now there are the various donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labours Secretary-General (and their former fulfilment leader) already withdrew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Nothing of the fact means that Brown retires irrevocablly direction breaks open.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Governments can reach a turning point, after them it nevertheless not possibly feel to govern.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Neither nor humans may trust politicians, but normally hold back them their skepticism, if a new troop seizes the office.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If it is clear that it is improbable that a prime minister improves the situation, and it does not even need for a long time thereby to be, is this delay past: the public service begins to become leaky; the cabinet Ministers begin too plaudern; the press looks for bad messages; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In a way the position of Brown is particularly difficult, because it cannot state contrary to other political leaders, to be a new broom.</seg>
<seg id="18"> So gladly he would deny Tony Blair, was he its first lieutenant.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The problems with Northern skirt and the tax competence documents, for example, hang together with decisions, which Brown made as a chancellor of the Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And even if that were not directly involved in Blairs of misfortunes - how with the long "money for Adelstitel" investigation of political party financing - the voters possibly assume it was it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Nevertheless Browns situation is not completely so bad, as she looks</seg>
<seg id="22"> The misdemeanours are not so terrible, as the conservative ones describe them.</seg>
<seg id="23"> As is the case for Mr. Bean, nobody died, or completely one beschwindelt.</seg>
<seg id="24"> And the remedy, like it to be painful likes, is to be delivered, what Browns naturally stalinistische tendencies to have always promised: A reliable, solidly and easily brutal government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The new Getue around political donations is a good example.</seg>
<seg id="26"> The garboeske Abrahams, which compares its donations with its non-profit gifts, does not say he wishes public acknowledgment for his sympathetic consideration.</seg>
<seg id="27"> That may be perhaps like that, but the decision over it was not entitled to him.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The laws against anonymity for large political contribution payers are clear and them exist for a clear reason: the public has to know a right to it, who can buy entrance to those, which govern the country.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Watt, which says he would have of Abrahams agreement known, but not that she is illegal, naturally some questions it will have itself to place; exactly like Jon Mendlesohn, Labours main financial A driver, to which about the strange donations in October one told.</seg>
<seg id="30"> But so far Brown is not involved: There is nothing that on the fact it points that he knew from these confusion, although the largest part of the payments was made after his taking office in June.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> So far the prime minister settled half of the work.</seg>
<seg id="32"> He condemned fast the injury of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination by reaching for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry to the topic - led, in order to make the measure full, from a bishop in the retirement and a judge.</seg>
<seg id="33"> In this case are not very complicated "from it to pulling teachings".</seg>
<seg id="34"> If the law were broken, it is a thing for the police.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Refrained from it there are other things to make the Mr. Brown must, to find how something a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in the public life, that is vacant for six months, and to in front-walk with a thorough reform of political party financing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> That would require bitter pills for a party comrade from the hard liners of the labour with the conservative ones to cooperate and the special financial relationship up with the trade unions to possibly give - such as Mr. Brown.</seg>
<seg id="37"> But it should be conscious some parteiischen facts.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The conservative ones have now a clear guidance in the public opinion polls; it has to recover two years around voters; and the only way, as it can reach a victory, is by indisputable honesty and solid authority.</seg>

<seg id="11"> According to the Ratingagentur Moody almost was the third quarter default rate of 3.89% a full per cent point below the historical average.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The degradation with the rates can be explained partially by technical factors.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A change in the American private insolvency law laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of declarations of bankruptcy, which constitute again for a large part of the Keditkartenverluste; the number of registrations (and thus default fees) again it would rise whether the general conditions for applicants for the credit worsen or not.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Map exhibitors can react also many faster and more flexibly than credit givers to the stormier conditions, by changing interest rates or credit borders.</seg>

<seg id="1"> England confronts with decision over the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Here two dilemmas, everyone of it nearly just as with difficulty as the other one.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Who is to strike Owais Shah as number 6 for England in Kandy on this weekend, or Ravi Bopara?</seg>
<seg id="4"> And, not less relevantly in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second question is important, because David Graveney, which is a choice chairman, on call at least under this special title, here, in order to decide to help the coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan thereby, and because itself the table of High Morries, which English acting director, gradually with applications for national offices for voter fills, if not even for which in partial time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Whoever does not get the sixth racquet position, will be unfortunate, but the life is often unfair and the sport is undoubted it.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It is never simply, exact festzunageln, which makes humans possible the point its branch of profession to reach, while somebody else never beyond lowest rank, sometimes from lack of luck instead of ability.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is not only in the kricket, where the selection is difficult, where judgements are necessary, which are subjective at the end always.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Is it to be ascended the correct time for Bopara?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Is it fair to Shah if he it does?</seg>
<seg id="11"> The same can be asked perhaps also in a wider range whether for example John Edward or "Tubby" Banerjee, both should be carried intelligent young high-level personnel with good conclusions, which know the business well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Who can say, what the correct class for a Kricketspieler is, it is, it the possibility is given to swim or go down.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Of course numbers have a large influence on decisions, but chances have this also.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Within a team a Kricketspieler must catch the eye of the captain at the correct time, if he can take a Wicket and a racquet must regular chances on the order gets, if he wants to make impression as an one-day Kricketspieler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The eyes of the choice devices to catch is more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="16"> There were many, which in the last season better than, for example, than James Anderson one were, which will apparent play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison kegelt itself for healthy avowedly and like the wind into the nets.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Anderson one took 32 first-class Wickets with ever 33 of run, in order to earn a position in this route.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their points of gloss and to hope for still more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Whether Shah or Bopara in the Asgiriya stage plays, only one opinion question can be.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it makes little difference perhaps nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Before four years in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty in each test played and was successfully in first, with five Wickets and 40 of useful run, it was however Paul Collingwood, at that time fighting for itself to be still strengthened, the break-through to an important Testkricketspieler created and that, although he scored a double one hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> It is probable that Graveney, Vaughan and moorland, after a further discussion in the course of the today's net meeting in the Asgiriya stage will follow their conservative instincts and belly feeling for Shahs larger experience over Boparas juvenile enthusiasm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> There are arguments for both.</seg>
<seg id="24"> For Shah speak its sparkling and valuable 88 test debut Innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, which is seven years younger with 22 years, and a exzellente balance against turned balls.</seg>
<seg id="25"> But Shah made only ten of run in its two Innings in the May against west Indies in the test in lord, for its homeland arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus its immediate refusal of the choice devices as Vaughan was healthy in order to take its position back for the next play, seems the momentum from its striking to have taken which was obvious still in Bombay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In contrast to it the Jack of all trades from Essex has schaufelweise joy of life.</seg>
<seg id="27"> It is impressed and its attitude off of it on the point was brought of nothing on a Kricketplatz, when it had estimated recently a vehicle with four-wheel drive in an exhibition for England sponsor Volkswagen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> It probably suffered smaller injuries and a shock, but first, which he did, was to be taken out its Vodafone (naturally also gesponsort) and to be called its team colleague Alastair Cook, which had observed this from the distance to say and with enthusiasm: "haste you that seen?".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Bopara is a many better field player, he kegelt its central speed with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and strikes with zuversicht and fate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The correct man to select a thing is to select the correct time another.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Perhaps that is the actual art of the selection.</seg>
<seg id="32"> To give I slope in addition Bopara now its chance, what does not mean that Shah will not stand there perhaps nevertheless well, if, as the dte set from Ceylon suggests, it is that, which will play this weekend here.</seg>

<seg id="7"> Today there might be something alive on the surface of the Venus hardly: The atmosphere is approximately hundreds times more closely than on earth, it prevails every now and then to temperatures of 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="8"> "the Venus is perhaps the devil twin of the earth, but she is a twin", said Russel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, hit so completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research, since since beginning of the nineties no more probe was particularly for the study of this planet on the way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The newest research results, which are presented now in several "Nature" articles, do not only underline the singularness of the Venus in opinion of the researchers within the solar system.</seg>
<seg id="12"> "you show also that the thing in common of our neighbour planet with the earth is larger than first accepted", communicate the Esa.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Thus the researchers beside that found already admitted to eddy wind at the north pole also a cloud vortex at the South Pole, which turns still substantially faster.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The phenomenon reminded of air flows on the terrestrial winter hemisphere, writes a researcher team around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The secondaryinternal planet of the solar system has nearly the same mass as the earth and is nearly just as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Also as tomorrow or evening star marked planet circles in scarcely 225 days around the sun.</seg>
<seg id="17"> It turns however many more slowly around itself: A Venustag takes 243 ground connection days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly of the earth reminds, scientists assume both planets under completely similar conditions developed.</seg>

<seg id="3"> To the Revival a Mitschnitt appears from their large time "Live one 1974".</seg>
<seg id="4"> They were substantially more famous abroad already at that time.</seg>

<seg id="7"> Dieter Moebius thront in the bloom-white shirt with 63 years in the center.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Left flanks from Michael red ago, 57 years young and in the possession of laptop and guitar.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Right, regarded from the auditory, Hans Joachim Roedelius, curves 73, concentrated at the console.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Everyone contributes noises, every now and then even a Beat.</seg>
<seg id="11"> And sometimes it adds itself inadvertently to a conventional piece of music.</seg>
<seg id="12"> That does not seem to disturb then also the gentlemen themselves largely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The fact that the volume Harmonia makes music again provided among herb skirt lovers for some excitement.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Whereby one may reveal here: Purposeful demands resulted in that the name did not schwirrte by the collective Popgedaechtnis, but by any means so lastingly, in order to miss this volume for 32 years painfully.</seg>
<seg id="15"> But why not also the German is to be allowed to celebrate its living legends from the seventies-years?</seg>
<seg id="16"> Particularly since what misleading herb skirt is called, was considered in England and America always more than in the own country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> When the music economy lent the survivor of the Cologne group of CAN 2003 the echo price for the life's work, one saw in the hall into asking German Popgesichter.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The problem of the Ignoranz at home and the clarifying in the foreigner is one.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The memory is already overtaxed with Harmonia, because the Trio existed only two years and in this time also a far smaller effect power unfolded than them of others was later assigned.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Moebius and Roedelius had made music to many promising name cluster already before with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under that.</seg>

<seg id="30"> Also a wimpel of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein was alleged and for the art a name in the check garbage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Some held Harmonia of it.</seg>
<seg id="32"> The first album was called "music of Harmonia" and following "De Luxe".</seg>
<seg id="33"> Because so left and modestly the music also sounded, the volume suffered material emergency.</seg>
<seg id="34"> The brushwood collecting did not serve alone the self identification.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The CD "Live ones appeared now 1974" with a concert in Griessem, before one scarcely 50-koepfigen record background was along-cut, as someone believes to remember itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> From red ago at that time the desire came to force and occasionally practice Harmonia.</seg>
<seg id="37"> For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The volume explained its separation to 1975.</seg>
<seg id="39"> Its existence landed red ago with albums like "flaming hearts" in the Esoterisch spherical one and secured themselves.</seg>
<seg id="40"> Since that time cluster was animated in the Achtzigern again and is more successful, than it was Harmonia ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> The Griessemer live album is to be owed to Herbert Groenemeyer.</seg>
<seg id="42"> Its disk company Greenland sat down it to the goal of maintaining the herb skirt as characteristic German contribution to the alive music.</seg>
<seg id="43"> Again! thereby like Roedelius solo work was already excavated.</seg>

<seg id="50"> The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most peculiar sounds in the hall: "those only true music, it belongs the future."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="53"> Before it are again with the improvisation concerned three veterans.</seg>
<seg id="54"> No more, by sticking microphones on the organ and on the schlagzeug, in order to draw from the instruments over tinkered effect devices outrageous tones.</seg>
<seg id="55"> Today the electronic music looks like electronic music.</seg>

<seg id="60"> It never concerned skirt.</seg>
<seg id="61"> The roots were looked for less in the Blues, than in colleges of music (CAN), technologies (power station) or on the escape before artistic and social conventions (cluster).</seg>
<seg id="62"> Who here "' 68!" calls, has not completely wrongly, and Harmonia cannot be brought of it still from the peace.</seg>
<seg id="63"> Still the selfmost understandable is thoroughly considered on the stage.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Richard Gere is simply not zynisch enough</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> With "The Hunting party" and "Moerderi peace" are occupied again two films with the Balkans war.</seg>
<seg id="3"> But both do not convince.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Either the concepts set too much on Action and Geballer or however them are too agitate blessed.</seg>
<seg id="5"> There also Richard Gere in "The Hunting party" cannot help.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The good message first: The war criminals Karadzic and Mladic hide themselves still in the mountains of the Balkans, but just there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, now the actor Richard Gere was regained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties-years last, because all too many nice-inconsequential roles in well-being feeling films for women and all too many press conferences drove the desire out on Hinsehen about Buddhismus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Now is Richard Gere sudden the most important argument, itself "The Hunting party - if the hunter to the chase becomes" (why to have film titles today actually always as long and confused to be as engine driver collective agreements?) to regard perhaps nevertheless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It supplies a marvelously augenzwinkernde representation: Strictly speaking its war reporter Simon Hunt is what from Gere could have become, if the fate and the filmbranche were not so benevolent: A man, who has its very best times for a long time behind itself, who retained its fall still considerable remainders of the former charm however even as ruin-same monument.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But despite this trumpfes "The Hunting party" sets the endless number of failed Balkans war films together with the German production of "Moerderi peace", which likewise starts in this week, only away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> With "Moerderi peace" one can make short process: The film acts of two German soldiers in the Kosovo (Adrian Topol, max of Riemelt), which saves a Serbin from kosovarischen snipers, on which the one promptly also still with her falls in love.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although it is welcome that the Serbs are here once not explained as exclusive root of all evil, the televisionflat film loses itself all too fast in Geballer and Action.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A kind "alarm for Cobra 11" remains without motorway however for it with war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> On the other hand can be investigated at "The Hunting party" almost exemplary, why it did not give actually ever a correctly good Balkans war film.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Perhaps the history of three US war reporters, who open themselves, in order to seek out the Serbian upper war criminal "the fox", could have become with another director and another film script author (both in personnel union Richard Shepard) to another time a new "Apocalypse Now".</seg>
<seg id="16"> Because the stories resemble each other striking: Both marks go small teams into the forest, in order to achieve somewhat, what military to be able and both marks does not become it a journey into the insanity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting party" is that one does not let Simon Hunt be simple the heruntergekommenen cynic with heart, when who is presented he us at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18"> No, the Script must it in addition still another romantic affair with a late murdered Muslim Bosnierin andichten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Finally "The Hunting party" does not go then the brook down, if within the last five minutes in the quick-motion apparatus procedure succeeds to the reporters, what NATO, CIA and all head money hunters of the world in five years creating: The war criminal catch and the Muslim Bosniern to the fair revenge left.</seg>
<seg id="20"> That is so bad that one would like to call the international Court of Justice into the Hague because of crimes against the cinema logic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The film has a deeply human request.</seg>
<seg id="22"> It wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic rumlaufen still freely, and it does not suspect the Americans and the Frenchmen (here they are to be exeptionally times united) pursuit due to secret political arrangements too to operate intensively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But well the meaning and the bad are sometimes so similar itself that a famous breaking poem comes into the sense.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Therein it means over the holzmaske of an asiatic Daemons on the workbench of the poet: to "I see the swollen front veins suggesting Mitfuehlend,: like it is arduous, to be bad ".</seg>
<seg id="25"> Films like "The Hunting party" have exactly such swelling heads, however suggest, like it are arduous to be good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The problem is not limited to the category of the Balkans war film.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Recently it is in this newspaper reports that all Iraq films Hollywoods were large flops.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Those are not Warhols crates</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Who connects the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not at Andy be-get.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Or nevertheless?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At present produced wooden boxes throw dark shade on Warhols list of works in Sweden.</seg>
<seg id="5"> A majority of the ninety-four Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm", listed there, are falsifications.</seg>
<seg id="6"> After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" geschuert some months ago doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes of the yearly 1968, internal investigations come now in the Moderna Museet into Stockholm to a ernuechternden result: The six "Brillo Boxes", which the former director of museum Pontus Hultén bequeathed to the Moderna Museet 1995 as donation, are copies - and probably the majority that approximately hundred further Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm", which are on the international art market in circulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The prehistory is interlocked, a confusing concatenation of artistic and kuratorischer productions.</seg>
<seg id="8"> 1964 created be-get in New York its first "Brillo Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white Design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo".</seg>
<seg id="9"> An exhibition of its work in the Moderna Museet 1968 issued - with Warhols agreement - hundreds of Brillo crates from pasteboard: These originated (from cost reasons) not from be-get, but directly from the Brillo Kartonagenfabrik were delivered.</seg>
<seg id="10"> It concerned not around works of art, but their models, around bare exhibits.</seg>
<seg id="11"> At the same time be-get 1968 have probably permission given for letting some few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden produce which were not issued however in the Moderna Museet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Time witnesses speak now of approximately fifteen crates, which entered at that time as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes with the designation "type Stockholm" rightfully the art and auction history.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Some of them obtained than 100,000 dollar on auctions more.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The problem is now that the legendary director of museum Pontus Hultén falsely maintained later, it 1968 approximately hundred wooden boxes in Sweden was produced and issued, which be-get it then left.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Hulténs 105 crates only 1990 in Malmoe for an exhibition in pc. Petersburg were actually produced.</seg>
<seg id="16"> At this time were be-get already three years dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Lars Bystroem, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, examined three from Swedish private property beside the six museum-own Brillo Boxes also, by which two were made 1968 in Stockholm: Their laminated fiber plates were only primed and abgeschmirgelt, afterwards white oelfarbe with a brush was laid on.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The structure of the copies from the year against the fact 1990 betrays that the color with a painter role without priming was laid on directly on the laminated fiber plate - in addition it concerns not oil -, but around acryl color.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> "these crates were authorized not by the artist and should be removed from the official list from Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes", mention the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve,: "if the ' Andy be-get kind Authentication board ' into New York to another conclusion does not come, the Moderna Museet the six crates in his collection than copy/exhibition material will classify."</seg>
<seg id="20"> Already in July the Authentication announced certainly board to follow to the "heavy accusations" which are raised in things of the soap powder crates.</seg>
<seg id="21"> But since that time one wraps oneself there into inexorable silence.</seg>
