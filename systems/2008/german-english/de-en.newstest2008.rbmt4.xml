<seg id="1"> Food responsible in European inflation</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A principal reason for the increase measured in the eurozone of the inflation are the rapidly rising food prices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In 13 lands of the eurozone the price increase was higher in November than expects - after which 2.6 percent in October an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was registered as the statistical office of the EU reports in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Official predictions have gone out from only 3 percent, announced Bloomberg.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In contrast to American, British, and Canadian issuing bank the European central bank (EZB) has not lowered the Leitzsins. After your judgement the rising raw material prices and the light decline of the unemployment the origin of an inflation spiral would favor the lowering of interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The EZB is bestrebt to hold the inflation rate less than two percent, or at least briefly in the 2-percent brand.</seg>
<seg id="7"> According to an analyst the EZB is in the catch-22 situation: One must "arrange" the inflation to exclude later action need.</seg>
<seg id="8"> With 3.3 percent the inflation rate in November in Germany reached a twelve year-record high; in Spain climbed the rate from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Responsibly for the increase of the inflation in the eurozone are the risen food and energy prices.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The wheat quotations MATIF rose by 88 percent, and the course for soy beans likewise reached a record high since 1973.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Also with edible oil and milk products there was a considerable price increase in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The world price for crude oil rose this year by 52 percent - last month the price per barrel of the black gold reached nearly 100 USdollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The EZB according to will rise the inflation in 2008 from 2.1 to 2.5 percent, indeed, one counts in 2009 on a decline on 1.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14"> For the coming 3-4 months analysts go out from a 3-percent inflation rate, number the annual average rate, however, with 2.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="15"> For 2008 experts calculate on the fact that the EZB will lower the interest twice.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Gallup locates government crisis</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After long stagnating the number of the Fidesz sympathizers has considerably grown till the beginning of December. First since 2002 the party disposes of the biggest base camp, while the approval has reached a never was there low from 13 percent for the socialists according to Gallup.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> With the voters loyal to party the difference precipitates thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates clearly: More than two thirds (71 percent) face to a fifth (20 percent) of approval for the MSZP.</seg>
<seg id="4"> MDF and SZDSZ lie according to survey under the parliamentary entrance hurdle: They come in the whole population on two percent.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The number of the party voters has grown in both camps about 1 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In comparison to the last low the general economic mood has further got worse - never before was the interest of those which judge the economic situation of the land as " really badly ", so high (41 percent), while other 46 percent they hold for "quite bad".</seg>
<seg id="7"> After more hopeful views in the spring and summer the families see the change of her financial position once more more pessimistic.</seg>
<seg id="8"> For the next year the majority of the population counts on an other deterioration of the situation; only one tenth goes out from an improvement.</seg>
<seg id="9"> A Gallup survey carried out in December proved that 71% of the interviewees - a historical high - judged the work of the prime minister as " rather badly as right ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Thirteen percent of the interviewees have big trust or trust in general in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the interest of the advocates puts out 38 percent for Viktor Orbán.</seg>
<seg id="11"> About 54% do not trust the head of the government at all, compared to 27% of mistrust of the party chief of the Fidesz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those, mine, one could gain control of the discontent with the Prime Minister also without change of government.</seg>
<seg id="13"> If still 35% had expressed themselves after the riots in the last October for the whereabouts of the government and the head of the government, today this interest amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Asked according to her interest in the plebiscite 60 percent answered that they participate "with certainty", and other 20% would "probably deliver her vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> To the comparison: if the parliamentary elections took place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would go "with certainty" to the urns, other 15% hold her participation for "likely". In view of these trends the result of the plebiscite would be foreseeable.</seg>
<seg id="16"> 74% would become against the tuition fees, 79% against the practise fee, and tune 84% against the hospital-day money.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Jibed on the group in the plebiscite "with certainty" participant would become the shares of the opponents of the studies fees, practise fees and hospital fees even 81, 84, or 89 percent amount.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Hypermarkets in the Budaörser commercial area have also maintained of this year the average price increase of 16% of the last year, with the difference that there was no rise of the value added tax of this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Article from Napi Gazdaság</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In the Budaörser commercial triangle the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased of this year about 16 percent, indeed, price increases were registered in all hypermarkets by more than 1,000 HOOFS.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After the prices are in the food markets in the last December "davongaloppiert", the price increase prozentuell has been not drastic, compared to the anyway high, earlier source level.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Indeed, it looks deterrent on the consumers certainly that that for what they had paid last year still far less than 9,000 HOOFS this year is not even available for 10,000 HOOFS.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The price of the "Napi" of goods basket crossed the magic 10,000-hoof border about at least 91 HOOFS in the examined markets.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The highest price amounted to 10.573 HOOFS.</seg>
<seg id="9"> (In 6800 the price lay with 6,800 HOOFS.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The prices of Unicum and living fish remained nearly at year before level, have strongly risen, however, the prices of turkeys breast fillets, nut and poppy.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Prices of flour and bread corresponded to the data of the central statistical office of Hungary, nevertheless, with Auchan there was 1 kg of bread reveille for 139 Forint.</seg>
<seg id="12"> There was no competitive-conditioned steep fall in prices on less than 200 Forint with the product.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The price of two liters of Coca Cola security bottle of less than 200 Forint was likewise astonishing here, therefore the drink cost including security only 257 HOOFS.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Still cut of this year in the "Napi" goods basket-comparison Auchan most expensive, and Cora most for a good price from.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Our calculations have proved, that Cora the prices in the "Napi" goods basket compared with the Christmas prices last year around 15, while Tesco and Auchan have raised in each case by 18 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The difference between the cheapest goods basket of the year before and the most expensive one of the wine bar year amounted to 12%, while the rise put out 21% between the cheapest goods basket of the last year and most expensive of the current year.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The average rise in prices amounted to 1,480.00 HOOF.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The average price increase lay in the year before still with 1,206.00 Forint, indeed, the value added tax rise became apparent with the prices to the last Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Exactly this process has dripped trade badly: Apparently the department stores could not decide so surely which prize span they should apply with the single articles, because the consequences of the price increase on the consumer behaviour were unpredictable.</seg>
<seg id="20"> (If the trader plans the orbiting speed of a product badly, he can fall around essential profits in the prize span which is directed after the traffic intensity.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Mehwertsteuer-bedingt the price increase of the "Napi" of goods basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket crossed the value of 2006 about 1720 Forint, while the difference between prices amounted only to 844 Forint with the cheapest basket.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Of this year such extremes were not observed, because the most expensive basket cost about 1,630.00 Forint more than in the year before, and even with the cheapest one there was a rise in prices of 1,284.00 Forint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In the comparison of both last Christmas seasons a catastrophic price increase appeared, the price of the everyday consumption articles in the hypermarkets has risen in less than 20 months by more than 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24"> (This confirms not necessarily the data of the central statistical office of Hungary again: With some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months ascertained a more than 30-percent price increase.</seg>
<seg id="25"> So in possibly beside flour also with eggs.)</seg>
<seg id="26"> If one throws, nevertheless, a look in the "Napi" to goods basket, this seems impossible with latter nearly, because the prize level of the product already expensive in the year before has risen even in the worst case about barely more than 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten - at least, could shift them the drastic price increase on the multinationals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> In the golden commercial triangle the hypermarkets do not complain; It is reported constantly from good years.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Our experience shows that the majority of the customers does not look in three department stores at all at the prices.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It are bought from all large amount, long-lasting food goes to palettes above the counters.</seg>
<seg id="31"> There was Wednesday vormittag in all three department stores endless queues with the Kassa when suddenly the number of the customers exploded.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Indeed, a lower customer frequency is reported about the land, so that many multinationals complain with the pollsters, they could not even reach the planned turnover, namely not only with food, but also with lasting consumer goods.</seg>

<seg id="1"> In many places it is saved in disinfectants</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This year more than thousand infections were registered in the hospitals which were to be led back on an improper contact with antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the Überbelegung of the beds, the overloading of the staff - all factors which are not quite good for damming the infections, according to the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In many places it is also saved with the disinfectants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Traumatologie department of the János of hospital a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was delivered after a heavy accident to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The patient was isolated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Here at the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The injured person of a heavy car accident was dismissed from the hospital, however, after a little while the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation could not since then because of the bacterium which is still in the body of the patient yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Until of this year 10th December 1094 infections released by multiresistant causes were announced from hospitals to the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system, according to the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center, Karolina Böröcz.</seg>
<seg id="11"> So many, by multiresistant causes released infections were registered in the hospitals with certainty, however, the dark figure might be high.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) became from the MRSA, the Staphylococcus resistant to Methicillin-Oxacillin aureus released.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Staphylococcus aureus (SATURDAY) bacterium carries possibly one third of the people in her nose, without it would cause an illness.</seg>
<seg id="14"> SA conditioned infections (as for example pharyngitis, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) react mostly well to antibiotics, they are well remediable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> If the means are measured, however, too high or are applied improperly, the resistant to antibiotics who spread out under suitable conditions in the hospitals fast originate from the well respondierenden bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="16"> In particular with patients with weak, or permanently badly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight these bacteria can cause heavy infections, as for example sore infection or blood poisoning, thus sepsis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> To the medical leader of the János of hospital according to the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the ill house everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="18"> One may mistake the infection not for the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there is not where it is not searched.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Resistant against antibiotics</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> " Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff carries elastic gloves and masks on the care, and we dispose of the antibiotics necessary for the treatment " - thus Tibor Nyulasi.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Indeed, with her admission in the hospital the patients are examined for MRSA, an infection can be still not always avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Test withdrawals too seldom</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The majority of the infections released by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, indeed, the conditions ruling nowadays and circumstances are unfavorably for the containment of the origin or the propagation of the multiresistant cause, says Karolina Böröcz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> After this infection seems mainly in hospitals and old people's homes, the hospitals should examine the delivered patients and isolate immediately MRSA infected.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Nevertheless, in the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological test withdrawal is not carried out so often.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation vonseiten of the state health insurance scheme.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Hence, most cases would come only in the daylight when the patient already has a sensible MRSA infection, according to the medical leader of the epidemiology center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> There is Vonseiten of the European Union strict recommendations to the suitable application of antibiotics in the human medicine, however, there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Antibiotic therapies should be purposeful, that is microbiological investigations are necessary, so that no resistance to the means can form, indeed, this directive is also not always kept by hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Under the ambulant, or itself in the basic care located patients microbiological test withdrawals are even even rarer, according to Karolina Böröcz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> It is saved with the disinfectants</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Scientific proofs prove that MRSA of a patient on other will transfer most often from the nursing staff.</seg>
<seg id="33"> Just, therefore, comes to the hand washing, or carrying of gloves and masks a big meaning to, indeed, there are also in this area considerable defects in the hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> MRSA will transfer by droplet infection or contact, however, in the home hospitals not always exists the possibility to isolate the infected patient.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds briefly are lined up, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from epidemiological view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> As Karolina Böröcz further marks, unfortunately, it even happens in the financially less well put hospitals that is saved with disinfectants, there are few orderlies, many patients - all factors which almost favor the origin of infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Such infections are far less frequent there as can be proved, or the other spreading of the cause can be detained where these preventive measures are kept, according to Karolina Böröcz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Government program against MRSA</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> To gain control of MRSA infections causes to the health insurances huge costs, everywhere, hence, they are fought.</seg>
<seg id="40"> In England the prevention of MRSA, or her containment in the government program became, for example, held on.</seg>
<seg id="41"> After the first signs the program is successful - as published data cover, the trend of the MRSA infections is falling in England.</seg>
<seg id="42"> The European center for illness prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the origin of multiresistant causes (under it also MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of his priorities explained.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The development of the Bulgarian property market is splendid - completely Europe looks carefully at the earlier seldom mentioned Balkan state.</seg>
<seg id="3"> What where, and who shops in the still cheapest market of the EU which becomes more expensive, however, rapidly?</seg>
<seg id="4"> An analysis the Bulgarian Re / Max division.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Bulgaria is nowadays undoubtedly the most popular plaster for real estate purchases in the East European space, with favorable ski apartments and houses by the sea.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Between the mountains the regions Bansko count, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa to him most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "solar coast", and the historical small towns Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, are asked, indeed, real estates all around Kavarna and Balcik also more and more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to appraisals of Re / Max analysts in Bulgaria wid also the inland sooner or later investors attract, thus, for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the really favorable area of soot registers more buyers.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The capital Sofia offers likewise tempting offers - commercial surfaces and office surfaces offer the highest yields.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Bulgaria is to be become on the best way one of the most attractive European golfer's paradise and to attract tourists therefore beside the summer season and wintertime also in both other seasons.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Hence, farsighted investors already make purchases now in the big style, for example, all around Bansko.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> According to analyst the people who acquire real estates in Bulgaria also aim at a change of her conduct.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Most buyers are Englishmen, however, there come also prospective customers from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Investors from Malta and Cyprus are likewise present, while there are mainly Russian buyers with the Black Sea and in the skiing areas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional manager of Re / Max Bulgaria.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Those which want to sit down buy either revitalized real estates about 50-100.000 euros, or dilapidated houses about 5-15.000 euros which they renovate then themselves.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Good binding and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are capitalized, but also the nearness to a city, shops and doctors are vital for the buyers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Those belong to the second category which are in search of a holidays domicile (Bulgaria holiday sighting of the Germans was listed in December under the top Ten).</seg>
<seg id="18"> The businessmen who invest with the purpose of a medium-term to long-term value increase put out the third group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Real estates in the capital become more expensive meanwhile constantly, conditioned by the always waxing inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Indeed, within the EU the real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, however, during the past five years there was a prize increase about yearly 21 percent.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Fodor and six Hungarian percent</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> As minister of the environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert's meetings come to an end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 is continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts and politicians from 192 lands consult on the timetable of Bali in which the issue-reducing measures are fixed for the time after 2012, thus at the end of the Kyoto protocol.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Nowadays a violent debate is between industrial lands and developing countries going.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The USA have already signaled that they do not want to negotiate about concrete figures, indeed, they be would ready to reduce the greenhouse gas issues in comparison to 1990 about 25-40 percent till 2020.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The other big question of the conference is whether the industrial states are ready to support the developing countries financially, as well as beside the reduction of the issues technological.</seg>
<seg id="7"> An agreement about the support was also achieved by developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The adaptation fund subordinated to the Kyoto protocol should be administered by a 16-headed council, probably with the global Umweltfazilität (GEF) of UN, how in the " Piac és profit " is to be read up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Six percent of Hungary</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Minister of the environment Gábor Fodor supports in the name of Hungary the attempt of the EU to maintain her forerunner role with global climate protection measures, and to achieve a new international agreement till 2009.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The minister explained, the EU will reduce the greenhouse gas issues about 20% till 2020 (measured in the values of 1990), no matter whether the " agreement is achieved after 2012 " successfully, or not. The union be would even ready to exert itself for a 30-percent reduction, soferne other big industrial states of the world, or developing countries are likewise ready to follow to her obligations after forces and responsibly.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states which had joined in 1997 to the Kyoto protocol was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, while the EU with her 15 member states at that time had already committed itself to a deficit of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The default for Hungary is reduction of the greenhouse gas issues about 6% in comparison to 1985-87 - a default which will fulfil the land absolutely as in the press release of the ministry of the environment is to be read up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The application is high on Bali - at least, the long-term international climate-political agreement must be ready within two years, otherwise it would come into force with certainty only after 2012. In this case no renewed, international issue reduction system would follow the reduction plans agreed in the Kyoto protocol whose meaning has also emphasized the IPCC, the international scientific climate change-committee excellent with the peace Nobel prize of UN in his latest report.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The issue reduction would be thereby delayed, and the rise of the average temperature of the earth around more than 2°C would be inevitable what would entail extremely serious and irreparable consequences according to scientists.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> unities of the British army have published admissions about operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan for the purpose of popularity increase on the videomain entrance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> At first the British air force (RAF) YouTube has discovered for itself: In Afghanistan stationed special unities load since March, 2006 videos about operations controlled against the Taliban in the net, reports the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The admissions rotated with miniature cameras fastened on helmets are controlled in the air force base in Kandahar and afterwards are sent to London where they are put on the Internet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Political message inevitably</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Soldiers of the air force have already contributed 139 such admissions, her "canal" was looked more than 75,000 times.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The British ministry of defense was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring, 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British foreign ministry (Commonwealth office) and the international peacekeeping forces stationed in Iraq (MNFI) dispose of own YouTube canals.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Originally the air force has the videos with the purpose to recruit soldiers published, and how the ministry of defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose to inform the population about the real purposes of the foreign assignments.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Of such kind of published propaganda is nearly free in comparison to customary television advertisements, thus these videos carry, indeed, defensive expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC always a certain measure in political message in themselves, because they confirm the existence authorization of the military measures agreed by the government in own way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Americans advertise with play</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> However, the army must also fight against amateur's admissions which create it beside the carefully worked on, zensurierten admissions likewise in the net - as for example those which show the death of the soldiers: In to some deceitful, "official" propaganda films it is at most spoken about the losses, nevertheless, the bloody sides of the war are not shown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Numerous videos in use rotated in the application on the platform were loaded, by the way, already by the theatres of war in Iraq and in Afghanistan, the Britons have discovered this "type", however, only a short time ago for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The Americans advertise meanwhile in the a little bit other kind, namely with the free of charge downloadable shooting play "America's Army" in which the player can slip within the scope of a simulation more or less loyal to life in the skin of the soldier.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Political Capital: Hungarian guard raises state risk</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the opinion of the department for risk analysis (Risk Analysing division) from Political Capital the activities in this August with support of the " movement for better Hungary have raised " founded Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and the region in several regard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Among the rest, in the "risk warning-report" of the institute one says: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk shows the " increase of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gipsy and not-Gipsy's population in Hungary which could lead even at short notice to violent ethnic discussions ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Principal reason for it is the strategy of the Hungarian guard which is presumably aimed at the provocation of such a discussion, according to the research institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> As reported, this is looked as an omission by sides of the politically persons responsible: " Persons of the public life have the discussion Roma-Frage Vertretern more radically of political groupings leave which have built up now her political strategy on the Roma Hungary contrast ".</seg>
<seg id="6"> One supposes that aggravate this the problem, the reasonable dialog make impossible, extremities favor above others, as well as would raise the likelyhood of violent discussions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In addition, the Forschungsinsitut means which would have activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the huge attention of sides of the home and foreign media, " the picture of Hungary abroad considerably injured, in particular what the trust concerns in the stability and democratic maturity ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> We remember: Since autumn, 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups is in Hungary continuously in the impetus, so that since summer, 2007 several, " national self-defense association " calling organizations were founded themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> " To these groupings is common that they define themselves in each case as a civil organization, while they boast openly of it, her members on - every now and then armed - to prepare defensive tasks (emergency services, national defense, Ordnungshütung), with reference to the unsuitability of the police, the army, or the state even ", called it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> And further: All that happens according to that method which tries to camouflage different, on the policy and party sullenness of the population based, political attempts as a middle-class initiative.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The stress of the civil character and the association form do not serve only the avoidance of juridical hurdles which could appear in the course of the registration at court - it is at the same time a political strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> How of the analysis is to be taken, the activities of the Hungarian guard show a risikoerhöhenden factor also for the relations with the neighbouring states.</seg>
<seg id="13"> " During the last months the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighbouring states as a potential danger spring, quite a lot of of the ultranationalistic politicians of certain neighboring countries sees in the origin of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own Anti Hungary policy.</seg>
<seg id="14"> All that has consequences on the political stability of the region " - one said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> From the point of the research institute the foundation of the Hungarian guard is no single phenomenon in central east Europe, therefore the political risk has grown for the whole region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As reported, the activities of the Hungarian guard are comparable with those of the Bulgarian national guard whose foundation was announced in August, 2007 by the radically right-wing Bulgarian national union (BNU).</seg>
<seg id="17"> In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian guard there stood the Roma-mass excesses which have taken place in a town quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BNU has taken the incidents immediately to the occasion for the foundation of the national guard, with the argument that the purpose of the organization is the " national protection ".</seg>
<seg id="19"> In her opinion a regular "Gipsy's terror" was perceptible since during the past 17 years in Bulgaria, nevertheless, the state remained idle and indifferent - thus Political Capital.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And further: The initiative would have kicked off a violent debate in the Bulgarian general public.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As said, the raised risk for ethnic discussions is also proved by the fact that have announced some Bulgarian Roma-Organisationen to found her own guard for opposition purposes.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Because the activities of the Hungarian guard up to now many resemblances to those point to the Bulgarian national guard, it is not to be excluded that Hungarian Roma likewise, with organizing her own protection react to the menaces, one says in the risk warning report of Political Capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Attila Juhász, research manager with Political Capital said on inquiry of the press agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Yearly risk analysis reports would be published, and should be recognizable to risk-changing trends, the public opinion is informed, how in the case by the publication of the risk warning report.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Holidays are not everywhere holidays</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In Hungary holidays are exactly regulated legally, so that the practise of the Umdisponierens of the working days has set up all around the holidays meanwhile, indeed, the next year gives to us less such days.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Also in the EU and in America one understands something else by "holiday".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Hungarian judicial system makes a distinction between national holidays and work-free days.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Work-free days are mostly ecclesiastical holidays, or stand with significant historical events in connection.</seg>
<seg id="6"> We celebrate, for example, also New Year: The last day of the old, as well as the first day of the new year are work-free days - latter only already with it itself the New Year's Eve-celebrating can rest.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the whole year we have a total of fourteen holidays.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The national holidays are a 15th March which reminds of the revolution of 1848, and 23rd October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.</seg>
<seg id="9"> 20th August the state foundation, on the 1st May the work famedly, will think on the 1st and 2nd November we of our dead people.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In addition, there is two holidays to Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Because our state, national days or religious holidays seldom fall on a week-end, the practise of the "working day-movement" plans itself in the cases proves itself in which we would work or after the holiday only one day.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, the price of the extended week-ends is that we work on Saturdays before it very well, or must go to the school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> When this day which falls before or after the holiday at last should be processed, for long it is fixed by the employment minister in own order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The statutory regulation counts to all employers and employees, for public employees and official of the civil service equally.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Only companies and equipment in which the company is continued without interruption, thus also in the holidays are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="16"> This year the working rules are mixed up only by the holidays in the end of the year a little bit: In this country from the 24th December the life stops formally, because most for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve time balance, or the vacation specially lifted for it take.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Next year more holidays fall in the weekly middle, or on the end of the week, so that there will be less Umdisponierungen, than this year during the working days.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The calendar is put first all around the day of the work " on the head ", so that the people immediately four days in the piece can stay at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saturday, 26th April becomes a working day, so that Friday, 2nd May a rest day can be.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The second Umdisponierung hangs together with the holiday on the 23rd October: On Saturday, 18th October one will have to process him Friday, 24th October to begin with.</seg>
<seg id="21"> However, at the end of the year will stand completely in the sign of the holidays, after from the 24th December everything lie and stops, even if New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.</seg>

<hl>
<seg id="1"> Six deterrent little things to annoy colleagues</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> E-mails, to send off we forgotten, linguistic news which we never receive - harmless lies which do not strike us at all: They bring "color" in the everyday life in the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The question is bare whether one gets used to this small inconvenience, or one better positions himself to the challenge and tries these ambiguous, for other irritating situations consciously to vermweiden.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Tips.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> " Sorry, I have forgotten to aim to you that somebody has called of the marketing department " - a colleague says.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The fact that one has thereby missed a meeting?</seg>
<seg id="7"> At best one regrets it and tries to make up for it, while one maybe calls with the marketing department and confesses remorseful, one would have forgotten to straighten the news (this is the less usual method).</seg>
<seg id="8"> The thing with an excuse is mostly dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Before one gets entangled in embarrassing excuses, one should consider with which one can prepare really disagreeable moments for his colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> A little bit lent what belongs to itself?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> There is barely something more irritating, as if one reaches for a document, office accessories, or the phone, however, it is not there.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Yesterday the stapler still lay on the desk - today early it is away?</seg>
<seg id="13"> Or is he discovered lost believed ballpoint pens possibly on the desk of a colleague?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Without one should ask himself nothing of the colleagues lend, because they are annoyed rightly if they find out that something has got away.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Thus, no envelope or Post-its from the office in the pocket are, because it could meet one itself: nothing more there if one needs it, nevertheless, urgently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Getratsche about the private life of the colleagues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> There are no effective means to detain a gossip which was already put in the world.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Who with whom, what done?</seg>
<seg id="19"> Where and which is why?</seg>
<seg id="20"> One should bind the information (or supposition) about the private life of the colleagues as far as possible not to everybody to the nose!</seg>
<seg id="21"> And if, nevertheless, somebody opens and betrays to us his most internal secret, we should not abuse this trust!</seg>
<seg id="22"> Best of all one is quiet like a grave instead of straightening the just not person present, even if other about the problems of the colleague also know.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Without reason ill announced?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If one calls in the office to announce himself with reference to tantalizing headaches ill because one feels just unwell, or just would like to rest, one should be about one in the clear: Now own work, unpushable open executions, projects with steady appointments must do the colleagues instead of itself.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Colleagues join in not horribly!</seg>
<seg id="26"> If the day before one knows already that one will not create it the next day in the office, or that something could interfere, why one must stay at home, one should announce it on time, so that neither the colleagues, nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Gesumme, giggling, phoning</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> One is deepened just in his work, it is disturbed, however, suddenly by the loud giggling of the colleagues?</seg>
<seg id="29"> Unintentionally a telephone call listened which one should not better have heard?</seg>
<seg id="30"> One should irritate the colleagues not with sums, singing, loud conversations (which one leads over her heads away), trampling, to durable cursing or grumbling.</seg>
<seg id="31"> All that can be very annoying, even if they write not exactly in a task (, plan, organize) are deepened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Are the others to blame always?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> If a project is not ready in time, one has forgotten an important letter or important directing to send off, one should not search the guilt of own forgetfulness with others!</seg>
<seg id="34"> As far as possible one should not unburden himself on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!</seg>
<seg id="35"> Best of all one admits his mistakes to himself, and apologizes, if other were also concerned by it!</seg>
<seg id="36"> The question, as one make up for the mistake, or the missed can make up, is only much too right!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In the office - a feeling like at home?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Tracksuit bottoms and Schlapfen: However, comfortably for at home, nothing has lost in the office!</seg>
<seg id="39"> Then one should not even dress so casually if it the workplace admitted, actually!</seg>
<seg id="40"> Only do not become too sloppy - one should his colleagues, as well as respect himself so far that one dresses in the office accordingly - if desirably, also nicely and elegantly!</seg>

<seg id="1"> It to all want to prepare - or how one becomes dull for others</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of taking place every morning traffic jam.</seg>
<seg id="3"> From the radio there sounds a strange melody: The sound of a violin, combined with electronic effects.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I turn the volume higher.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The tempo changes, to the present sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It is the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar which sounds on mr2.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The home music scene has spoiled us for a long time not exactly with qualitative Electropop.</seg>
<seg id="8"> But now one sees even the traffic jam different if one hears, besides, the new album from Zagar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The appearance of Yonderboi, quite a lot of new and thrilling production from the home digital Underground scene slowly contribute to a change of the general view, and even if the garage rock with his Gitarrengequitsche is again "in" which proves home Electropop: There is new under the sun.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Balázs Zságer has started in Pécs, made music even in the volume Yonderboi, before he started to walk - maybe because a pub stands no two pipers - his own way.</seg>
<seg id="11"> He created the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music which melts elements from jazz, Electronic, and pop, however, only when one with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film, had moved up to him (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="12"> "Szezon" of Ferenc Török).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The formation which had appeared in the beginning in smaller clubs only became known to the broader audience than the magazine "wan2" lined up her first album from the year 2002 under the top to 50 home albums and chose Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to the nearly only trendsetter also capable of market in the west.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Undoubtedly Zagar and his tape were "trendy", however, it interested nobody whether they carry this brand also with pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The tape has reacted as it should go: With a new, still better album.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The new album appeared now with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new ways for them, indeed, the title already expresses the wish for continuity with the Pécser years.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The expression is descended since from the time when Balázs Zságer was on the move still with another volume.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The aerial, flying allusion would be also in order, indeed, they strike beside the ethereal character of the music - to the spirit of the times and the trends suitable - pure guitar, the influence of the rock'n'roll.</seg>
<seg id="19"> With these songs " The of jigsaw puzzle " working singer György Ligeti with the première has fancied in England living and with the volume in the Millenáris.</seg>
<seg id="20"> A song of the album has created it even to the radiohit - since newest from morning till night pop music sending mr2 Petőfi has put the earwig to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love" which was taken up in collaboration with six home singers (" Underground of divas ") successive.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Everything in order.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Hvg.hu has asked with Balázs Zságer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> hvg.hu: This new hit throws up the question: To what extent is your music of a certain layer left?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Balázs Zságer: The concept "Layer music" signifies to me not exactly a lot.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In my opinion there are two castes in the pop music, namely not mainstream and Underground, or Alternatively and pop, but Commercially and honestly.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Even the so-called Alternatively or Underground music can be shallow and be inexpressive, however, just they can be even produced for the sales which play musik they too more commercially.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Also a good pop number can originate from an honest motive.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The admission readiness of the listener also functions after this principle, from languages and land borders independently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> hvg.hu: Are you up a difference in the openness of the Hungarian one and the foreign audience of your music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> B. Zs .: Abroad, in particular to the west of us the pop music has a bigger tradition.</seg>
<seg id="31"> There go not only teenagers or Twens on concerts, but also the older audience.</seg>
<seg id="32"> They pursue the trends in the pop music which happen round them, much more carefully because they hold them also for a part of the contemporary culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> hvg.hu: Which role comes to the audience to at your work?</seg>
<seg id="34"> Is it important, who, where how many hear your music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> B. Zs .: Of course it is a good feeling to see that come more and more to our concerts.</seg>
<seg id="36"> However, we have never composed for the market.</seg>
<seg id="37"> With us the music not originates to serve a purpose, but for certain reason.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The role of the audience is mostly perceptible with the concerts where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is that again only in the unhandy changes of the moment.</seg>
<seg id="39"> Still has struck me one: If you want to make it to all right, you are no more interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> hvg.hu: How far would like you to follow the example of Yonderboi?</seg>
<seg id="41"> He is on the move as a soloist and has built up his career rather in the west.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> B. Zs .: We do not go really his way, sometimes of it completely seen that one tries over and over again, this in our music hineinzuinterpretieren.</seg>
<seg id="43"> We see ourselves rather than a team player which allow to trust in the musical presence of the other and develop them.</seg>
<seg id="44"> In the beginning comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were unavoidable of course, because several of us from his tapes come and have smashed another way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> hvg.hu: In the charts from mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" stands, firstly.</seg>
<seg id="46"> Many have heard only in connection with this number the name Zagar.</seg>
<seg id="47"> Was the opening with a little more popular style produced in the direction of a broader audience consciously?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> B. Zs .: We had no plans to write a hit which should hold out then as a draft horse for the album.</seg>
<seg id="49"> In this song it goes around more.</seg>
<seg id="50"> It was intended as a finale of the album with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the a little more difficult subjects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> hvg.hu: How have you selected six singers?</seg>
<seg id="52"> Why just they what was the leading principle?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> B. Zs .: The basic idea was to do a gospel song-like choir.</seg>
<seg id="54"> Then there came the idea to put together the choir from gifted soloists of the home music scene.</seg>
<seg id="55"> Thus the 6-headed choir has originated - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik ő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we have christened then apäter " Underground of divas ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> hvg.hu: Wanted you to have the song just, or have the girls coformed it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> B. Zs .: There was the number long since in the instrumental version, but when the material was ready for the album, we imagined that this number still needs " something ".</seg>
<seg id="58"> The chord sequence has asked formally for a song voice.</seg>
<seg id="59"> I have the melody still at the same night eingesungen, later they have learned the girls.</seg>
<seg id="60"> Everything came practically right away and alarmingly spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="61"> I can remember, at that time I was quite electrified, but it has required already also of the "divas".</seg>
<seg id="62"> With my voice the song would never only have become so strong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> hvg.hu: However, on the record, as well as with the concert one had the impression, the girls would be in the background.</seg>
<seg id="64"> There is no solo part (apart from short Solo from Judy Jay), they have no own role, sing completely together and are not louder than the music, is accompanied thus her song by the music not only.</seg>
<seg id="65"> Also on the stage they stood behind.</seg>
<seg id="66"> Is it an intention?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67"> B.Zs .: The fact that they have stood behind, was because of purely technical problems in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="68"> Indeed, we wanted to let them consciously no solo roles come up.</seg>
<seg id="69"> In the number it is also about the fact that one should forget his ego a little, forget who is on the move where from come and where, we simply allow that to us these certain wings, the wings of the love raise.</seg>
<seg id="70"> I would have with pleasure that also other feel this euphoric state which we have felt when the song has originated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> hvg.hu: Which was the costliest song?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> B. Zs .: At the musical creating work, actually, none, it has given rather with the mix more difficult tasks.</seg>
<seg id="73"> For example, with the " Dorian Gray''s dilemma " in which I play on a concert piano, or with " rock'n'roll of Goes To The Girls " where the grooving did not want to function longer, however, bit by bit everything has fitted together, how with a jigsaw puzzle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number of the new album?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75"> B. Zs .: This changes with the concerts constantly and also now where I have the album "losgelasssen".</seg>
<seg id="76"> Nowadays these are "prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number " Never The of seed ".</seg>

<seg id="4"> She came since because of him about nearly five billion euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> However, it seems rather in such a way that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to touch it his colleagues, in addition, certainly was not incapable.</seg>
<seg id="6"> To the difference to all big bank houses he recognized on time the crisis by the amerikanischenn mortgage market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> " He is psychically rather weak, " was to be heard from the mouth of his superiors who indicated him at the police.</seg>
<seg id="8"> How, however, it arises from the statements Kerviels which published the French media, for example, the newspaper Le moons, he was a person, the end of the last year with his shops profits at the rate of 1.6 billion euros had achieved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Crisis not only in America</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> " Everything what I wanted was to be earned for my bank money, " he states in his statement.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In summer he had succeeded in earning half a billion euros just on the American crisis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition he had spotted of the opportunity since already in the beginning of the year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> In February there was the quite first news about the fact that so-called Sub Prime mortgages, like they had income-weak customer or such, the before redemption problems, would be given, get in difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="14"> However, influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kerviel did not believe this and kept right.</seg>
<seg id="16"> In the end of the year he had raised his profit up to 1.6 billion euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> " Already as me the first half a billion had earned, I did not know how I should explain this, " admits Kerviel and repeats that he has kept definitively nothing for himself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> During the whole questioning he admits that he has faked documents, so that one would not come to him on the tricks.</seg>
<seg id="19"> He succeeded even in leading his bosses behind the light, even if bit by bit the Eurex stock exchange been interested in his shops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Risk profit</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Did he fear to fly up?</seg>
<seg id="22"> Probably barely.</seg>
<seg id="23"> " I thought that she satisfies the simple fact that I have earned 1.6 billions for the bank. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Where from he took the courage to risk so much?</seg>
<seg id="25"> He had to work his position gradually.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> He entered into the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after he had finished his study at the university of Lyons.</seg>
<seg id="27"> His annual salary amounted to about 51,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="28"> After two years he was already an assistant of a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Still he knew that he will never earn so much like others.</seg>
<seg id="30"> " Already in my first conversation in 2005 I knew that one observed me.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development, " explained Kerviel the inquisitor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> But soon after his entry there came the first big success.</seg>
<seg id="33"> With the stocks of the alliance he earned a lot, while he put half a billion euros on course losses of this title in the London bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="34"> And this was the trigger - now he wanted more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As long as you do profit, we leave you</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> " This is like a snowball, " he said the policeman.</seg>
<seg id="37"> But the bosses knew supposedly about all, or anticipated it.</seg>
<seg id="38"> " As long as I earned money, one closed the eyes. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> However, then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.</seg>
<seg id="40"> During one single day he lost a billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="41"> On a week-end at the middle of January he wanted to compensate this.</seg>
<seg id="42"> When he came on Monday to the work, he was already no more an employee of the bank.</seg>
<seg id="43"> And a few days later the bank announced that it has lost because of him five billion euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> And how did they come to him on the tricks?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Suspicious he came along by a vacation.</seg>
<seg id="46"> " I have taken only four days of the year before.</seg>
<seg id="47"> A broker who takes no vacation is one which does not want that one looks to him in the maps, " said Kerviel finally.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Budget is by</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, it is created.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The budget is approved.</seg>
<seg id="4"> What is in this household a special?</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is the first household which this government has sketched, and without support of the opposition was accepted by the coalition majority.</seg>
<seg id="6"> For the current year was still approved with support of the ČSSD (social democrats) because him minister Sobotka (from this party) had presented, and which could not allow itself ČSSD, therefore to reject him.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This time as opposed to lively debate before the vote about the motion of no confidence against the government nothing happened dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The chamber of deputies approved of this traditionally little notable, still extremely significant law in complete silence.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This is paradoxical as it were.</seg>
<seg id="10"> All governance begins and ends with the single chapters and posts of the household whether that likes or not.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The household is an essential component of the policy, however, is covered by the struggle for power of the government and the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="12"> This is a more thankful subject for the media, and, therefore, they dedicate to him more attention.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A quarrel among politicians is much more interesting for the general public than sober figures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The budgets suffered at the past social-democratic governments from three weak points which the household can remove for 2008 not all at once:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The first one is the high interest of issues which oblige for law and it concerns not only the pensions, but also around the social expenses which the "silent" coalition from ČSSD and KSČM (communist) has decided last year before the choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The second one is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weak point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. to the budget deficits of the municipalities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id="19"> This household is public and eingermaßen under control.</seg>
<seg id="20"> However, a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Many mayors gave to open other springs for investments except income from taxes, deliveries and bank loans, often unthinkingly the debentures from by which they been to blame for her city halls in the excess.</seg>
<seg id="22"> During the last years they succeeded, these debts by plentiful sales of stocks of the energy nets and other supply networks which they had received in the train of the privatisation from the state to pay off.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Now this spring has already dried up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> As far as we keep only to official and checkable facts, we find out, that:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> our economy already for some years, like the rest of the world, a growth phase runs through which boasts ČSSD without respite.</seg>
<seg id="26"> This showed a unique possibility for her governments to fix the public finances.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Instead, these governments been to blame for the state, nevertheless, even more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Other lands, apart from a few exceptions like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have economized much more rationally than our republic.</seg>
<seg id="29"> This is a gigantic disgrace which is to be ascribed mainly to the earlier governments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> We belong to the lands which, seen in the global graduation, in least by poverty are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Therefore, no nassiven social programs which were inflated, unfortunately, just during the last years quite superfluous-wise in huge magnitude are necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Even if it has succeeded, a part of the senseless populist issues which were dismissed this year before the choices to glide is clear that if it does not come in the next time for a movement of the pensions entry age and to a pension reform, then any policy ends practically in this land, and, no matter who is in power, nothing but will remain to him pure administering.</seg>
<seg id="33"> It is only easily exaggerated if one says that then from ruling politicians official become who split the biggest part of the inland revenue mechanically on pensions and social expenses.</seg>
<seg id="34"> Therefore, this year's household can be no revolution, but can order only to the displacement of normal issues by duty expenses stop.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The deficit intended for 2008 of 70 billion crowns would be absolutely superfluous if earlier governments had not been economical during the last ten years what only went.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If we do not want that it really arrives that from ruling politicians pure administrative official become, then we must be patient and wish this not too strong coalition government which is aware, however, of that that the state can be economical only so much, as he is able to take in taxes and fees, rest by the preparation of other reform laws.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Only these allow a gradual penetration of a well-balanced budget.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Thus more than 100 billion dollars will reach by means of auctions the currency markets.</seg>
<seg id="4"> On these auctions the banks auction interest rates for which they are ready to borrow mutually money.</seg>

<seg id="12"> " It looks in such a way that the position is really bad, " he repeated.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves hard have access to loans, for her customers loans become also more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="14"> This would reduce the consumption and overthrow the American economy in a recession, possibly with consequences on the economic growth in the whole world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The central banks have decided on it, after they had not succeeded, the so-called. To lower LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate which is used with the monetary rental company between banks.</seg>
<seg id="16"> This means that the banks were afraid constantly to borrow money mutually, and this although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the autumn her interest rates several times had lowered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> " This will have the same effect like an other sinking of the interest rates, " Greg Salvaggio of tense Consulting of the agency said Reuters.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="4"> Now the criticism referred to the coming to an end international conference of UN to the climate change on Bali.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In Vienna where he presented his book " blue, no green planet " he explained that the debates of the ecologists are unplausible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to Klaus not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of not-government organizations, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric which she accompanies, and the reality.</seg>
<seg id="7"> " The debate there is unstructured, these are word fireworks, the only substitute is for a real solution of present problems, " said Klaus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Czech president stressed by the image of his book that his subject is very important for him, and that he is involved in it, therefore, so.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He also expressed his contentment about the fact that his book appears in German translation because " I often hit on caricatures of my views. "</seg>
<seg id="10"> Now prospective customers could read up his setting undistorted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Klaus reminded of the fact that it is no Klimatologe, but he has to his opinion after sufficient conditions to write such a book.</seg>
<seg id="12"> He is, in the end, a graduate to understand capable, technical treatises and to judge, experience with statistics has and is also an economist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He called the thesis main statement of the book that the climate changes constantly and that his changes are normal that there is no correspondent opinion among the scientists to the global warming that the results of the present changes are big not too and serious and showed therefore no menace, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are is superfluous, luxurious ineffectively and unacceptably.</seg>
<seg id="14"> In addition, he holds it as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen, for unacceptable to force upon other unproven views he considers as a dangerous restriction of the freedom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> On questions of persons present he explained repeatedly, he is not against a " reasonable environment protection, but against militant ecological activists who take no consideration on the relation between expenditure and yield. "</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, from the hospital wants to ask in Třebí č 12 million crowns of compensation plus costs of an action.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Polívka came around his kingdom Walachei</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Bolek Polívka lost the quarrel around the brand " kingdom of Walachei ".</seg>
<seg id="3"> Indeed, of the judge in the municipal court in Ostrava according to he has used as more first the name " Walachischer of king ", but the project had built up in long-standing work a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Today Polívka did not take part in the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="5"> However, according to his lawyer the thing is not probably finished with it and his mandator will probably insert appeal.</seg>
<seg id="6"> " The quarrel goes about the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitär, " said after the negotiations Polívkas lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Everything fancied just this actor and comedian with the words " Walachisches of kingdom ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Of the same opinion is also Harabiš.</seg>
<seg id="9"> " We have an almost ten-year-old work behind ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="10"> He said monetary procurement and drafts of the activities, ".</seg>
<seg id="11"> To him according to the occasion is a quarrel around money.</seg>
<seg id="12"> " After years has struck them that the project is successful and that they could also have a little bit of it.</seg>
<seg id="13"> They want to win parasitär in our work, " he repeated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Lucrative business</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> According to the court used Polívka the name " Walachischer of king " for the first time in one of his telecasts.</seg>
<seg id="16"> In 1993 actor Radoslav Brzobohat ý crowned him.</seg>
<seg id="17"> At that time, however, this did not hang together with the intention to found a fictive kingdom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some years later there came Harabiš on the thought to spend walachische passports.</seg>
<seg id="19"> From an originally funny action there crystallized a business and an enterprise activity out to which Harabiš connected then the foundation of the company " Walachisches of kingdom ".</seg>
<seg id="20"> In 1997 Polívka of the use of his name and his signature agreed in the passports and offered to her owners even reductions in the visit of his farm and his stage performances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Who will sit on the throne?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Today the judge also stated that Harabiš used only the bare idea which has publicized Polívka in the broadcasting "manege" for his enterprise intentions.</seg>
<seg id="23"> " The popularity Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the walachischen kingdom, " said the judge.</seg>
<seg id="24"> However, she added that the soul of the project Harabiš and his team are which would have intensely devoted themselves to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The collaboration of the parties fallen out today lasted up to 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Since then, however, there started to pile up between Polívka and Harabiš the disputes which culminated in the dismissal " king Boleslavs I. electively up to the Saint Nimmerleins day ".</seg>
<seg id="27"> Then the guide roller took up on suggestion Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as a queen mother.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Then in 2002 Polívka submitted the complaint which rejected the court today against Harabiš and his company.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The competition prepared by Harabiš could bring clearness in the quarrel around the throne and half a princess.</seg>
<seg id="30"> A new king should arise from it.</seg>
<seg id="31"> He did not want to betray details and an appointment yet.</seg>
<seg id="32"> " We want to rush nothing.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Voruteile dwindle</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> To say the truth, I never was a special fan of Peugeot 206.</seg>
<seg id="3"> His handling characteristics were not a lot worth, one could call the quality of the way circuit, the steering system and also the processing rather subnormal.</seg>
<seg id="4"> However, now is his successor, Peugeot 207, at the market, and he is better around a lot.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The station-wagon with the name SW is other one more piece, and to me remains only to revise my opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When I had tested the classical Hatchback of 207, I had to complain, for example, of the too low head room on the Hintersitzen.</seg>
<seg id="7"> There is this discomfort now no more, because the bodywork of the station-wagon is so formed that Zweimetermänner will not even suffer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Quick further</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> I go through the interior equipment only briefly not to recur too much.</seg>
<seg id="10"> It concerns a rather successful design where I have objections only because of the miserable middle tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="11"> There I would greet a little bit more designerische creation where the car does, otherwise, such an elegant impression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The seats are comfortable, and past are the times where we complained, perhaps, to too short seats or headrests.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Also the side hold has substantially improved compared with 206.</seg>
<seg id="14"> What concerns the space offer, one can also feel here the enlarged dimensions of the bodywork.</seg>
<seg id="15"> In the station-wagon the already mentioned lack of head room is also removed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Suitcase in the boot</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> However, the central issue in this car is the loading bay.</seg>
<seg id="18"> I must call him (also because of the openable back window) very well loadable and space-saving.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The hollow cavities are equipped with hold belts which show an ideal compromise.</seg>
<seg id="20"> They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and also hold on heavier objects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> However, we talk about the loading volume.</seg>
<seg id="22"> It amounts according to table in the basic equipment to 428 liters what is a rather average value in comparison to competition.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Indeed, not in comparison to vehicle bestselling in Czechia of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.</seg>
<seg id="24"> If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find out that Peugeot stays behind about clearly perceptible 52 liters.</seg>
<seg id="25"> For a foreign vacation or with the invitation of a baby carriage this value is already critical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But to emphasize around the Positiva, I must still mention on folding down the back seats quite level loading bay or also the very low loading edge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> 120 HP in four rows</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Our test car was equipped with a four coil petrol engine with cubic capacity 1.6 liters and an achievement of 88 kW.</seg>
<seg id="29"> And honestly said, so a 1600Kubik engine should look which drives a Familien-Hatchback.</seg>
<seg id="30"> He is quiet, has a low consumption and moves well.</seg>
<seg id="31"> If I compare him to his counterpart in Škoda which sometimes works as if his exhaust with a cloth was blocked, then I can be only inspired by him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The price-list speaks volumes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The price of this car is not quite popular.</seg>
<seg id="34"> However, we must remember that we have tested a well equipped car with a spacious Innneren and a very good engine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> The base price of the car with the 1400th petrol engine at the rate of 329,900 crowns still begins.</seg>
<seg id="36"> With our engine it costs from 410,900 crowns what is already quite a lot.</seg>
<seg id="37"> The equipment premium of the test car hits once again with 80,000 crowns in addition to beech.</seg>
<seg id="38"> However, we had head air bags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic windshield wiper release, electric window lifters behind and and...</seg>
<seg id="39"> Thus the car costs all together settles 531,900 crowns.</seg>
<seg id="40"> This is an amount, but you add up once the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will come with a quite similar sum.</seg>
<seg id="41"> Thus only the decision remains which brand one wants to choose.</seg>

<seg id="9"> The police also had to intervene after an attack of two girls under age on a Slovak immigrant.</seg>

<seg id="3"> What always you expect from your vacation, this will come true if you select only the right thing.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea which is quiet like a pond.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Palms and all Inclusive with the waiters who offer pizza, ice and beguiling cocktails on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Kitesurfing, gulf and roulette.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the islands of the Caribbean you find in superabundant measure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, only on an island you still find even more, and this island is Cuba, biggest and nicest of the Greater Antilles.</seg>
<seg id="9"> At the moment the Spaniard was Cuba their bastion for the conquest of America.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Columbus called it the nicest place which has seen a human eye.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Once Havana became a camp or transit camp of treasures which had robbed of the Spaniards in America and advanced then to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12"> And then there came the American epoch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Hotel Nacional completely originated at the end of the 20-th century.</seg>
<seg id="14"> One of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano allowed to build it, because everything what counted in the USA as a crime (especially during the prohibition) was seen on Cuba with pleasure and was supported - drugs, game of chance, prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Among his guests were among other things</seg>
<seg id="16"> Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In Havana grew blocks of flats, over the wide boulevards the cars which counted to the cult symbols of the fifties of the past Jahrhundets went.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Ernest Hemingway bought to himself a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lie.</seg>
<seg id="19"> On the walls of the Bodeguita del midmonth stars of the show business and politicians from completely America left her signatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> And today?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.</seg>
<seg id="22"> At the bar at hotel Nacional one mixes for you cocktails completely by wish.</seg>
<seg id="23"> And the cult cars of the fifties travel around in Havana till this day because the Schigulis imported once and Fiat have broken up in the salty and humid air long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="24"> If Havana, in particular his oldest part, may strongly have come down, one nowhere finds in the vicinity so many miraculous colonial places of interest like exactly here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Other places are just dressed up, for example, Trinidad.</seg>
<seg id="26"> In regard on the fact that the tourism brings urgently required money there was for this development green light.</seg>
<seg id="27"> During the last fifteen years new hotels have originated not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province Holguín and also on islet like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and other.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Cuba offers one more quirk which is unique in the world and draws above all railroad lover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Steam-pursued and diesel-pursued small-time roads brought the sugarcane of remote plantations to the sugar factories.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Their vehicle park was not renewed for decades, and thus one sees there the comical and fully functioning railroad engines whose contemporaries stand somewhere else for a long time in the museum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Destinations</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The majority of the visitors of Cuba does not let out the bedeutendendsten places.</seg>
<seg id="33"> Thus one must write about Varadero or Havana no more in detail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Remains only to mention that in the already mentioned property Hemingways a museum is whose visit to itself that which likes this author should not allow to escape.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="36"> The luxuriant vegetation grows in lime ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The Mogotas, lime hill and lime rock, rise precipitously from the valley ground, in her hollow cavities fertile ground collected, are covered by the also weather-beaten cliff areas of thick growth.</seg>
<seg id="38"> It is this valley where the maybe best Cuban tobacco is grown.</seg>
<seg id="39"> In his final form you can hit on him if you visit one of the cigar factories of Havana.</seg>
<seg id="40"> Possibly it seems to somebody also interesting that there the Chilean result of the TV serial "major Zeman" was turned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Trinidad</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> An ancient town, briefly, after the Spaniards had settled in the island, was founded.</seg>
<seg id="43"> Fame and wealth brought her trade with slaves and sugar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> The wealth embodied itself in the smart beauty of the small town.</seg>
<seg id="45"> The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influences from the later French colonists, has barely changed for 400 years.</seg>
<seg id="46"> Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountains situated, is such a backwater that there was there still in the fifties of the last century no street which would have connected the area with the remaining land.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> This isolation contributed to the fact that there remained unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="48"> Nothing was built there, but, therefore, was also torn off nothing, everybody was glad that he had a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="49"> If one has time for Trinidad more than one afternoon, it is worthwhile to look at interesting places in the surroundings, as for example the beach Playa Ancón or the " valley of the sugar factories ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Then in the evening one should go to the Casa de la Música which revives after the darkness, and where the music is not quiet up to the morning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Baracoa</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> Some call this small town completely in the east of Cuba the nicest one of the island.</seg>
<seg id="53"> Absolutely this view is also influenced by the way there.</seg>
<seg id="54"> Both streets which lead from Guantánamo there must overcome high and zerküftete mountains and run by a scenery which is barely touched by human interventions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> UNESCO took up this eastern outpost of Cuba thanks to the untouched nature there in her world heritage list.</seg>
<seg id="56"> There the best chocolate is produced, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it has originated about hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and several mesas from which El Yunque is the best known one are to be seen by the hill where the former castle, current hotel El Castillo, stands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the pork bay and the island Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctum of Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess about all this one could write many sides.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Not enough soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influences according to the United States the course of the mission in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="3"> NATO should sketch according to the words of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates a concrete plan for the next years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The mission in Afghanistan does not run according to her images, the representatives of the lands who have stationed unities in the south of the land agreed in Scottish Edinburgh about it.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Beside the growing opposition of sides of the Taliban eight participant states also discuss other coordination plans among the allies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> While the United States called the Nato unities for more activity by her Verteigungsminister Robert Gates, Great Britain sees the priority in the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and in the intensification of the development aid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> " In Afghanistan a Vorwärtsentwicklung is perceptible, but military power can be only one part of the solution.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Another part consists in allowing to the inhabitants, in beginning even a development of the economy and security, " says the British Verteigungsminister of the Browne of the BBC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Ninety percent</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest state for five years according to the American army.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The number of power actions has risen in comparison to year before by 27 percent, in the southern province Helmand even about sixty percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Nato lands have stationed in Afghanistan about 40000 soldiers, of it possibly one quarter in the southern territory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> However, according to the United States the allies have bumped to an absolute border what concerns organization and equipment of the unities.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Specifically they demand other helicopters, soldiers and experts to the training of the Afghan unities.</seg>
<seg id="15"> " We will seriously have to think about the concrete purposes for the next time and about the way how we can reach them, " said gates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Today similarly the secretary general of NATO, Jaap de Hoop commented.</seg>
<seg id="17"> " I am not delighted about what we have at disposal in Afghanistan to land and in the air.</seg>
<seg id="18"> We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment which we would need, and this is not enough, " De Hoop of the agency said Reuters for the end of 3-day conversations with the Japanese government in Tokyo.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Who is passive</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Under the involved lands quarrel rules during the last months also about whether all allies give her best in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Because of passiveness, for example, Germany was criticized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> " The Germans are represented in Afghanistan relatively numerously.</seg>
<seg id="23"> However, they are stationed in areas where there is only one minimum of power and the fight requirements are not so high for them as for us in the southern and eastern part of the land, " said gates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" called this week the German soldiers slackers.</seg>
<seg id="25"> " Unmasks Afghan idlers: The Germans do plays, while our boys fight, " wrote the "Sun" in a contribution which was complemented with photos of German soldiers who play table tennis.</seg>
<seg id="26"> The German picture newspaper went over to the counterattack and printed a picture of a British unity with a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.</seg>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The national debts of Czech Republic rose till the end of September on 842.7 billion crowns.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Within the first nine months of this year they rose therefore by 40.2 billions.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, since June they sank by 13.4 billions.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Ministry of Finance confirmed with it his information about the national debts from beginning of October.</seg>
<seg id="10"> A guilt of 84,000 crowns is cancelled to every Czech.</seg>
<seg id="11"> About the whole last year the state got into debt around more than 111 Miliarden crowns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> " Till present it seems that we will cross the border of a trillion crowns possibly thanks to the lower deficit for the next year only in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The next year the debts should move between 900 billions and a trillion crowns, " said David Marek, analyst of the Patria Finance, to the server iHNed.cz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Similarly it sees Vladimír Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance: " To the excess of a trillion we could come in the course of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="15"> When exactly, depends on the next household which we do not know yet.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If should appear that the situation on the political stage changes, and the politicians should be ready more to save, could last up to 2010.</seg>
<seg id="17"> But from such a change I do not go out, " he noted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Debts grow</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The national debt is due to the debts of the state government and comes above all from the accumulation of deficits of the budget.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The national debt is financed by treasure instructions, state debentures, direct loans or, for example, by loans of the European investment bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The home state indebtedness rose this year meanwhile on 719.4 billion crowns.</seg>
<seg id="22"> The foreign debts of the state rose meanwhile by 1.7 billion crowns on 123.3 billions.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The so-called national debt capable of market reached billions crowns at the end of September, 803.3 and sank since June by 13.7 billions.</seg>
<seg id="24"> The average maturity of the national debts rose for 6.5 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> " The whole guilt rose about the year from first up to the third quarter by 13 percent what is really a lot in view of that how well it goes for the economy.</seg>
<seg id="26"> It is interesting that the taking is to be registered above all with the debentures where the increase amounts to 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27"> It is bad that the debts rise, but then this shows that one can undertake something, already before the pension reform comes, " commented Pikora the data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Better than expects</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> From the financing strategy and the contact with the national debts for 2007 it arises that the government had planned for this year to take up 159.2 billion crowns.</seg>
<seg id="30"> At the beginning of December the ministry thanks to the better development of the state Hauhaltspolitik reduced the plan, nevertheless, on 152.8 billion crowns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> This amount is due above all to the state budget deficit which will reach obviously 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billions this year.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Further it concerns at most included in the plan means for the consolidation agency at the rate of 13.3 billion crowns, a 10 billions reserve to the payment of the pensions, the financing of state debentures for 43 billions and rates for the loans at the European investment bank at the rate of 1.8 billions.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Today for the fact that she has given a name to a teddy bear it was brought forward to a court in Khartum.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to information of her lawyer the British teacher who had been accused in Sudan of insults of Islam was condemned on the Thursday evening by a court in Khartum by 15 days of custody and next expulsion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Briton was accused to have permitted 6 to seven-year-old pupils, to give the name Mahomet to a teddy bear, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="4"> She would have earned to be whipped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> After parents of pupils had complained several times with the Sudanese Ministry of Education and the Arts, the 54-year-old basic schoolteacher who was active in the Unity High School of Khartum on Sunday was taken up with herself at home and was accused according to the article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code of the insults of Islam.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Really this affair takes her beginning in September when the teacher asks theirs 6 to seven-year-old pupil to select a name for the Klassenteddy.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Die children suggest eight names, under it Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed , reports headmaster Robert Boules.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the end when the class votes, 20 of 23 children Mohammed choose as the dearest given name.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Absolutely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a given name very frequent in Sudan.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Afterwards the children have provided a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the picture signature Mein name is Mohammed .</seg>
<seg id="11"> The bear itself carried no sign with this name, but the problem is quite easy that the representation of the Islamic prophet is looked as insults of Islam.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> One of the Moslem colleagues of Gillian Gibbons who informs at the same school in Sudan explained, he knows them well, and she would never have something would have acted with which she could step to a religious belief too near, ich regrets only that she has asked the children to be right for a name, on this occasion, , his opinion it concerns only a unschuldigen mistake .</seg>
<seg id="13"> An opinion which numerous pupils of the teacher divide who speaks this as sehr carefully towards her pupils  and as Person, never in the class about religion  describe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> One thinks that the given name Mohammed is at the same time also in Great Britain in the second most frequent given second name for which into English 14 different manners of writing exist.</seg>
<seg id="15"> This often from Moslem families well-chosen given name counts as a kind of deference to the prophet (he is often given to the first-born of a family).</seg>
<seg id="16"> But how are the rules concerning the use of this given name?</seg>
<seg id="17"> May one give him, for instance, to toys?</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> By the opening of the international peace conference which had assembled on Tuesday under his management in Annapolis, Maryland, president Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had agreed, finally, on a common explanation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> He further explained that Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin immediately with negotiations to find a final regulation of the 60 year-old disputes between her both people.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The boss of the White House stressed that the negotiations aim at a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinian authority under Abbas, after all, which should clear all open questions without exception, and including the central questions .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This name encloses three serious problems on which the disputes primarily turn between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the destiny of the Arabian refugees who were expelled in the course of the conflict of 1948 from her native country which lies in the today's state Israel.</seg>

<seg id="3"> A risqué climbing out which has achieved on account of his duration, the distance of inhabitable modules, the quickness with which he was organized and to carry out which from the astronauts gebastelten  tools, in order the repair several records.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The problem appeared on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the space shuttle Discovery, a big cylinder-shaped part which should soon take up the European and Japanese scientific labs.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This module is a kind of landing stage for the module labs.</seg>
<seg id="6"> But one must be able to supply them with stream.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It was the second task of the occupying, a 17.5 metric tons module to the stream production about solar collectors which was already on the International Space Station, to move to bring it in his final position.</seg>
<seg id="8"> After she had moved it, the occupying came along to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module whose span amounts to 76 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And, besides, it happened that one of the collectors which can be opened up like Akkordeone was damaged by a stuck cable on a length by chance to a meter</seg>
<seg id="10"> The restructuring was stopped not to damage the collector even more.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The astronauts who leave originally for a controlling way the space shuttle Discovery and then another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty should repair, felt constrained to devote itself to the damaged collector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> And Scott Parazynski was selected, at the end of the 30 meter long remote control arm of the space shuttle which had been attached in that of the station, to walk to carry out the repair.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He is one best Spacewalker  (Wetraumgänger) of the NASA.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Largely, resistantly, very much skillful, he has a well developed upper part of the body and long arms.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The 46-jähirige qualified doctor was selected, verletzten  solar collector to operieren .</seg>
<seg id="16"> After he had exactly examined the damages, he split the faulty cable and fastened a kind of rails on the damaged place.</seg>
<seg id="17"> He was supported from second Spacewalker  which remained near the sluice, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the occupying.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The tools which he used a mini-hockey stick, in insulator wraps to prevent an electric blow on the solar collectors which generate several hundred volts, the astronauts had thought up aboard the station and gebastelt .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited, until the collector was opened up completely, before he counted his tools and returned in the station.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Yesterday afternoon the astronauts half a day of relaxation enjoyed, before today seven astronauts on the space shuttle Discovery returned to start the return flight to the earth probably Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="3"> After a very bolted election campaign she confirms her striving for stability, even to Autoritarismus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Three days before the parliamentary elections Russian president Vladimir Putin directs news emitted on the public transmitters to the voters which was already taped, indeed whose contents are kept secret, nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He does this in his quality as a top candidate of combined Russia, the pro-Kremlin party for which an overpowering victory announces itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yesterday the president let nothing look though when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was content to deliver a new attack point against the west powers which are accused of the interference favorite subject during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Wir know the price of a truthful democracy and expect to us honest choices, extremely transparently and openly, choices without fraudulences , he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> From view of the opposition they have made a mistake there.</seg>
<seg id="9"> They prangert an election campaign stained by suppression.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says, there would have been niemals such dirty choices, not even in the time of Eltsin .</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> After these parliamentary elections without tension two much continuing questions set themselves up:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">  Who will start Putin succession as a president?</seg>
<seg id="15"> Yesterday the office newspaper has announced the date of the first ballot of the presidency choices, 2nd March, 2008; the candidates have to time 23rd December to announce themselves.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Because he was chosen in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot line up for the third mandate as a result of.</seg>
<seg id="17"> And now no successor is found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Which role will Putin play after March?</seg>
<seg id="19"> Prime minister?</seg>
<seg id="20"> Chairperson of the majority in parliament and the omnipotent party combined Russia which will select government and president?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Whatever it will be, by the parliament choices or by the presidency choices, the present power will triumph.</seg>
<seg id="22"> This is a tradition.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Die Russians have retained integrity the mentality of the homo Sovieticus, they are not man of her destiny , thinks sociologist Lev Goudkov, manager of the independent center Levada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the state university of Saint Petersburg goes back even even further: The middle-class society has only very slowly developed in this land which became five centuries after Europe christianisiert; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> After the liberal reforms of the 90s Putin has gone back to the model of a paternalistischen state again what was completely accepted by the population, the more, because no terror followed this new Paternalismus, but a certain economic prosperity, means Maria Lipman of the Carnegie endowment.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Today verzichten  the Russians aus to free pieces on the personal responsibility  which they have displayed after the decay of the USSR for a short time.</seg>

<seg id="28"> This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the business world.</seg>
<seg id="29"> And the administrative élite knows how to hold the status Quo: 65 governors (from 85 Russian region chairpersons) state the local electoral lists of combined Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The new freedoms coming from the west are often synonymous with chaos, how in the 90s.</seg>
<seg id="31"> The general public prefers stability.</seg>
<seg id="32"> In this sense the Russians will also not be right for the extremist parties.</seg>

<p>

<seg id="1"> Approach final year-Rally aheadies to the stock exchange? Disagreement with the experts on account of the US-mortgage crisis</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> With just five weeks up to the annual accounts on the stock exchange the investors already rub themselves the hands in view of the next final year-Rally.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The experts can still provide with respect to that no sure predictions.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Banif believes that rein looks statistically which walks along December on the stock exchange ordinarily with a positive market development</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is nevertheless advisable not to provide predictions at short notice and only on the basis of statistics. Above all not when tensions to be taken seriously determine the topical market events</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Although other experts do not favor such a strong course increase during the last weeks of the year, these still mark that der stock market course from given liquidity of the market and the market participants is determined. These invest on account of the lack of sure stock funds primarily in pension fund which is strongly concerned by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend to to assets rich in yield.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Therefore the stock exchange will show a rather lateral course trend influenced by market fluctuations according to opinion of these experts rather, vor to all because we cannot estimate yet the magnitudes of the possible decline of the interest rate of the US issuing bank, an insecurity above all on the risen crude oil price and the danger of the increase of the inflation rate is to be led back. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Javier Barrio, chairperson of the sales department with BPI in Spain, agrees with the fact that it is a risqué time to announce a forthcoming Markt-Rally.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Die chances do not stand very well , assures the expert.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Spanish share index Ibex has already lost since his Höchstmarke on the 8th November from 15,945.7 points a value of 4%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But not all experts divide the same negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In view of Juan Solana, analyst with Intermoney, could conclude the Ibex 35 as a result of the restructuring of the investment fund and the traditional, every year in this time carried out Bezuschussung of the pension fund, the year successfully with nearly 16,000 points.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The expert still emphasizes that this year the things could develop a little bit differently; above all on account of already in the second December week, and, therefore, directly after the bridge day by the day of the constitution, taking place final year-Rally.</seg>
<seg id="14"> In the opinion of the analyst the price fluctuations would not influence the market trends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> According to appraisal of Federico Olucha, analyst at bank Inversis, the present judgements are to the market position at a nearly technical level what could lead to it, dass itself soon a divergence from the index values could draw, magnitudes depended on the results of the US-mortgages market crisis.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The analyst trusts in the fact that these are positive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> With the choice of the values which should speed up the Ibex to new maxima the analysts agree.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Solana von Intermoney protests that dieses year the big values are in the row. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The expert would count two major banks and some real estate companies to the worth winners, da the stream sector at the given time will be too expensive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Meanwhile Federico Olucha of bank Inversis assures that the increases walk along in connection with the bank sector and industrial sector.</seg>

<seg id="3"> A total of 200 of it are settled in the economic-strongest regions of Spain.</seg>
<seg id="4"> For the institute which operates Max under the trade name Popular these establishments signify a big landmark.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But also dares for the remaining Spanish institutes, because Popular as the first bank group shows the jump to extend the opening times of his branches weekdays to 20.30h and to begin on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> Spanish private transmitter Telecinco doubles for the first time his stock market value and overtakes therefore his rival Antena 3.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Wir have created it. </seg>
<seg id="3"> With this sentence the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, with close of the stock market made known his contentment. The transmitter escorted by him had raised his value by double of his rival Antena 3.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless, an aspect damped his joy: Das is exactly that what me is injured; not that we a higher growth, but that we lower losses had , he found out.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He stressed that they have much too deeply sunk in spite of the weak market nicht. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yesterday Telecinco finished the day with a plus of 2.54%.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This profit diminishes his present this year's losses on 15.66%.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Now according to Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4,488.88 million euros and Mediaset controls the main interest of the capital (52%), and Vocento is involved only with 13%.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Yesterday rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percent points and has to announce since January a loss of a total of 40.5%, so that his market value with 2,193.46 millions amounts to half.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The market value of other listed communication-enterprises, however, rises; in case of from Sogecable on 3.571 millions, with Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) on 2,518.53 millions and with Vocento on 1.779 millions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it itself um two similar enterprises acts , according to Vasile.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Uncertainly still appears the question in which circumference we can operate really technically on the stock exchange for which price and how we can form it at customer level lucratively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Telecinco explained his plan one week ago to climb up this year to the first television broadcasting station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. Of this insured Guiseppe Tringali, the managers of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising enterprise of the group.</seg>
<seg id="14"> If the plan should be moved, the transmitter would increase his advertising income in comparison to the 965.4 millions from the year before on 3.6%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In the case of Antena 3 the net turnover rose by 1.6% during the first nine stock market months (up to 734.4 millions), while the Nettoeinkünfte from the television business could show only one increase of 0.7% (630.4 millions).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The analysts see the main factor for the stock market course better in the comparison of Telecinco with the high Payout-Ratio which the company could show up to the current time: In 2006 veranlasste the enterprise escorted by Alejandro Echevarría a 100-percent declaration of dividend.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Nevertheless, Vasile assures that the Ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Wir are obliged to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have bragged up to now always substantially more.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I hope that we can satisfy our stockholders this year whose stock values we could already increase by the purchase of 33% of the Endemol shares.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> At the moment after statement of the analysts the market shows certain loss trends.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Lehmann Brothers reduced only recently his profit calculation with Telecinco for this year about 4% and for 2009 about 7%.</seg>
<seg id="22"> This is the result of the shortening of the prospective increase rate which will go back in 2008 from 10.5% to 8.4% and in 2009 from 5.5% on 5.1%.</seg>
<seg id="23"> This has also lowered the prospective profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 about 4.5% and for 2009 about 7.5%.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Which assurance is suited for me best of all?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The KFZ assurance which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver contain a high expense whose height takes down rerum on different factors, among other things from age, gender, time of the production of the driving licence, marital status, kind of the car to be insured and his use, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A car is to be owned only the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Since the suitable KFZ assurance is to be found even difficult as the right vehicle model.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At first once must be clear to one with which we have to do it here.</seg>
<seg id="6"> A car insurance is an arrangement between an insurance society and a policy holder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This arrangement is held on in writing by means of a contract of insurance which fixes that the society receives the arranged insurance premium and is obliged as a countermove to present the suitable sum of indemnity with a case of damage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The insurance premium is the price of an assurance which consists by several factors, among other things age, gender, time of the production of the driving licence, marital status, kind of the vehicle to be insured or his use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The insurance enterprises settle her prices accordingly of the statistics, so that with a higher accident danger also higher contribution payments become due.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> That's why less contribution payments must perform about 25-year-old as well as women, because statistics prove that these groups show a lower accident rate thanks to her care.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The same also counts to married persons, because these incline after statement of the statistical values and, therefore, also after conviction of the enterprises, to less accidents like single.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The use which is attached to the vehicle impairs the frequency of the driving and with it also the likelyhood of an accident.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The more often the use, the more probably the damage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> By the installation of the premium the assurances must take into consideration a whole row of points.</seg>
<seg id="15"> That's why the driver must also study the situation thoroughly to select exactly the car insurance which meets his personal needs in the earliest one.</seg>
<seg id="16"> We list at this point now the most important points which one should consider with the choice of an assurance to be able to meet not only an achievement, but also a choice oriented to price.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Among 25-year-old hit with a choice of an inexpensive assurance on numerous obstacles, as for example the low driving practise and junge  driving licence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Even if it was the best for an ideal insurance cover to conclude a full fully comprehensive insurance, there are still less expensive alternatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The careful drivers can select a Vollkasko with deduction, so that the achievements of a full fully comprehensive insurance are covered, indeed, but are offered for a low price.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Of such type from contract contain that the customer must pay a part of the amount resulted by the damage himself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Der amount is fixed before end of the contract and with the help of the height of the insurance premium. This is higher the more slightly the sum to be paid , explains Luis Noguera, general agent of Spain with ridge Europe, to a mediation enterprise for on-line assurances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Another option is the enlarged assurance which insures of the customer against external accident damages, not, nevertheless, against the damages resulted in own car.</seg>
<seg id="23"> In addition, theft, fire and vehicle loss would cover of such type of the assurance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Here a council.</seg>
<seg id="25"> If you are 25 years old under, it lies in your hand to lower the insurance costs; thus your credit increases, while you try to go carefully and to avoid accidents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> A credit is a lowering of the base rate at the suitable insurance society.</seg>
<seg id="27"> On the contrary in addition contain a penal payment an increase of aforesaid rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Die height credits and penal payments depend on the society and their yields.</seg>
<seg id="29"> If the enterprise has a year rich in yield behind itself, it can allow itself to raise the bonus payments , explains Noguera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> As soon as the 25-annual brand is crossed, it is to be concluded for the drivers more simply a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practise the accident rate sinks.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Therefore it is the most sensible to decide on a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Normalerweise can pull the youngsters no use from her present experience, in case of an accident as well as at the time of the driving , does not explain the Spanish director of the European enterprise, and adds that the majority of the accidents occur in the second practise year, after Angst of the beginner  was filed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Still it is with a married customer who owns no children to conclude more advisable, a full fully comprehensive insurance; of course only if it also admits the financial situation of the suitable person.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> On the part of the insurers married couples with children count as the customers with the slightest accident rate, and accordingly low her contribution payments also fall out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> In this case a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction (with an amount about the 300 euros) would be the best option. In the case that one has received a high credit, an enlarged assurance which starts only to the third vehicle year is recommended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Sie go all together more relaxed and own a bigger purchasing power which allows to them to attach a higher contribution payment , ascertains Luis Noguera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> For pensioners it is obvious to conclude a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction (with an amount about the 150 euros), or an enlarged assurance which starts only with an enough high credit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> At last one must stick that the car insurance is something very important, not only because she protects the driver against possible accident damages, but also because she rescues high costs which require that a thorough choice is dripped which corresponds to our personal situation.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Everything still openly</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Mitt Romey said, he holds it of no presidential candidate worthy to be questioned by a snowman.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Nevertheless, the republican candidate agreed for the presidency, in the end to position himself to a debate on YouTube in which normal voters take up questions on video and submit to send them to the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="4"> None of the questions which were thrown up on the Wednesday evening, 28th November, were as ridiculous as the snowman, the democrats about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party conferred with.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time exactly the state of the republican party which opens in the choices next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It is not known, precise like the producers by CNN, which the debate to the cosupported ones which selected the beginning candidate YouTube to be shown clips.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, in the first half an hour of the debate which was dedicated longest to a single subject immigration stood in the center.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The subject is one of the most efficient subjects for Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="9"> A group of undecided voters asked the CNN to serve a Wählscheibe if they heard things which they liked: The television company noted points of the approval as the candidates strictly about the borders spoke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The most sharp and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner, and Romney who has pushed in the determining surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire forwards.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Giuliani tries to shake off the call, he has been compliantly concerning unlawful immigration when he was a mayor of New York.</seg>
<seg id="12"> He attacked Romney in he the former governor of Massachusetts accused, unlawful immigrants for work on his house to have put.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The both sat down especially violently apart as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates gave an "Amnestie" (the unlawful a regular status and the possibility on the citizenship) would support.</seg>
<seg id="14"> More unimportant candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressional representative, and Tom Tancredo, a congressional representative from Colorado, it succeeded with this subject nachzuhaken.</seg>
<seg id="15"> None of both men has serious chances with the nomination, but both remain in the running, maybe because they have lashed out earlier and harder than other on the immigration kettledrum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At least in the area of the immigration the candidates divide on the whole the same views: more sharp borders, intolerance towards unlawful migrants.</seg>
<seg id="17"> This subject, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other worries about the rest of the world, the differences help the Republicans between liberal and Christian conservative to forget or to minimize.</seg>
<seg id="18"> But the debate became unambiguously problematic as other subjects were brought up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Mr. Giuliani was asked, which is why he has supported weapon restrictions in the past.</seg>
<seg id="20"> John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be looked as a torture.</seg>
<seg id="21"> One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.</seg>
<seg id="22"> This led to the fact that Giuliani represented the point of view that although the Bible is his preferential book, he thinks the history of Jonah and the whale maybe not literal.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Another questioner asked whether of Jesus the capital punishment supported.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations on the first place in a recently carried out survey in Iowa thanks to his Christian Konservativismus existing for a long time - said that the capital punishment is painful, but necessary.</seg>
<seg id="25"> When he was pushed for whether of Jesus she would recommend, he laughed at it and said of Jesus was to be promoted too intelligently around himself around a political office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The running stays open extremely far.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Huckabees rise in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls to the latest donation success and his thunderous applauses in the debate of Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="28"> These both are sent up from Nothing because both wings of the party could not agree up to now yet on one of the more known and more traditional candidates.</seg>
<seg id="29"> In 1980 and 2000 a candidate has the party from the outset and persuasive combinedly with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink to both wings of the party.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Pains of the Labour party</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Gordon Brown has discovered still an other pit to the Hineinfallen; his way from this remains the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> For British scandals this is not especially slippery.</seg>
<seg id="4"> No titles of nobility seem to have been sucked sold, politician's Paris hotel calculations paid-uply, no illegitimate toes.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But the disclosure that a rich businessman has veiled donations for the British ruling Labour party about more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) more than four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to announce this is something without the fought Gordon Brown would have well got by.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When two months ago the Prime Minister had avoided the demand for a choice, in stupid way the intelligence of the Britons insulting, while he stated that opinion polls had not influenced this decision there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Instead, like Vince Cable who expressed keen representation chairperson of the Liberally democrats, it in increasing litre of beer the once dreaded Brown of Stalin has developed to Mr. Bean.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The clumsy rescue of Northern rock, a groggy bank, showed regulatorische weakness and bad judgment property under bombardment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Badly thought-out suggestions for the change of the tax laws have raised enterprise federations against the government.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The tax-official loss of personal data of 25 million people indicated inconceivable administrative botch-ups.</seg>
<seg id="11"> A trio of generals in the retirement started to an uprising in the Upper House in protest against shortenings of military expenses: To be a minister of the armed forces, they stated, is a part-time job.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Now there are the varied donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labours secretary general (and her earlier fulfilment leader) has already withdrawn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Nothing means of the fact that Brown opens definitely in the direction of exit.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Governments can still reach a turning point, after they it feel impossibly to rule.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Neither may trust nor people to politicians, hold back, however, them ordinarily her scepticism if a new troop seizes the office.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If it is clear once that it is unlikely that a prime minister improves the situation, and he does not need to be present yet long, this deferment is over: the civil service starts to become leaking; the cabinet ministers start to chat; the press looks for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In a way the position of Brown is especially difficult because it cannot claim in contrast to other political leaders to be a new broom.</seg>
<seg id="18"> So with pleasure he would deny Tony Blair, he was his first lieutenant.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The problems with Northern to rock and the tax competence documents, for example, hang together with decisions which Brown met as a chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And even if was involved not directly in Blair's bad luck - as with the long " money for title of nobility " investigation of political party financing - the voters possibly assume from the fact that he was it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Nevertheless, Browns position is not so bad completely as it looks</seg>
<seg id="22"> The misdemeanours are not so awful as the conservatives describe them.</seg>
<seg id="23"> As with Mr. Bean, nobody has died, or was totally swindled out.</seg>
<seg id="24"> And the antidote, painfully how it may be is to be delivered what Browns have always promised of course Stalinist trends: A reliable, respectable and slightly crude government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The new fuss around political donations is a good example.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Garboeske Abrahams which compares his donations to his charitable gifts says he wishes no public recognition for his goodwill.</seg>
<seg id="27"> This may be maybe like that, but the decision on it was not entitled to him.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The laws against anonymity for big political contribution payers are clear and they exist for unequivocal reason: the general public has a right on to know who can buy itself access to those which govern the land.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Watts, that says he would have known about Abrahams arrangement, but not that she is unlawful, will have to position itself naturally of some questions; exactly like Jon Mendlesohn, Labours Hauptfinanzeintreiber whom about the odd donations was told in October.</seg>
<seg id="30"> However, up to now Brown is not involved: There is nothing that points to the fact that he knew about this confusion, although the biggest part of the payments was done after his office takeover in June.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Up to now the prime minister has done half of the work.</seg>
<seg id="32"> He has condemned fast the injury of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by the griffins after a known instrument, has led to an investigating committee on the subject - to fill the measure, from a bishop in the retirement and a judge.</seg>
<seg id="33"> In this case the " apprenticeships to be pulled from it " are not complicated very much.</seg>
<seg id="34"> If the law was broken, it is a thing for the police.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Apart from the fact there are other things Mr. Brown must do to find how a little bit one permanent chairpersons for the independent committee for standards in the public life which is unoccupied since six months and to progress with a drastic reform of political party financing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> This would require from the hard liners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and to give up, perhaps, the special financial respect with the trade unions - the bitter pills for a party member like Mr. Brown.</seg>
<seg id="37"> But he should be aware of some biased facts.</seg>
<seg id="38"> Now the conservatives have a clear guidance in the opinion polls; he has to win back two years around voters; and the only way, as he can reach a victory, is by indisputable righteousness and respectable competence.</seg>

<seg id="6"> Signs of the strain are clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="7"> There are increases by the writing offs as well as with the default rates which measure the interest of the loans which are not retractable in each case or too late more than 30 days.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The HSBC has announced last month that it has taken 1.4 billion dollars of fee elevation from her American consumer's financing, partially because of the weakness of credit card takers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It is still too early to go to ruin in panic.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Losses and defaults are still low.</seg>
<seg id="11"> According to rating agency Moody the third quarter-default rate of 3.89% nearly a full percent point was under the historical average.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The deterioration with the rates can be explained partly by technical factors.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A change in the American private insolvency right laws in 2005 led to a sudden case of declarations of bankruptcy which put out again for a big part of the Keditkartenverluste; the number of the registrations (and with it default fees) would rise again whether the general conditions on applicant for the credit get worse or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The industry also reports about respectable payment rates which point how much from her debts the consumers every month pay off</seg>
<seg id="15"> and the trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, in spite of the shutdown in other corners of the structured financing.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> There are direct infection canals between the real estates loan crisis and the credit card market absolutely: it is more likely that consumers take up credit card debts, now that own home loans dry up.</seg>
<seg id="18"> However, the map exhibitors look at the monetary river instead of on capital values, therefore, falling house prices do not release necessarily a change in the creditworthiness of the applicant for the credit.</seg>
<seg id="19"> They can be an advantage even for the map exhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The incentive sink for consumers to pay furthermore the mortgage rates if the real estates are less value than the value of the advance; as a result the map debts under the repayment priorities become more important.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Map exhibitors can also react much faster and more adaptably than credit grantor to the stormier conditions, while they change interest rates or loan borders.</seg>
<seg id="22"> This should reduce theoretically the risk of a quick new assessment of the assets.</seg>
<seg id="23"> " We will wake of no day and revalue the advances completely ", says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones main finance adviser.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24"> Even if a sudden untercover crisis is unlikely in the credit card market, the risks of a lasting recession are considerably more real.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yesterday the stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantiks, after market hopes that the central bank will will try to calm the loan markets by other lowerings of interest rates were encouraged by appeasing comments of the vice chairperson of the US central bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The stock markets rose in London, New York and in whole Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairperson of the central bank, said that the policy must react " adaptably and pragmatically " to the persistent pressure at the finance markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In a clear effort to calm verdrießliche markets, at the sight of sign of ambitious loan tensions, said Kohn, the latest turbulence would have turned back " partially some of the improvement of the market functions of the late part of September and Octobers ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Should the raised turbulence continue, it would raise the possibility of an other increase of the financial conditions on consumer and enterprise, he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready, to intervene and to stabilize markets and possible other lowerings of interest rates the loan terms with new capital sputter in the US.</seg>

<seg id="1"> England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Here two dilemmas, each of it almost as difficultly as the other.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Who should hit as a number 6 for England in Kandy on this week-end, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?</seg>
<seg id="4"> And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka who should meet the decision?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral chairperson, on call is at least under this special title, here to decide to help of coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan in it, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing manager, bit by bit with applications fills for national electoral offices, if not even for which in partial time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Whoever the sixth racquet position does not agree, will be unhappy, but the life is often unfair and the sport is indubitable it.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It is never easy, precise to nail what enables a person to reach the point of his branch of profession, while not everyone never comes out about the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of luck instead of ability.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is not only in the cricket where the choice is difficult where judgments are necessary which are subjective always at the end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Is it to be climbed up the right time for Bopara?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Is it fair to Shah if he acts?</seg>
<seg id="11"> The same one can be asked maybe also in another area whether, for instance, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both the intelligent young executives should be carried with good end which know the business well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Who can say what is the right class for a cricketer, unless, to him the possibility is given, to swim or to set.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Naturally figures have a big influence on decisions, but chances also have this.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Within a team a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain at the right time if he can take a Wicket and a racquet must get regular chances on the order if he wants to do impression as a one-day cricketer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> To catch the eyes of the Auswähler is more complex.</seg>
<seg id="16"> There were many, which in the last season better than, for example, when James Anderson were who will apparently play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explains himself for healthy and how the wind bowls in the nets.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Anderson took 32 high-class Wickets with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Chris Tremlett took only 29 by the same modest average, but both had her highlights and hope on even more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Whether Shah or Bopara in the Asgiriya stage plays, only one view question can be.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it does maybe, nevertheless, little difference.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, nevertheless, with five Wickets and runs with 40 useful, it was Paul Collingwood to strengthen at that time still fighting around himself which created the breakthrough to a significant test cricketer and who, although he dotted a double Hundred against Australia in Australia, is maybe still underestimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and moor, after an other discussion in the course of the today's net meeting in the Asgiriya stage will follow her conservative instincts and belly feeling for Shahs bigger experience about Boparas youthful enthusiasm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> There are arguments for both.</seg>
<seg id="24"> For Shah his sparkling and valuable 88 Test-Debüt-Innings speaks in Bombay, 43 high-class hundreds and only six of Bopara which is younger at the age of 22 years seven years and an excellent balance against turned on balls.</seg>
<seg id="25"> But Shah did only ten runs in his two Innings in the May against west Indies in the test in lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate refusal of the Auswählern was healthy as a Vaughan to take back his position for the next play, seems to have taken the swing from his hitting which was still evident in Bombay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> By contrast the Alleskönner from Essex has shovel-wise joy of life.</seg>
<seg id="27"> He is impressed by nothing on a cricket place and his posture apart of it was summed up when he had recently skipped a vehicle with 4-bicycle impulse in an exhibit for sponsor of England Volkswagen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> He suffered smaller injuries and presumably a shock, but the first what he did, his Vodafone (of course also gesponsort) was to be got out and to call his team colleague Alastair Cook who had observed this from a distance and to say with enthusiasm: " Have you seen this? ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Bopara is a lot of better player, he bowls his middle tempo with some effect here on the fields what seems to fit to him and hits with confidence and talent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The right man is to be chosen a thing to choose the right time another.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Maybe this is the real art of the choice.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Now I bend to it Bopara to give his chance what does not mean that, nevertheless, Shah will not well maybe stand there if, as the tea sentence from Ceylon suggests, he is that which will play here this week-end.</seg>

<seg id="6"> " Today I came back, because of that what I have seen on television and what I have read in the newspaper, about that what has happened in Bagdad, and how it would be sure now. "</seg>
<seg id="7"> They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people ", he said, in relation on the Schiitenmilizen of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, has ordered to put back his forces at the current time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the prevailing sunnitische part of Amariyah, returned with his both children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because to work the regime Iraqi not permissibly.</seg>
<seg id="9"> His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to say to him that a local militia supported by the USA has served to expel al-Qaeda from her bastion in the west of the capital, and penetrated him to the return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader sunnitischen and Shiite trunk which had been expelled from his house in Sleikh in the north of Bagdad by an attack with grenades, after he had requested his fellow citizens to the fight Al-Qaidas.</seg>
<seg id="11"> He was come back to fight.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="12"> " Two days ago some of my friends called me and said to me that they began one the Anti-Al-Qaida-Miliz in Sleikh and that they need my support and which of my boys.</seg>
<seg id="13"> This is why I have returned today ", said Sabaah aluminum Obeidi, 62.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Many told that they had been lured by the increasing rest in the capital since the US-troop rise and the growth more locally " groups of members of the public aggrieved by the proposal " which arms and in collaboration with the American military her town quarters defend.</seg>
<seg id="15"> But more spoke of having been forced home by visa problems and drying up finances in Damascus where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled during the last years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old triple father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, the Syrian government had requested to cover visa restrictions for the refugees to force people to the return.</seg>
<seg id="17"> More than 2,5 million people have presumably fled from the sectarian Todesschwadronen in the land.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> " It well went for us to al-Maliki Syria visited and the government urged to the Iraqis no more visas to give to force them to the return in Iraq ", said of the sunnitischen pensioners.</seg>
<seg id="19"> " I cannot trust to a government which supports the criminals, my house of burned down ones, after I left. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A part of the reason for the decline of the power is that Sunniten from Shiite residential areas and vice versa were expelled what led to the creation of many places where tensions have decreased.</seg>
<seg id="21"> There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will poke sectarian tensions again and it will come to conflicts.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="15"> In spite of the practically oriented education and rising inquiry the number of the engineer's graduates has sunk during the past years, nevertheless, by a third.</seg>

<seg id="20"> Whether the achievements of the pupils improve with lasting effect, only future comparative studies will point.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Near Pisa in 2003 shrank the interest of the risk pupils from 29 to 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Nevertheless, all together Saarland increased not so strongly as other federal states.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The Bavarians better count.</seg>
<seg id="24"> And to the frustration of the Saarlanders Fremdsprachenkenntnise are not measured near Pisa - otherwise, in this area one could score.</seg>

<seg id="7"> Today there might be on the surface of the Venus barely something living: The atmosphere is thicker about hundred times than on the earth, there rule every now and then temperatures of 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="8"> " The Venus is maybe the devil's twin of the earth, but she is a twin ", said Russian</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Why the Venus which is so similar to the earth in mass and size has hit such a totally other development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The start of " Venus of express train " in November, 2005 was a landmark for the Venus research, because since beginning of the nineties no more probe was on the move specially to the investigation of this planet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The newest research results which are introduced now in several "Nature" articles underline in the opinion of the researchers not only the uniqueness of the Venus within the solar system.</seg>
<seg id="12"> " You also show that the common characteristics of our neighbouring planet with the earth are bigger than at first accepted ", informs the Esa.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Thus the researchers also found a cloud whirlpool in the South Pole which still turns substantially faster beside the already known whirlwind on the North Pole.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The phenomenon reminds of airflows on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni about the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The most second-internal planet of the solar system has almost the same mass like the earth and is big with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers almost just.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The planet also called morning or evening star circles in just 225 days round the sun.</seg>
<seg id="17"> However, he turns much more slowly on himself: A Venus day lasts 243 earth days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees centigrade and a pressure of 92 reminds cash barely of the earth, scientists assume from the fact that both planets have originated under quite similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="19"> On both water collected which remained on the earth in oceans, however, on the Venus got lost in the space.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And while carbon dioxide on the earth is fixed in carbonate rocks, it puts out on the Venus the large part of the atmosphere.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The fathers of the herbal rock return</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Supergroup of Germany of the seventy-year-olds makes music again: Three tape members of Harmonia planned for her consoles with a concert in Berlin once more.</seg>
<seg id="3"> To the revival a recording from her big time " appears Live in 1974 ".</seg>
<seg id="4"> Even then they were substantially more famous abroad.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Then the fixed sensation occurs in the form of three sedate men in the evening board.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Everybody has his small box before itself, his cables and above all his buttons.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Dieter Moebius sits enthroned in the snow-white shirt at the age of 63 years in the middle.</seg>
<seg id="8"> On the left flanks from Michael Rother, 57 years young and in the possession of laptop and guitar.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the right, from the lecture hall looks, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 curves, concentrates in the console.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Everybody contributes noises, every now and then even a beat.</seg>
<seg id="11"> And sometimes it submits by mistake to a customary piece of music.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Then this also seems to disturb men even not largely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The fact that the volume Harmonia makes music again, has provided among herbal rock-lovers for some excitement.</seg>
<seg id="14"> And one may reveal here: Specific inquiries proved that the name whirred, indeed, through the collective pop memory, but by no means so with lasting effect to miss this tape for 32 years painfully.</seg>
<seg id="15"> But why should the German not be allowed to celebrate also his living legends from the seventies?</seg>
<seg id="16"> Particularly as that what calls delusively herbal rock, counted in England and America always more than in own land.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> When the music economy lent to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003 the echo price of life work, one saw in the hall in questioning German pop faces.</seg>
<seg id="18"> As the Red Hot chilli Peppers to itself in the eulogy still with the volume La Dusseldorf and Anew! thanked, the surprise knew no borders.</seg>
<seg id="19"> With concerts Michael Rother crouched later with the Red Hot chilli Peppers on the stage like an old pal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Away from home that is the problem of the ignorance at home and the transfiguration one.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The memory is demanded too much if only for that with Harmonia because the trio only two years existed and unfolded in this time also a far lower effect power than them afterwards from others was assigned.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler already before under the promising name Cluster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> At first one played in the cellar under the Berlin show stage.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Afterwards in Dusseldorf, for economic reasons for one flat label maintained by the church.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Rother had briefly helped out with power station and afterwards as a guitarist with Anew!, the German group most radical maybe at that time, a call wins.</seg>
<seg id="26"> However, about 1973 Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile after forest in the Weser mountainous country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> There, in the old Weser court, ruins from the 16-th century, they lived as a town-brief Kommunarden.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Less ideologically than in the local authority district I where might slave Roedelius still as a nanny.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Rather in spitzweghaftem artist's existence.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Supposedly a pennon of the song association Harmonia Ottenstein and for the art a name was also found in the bulky refuse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Something held on Harmonia of it.</seg>
<seg id="32"> The first album called " music of Harmonia " and the following "De Luxe".</seg>
<seg id="33"> Since thus let and give the music also sounded, the tape suffered material need.</seg>
<seg id="34"> The brushwood collecting served not only the Selbstfindung.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The CD appeared now " Live in 1974 " was recorded with a concert in Griessem, before a just 50-headed record scenery, as somebody believes to remember.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> At that time from Rother came the wish to force Harmonia and to practice now and then.</seg>
<seg id="37"> For Roedelius and Moebius an indecent demand.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The tape explained in 1975 her separation.</seg>
<seg id="39"> Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and protected itself his existence with albums like " blazing hearts ".</seg>
<seg id="40"> Cluster was animated in the eighties again and is more successful since that time than it was Harmonia ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> The Griessemer live album is to be owed to Herbert Grönemeyer.</seg>
<seg id="42"> His record company Greenland has sat down it to the purpose to maintain the herbal rock as a very own German contribution to the living music.</seg>
<seg id="43"> Anew! besides, it was already dug out like Roedelius solo work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world.</seg>
<seg id="45"> Publicly subsidized, within the scope of the festival Woldtronics.</seg>
<seg id="46"> Julian Cope is there, the Briton, old punk and author of the manual " herbal rock of sampler ".</seg>
<seg id="47"> There the Love Parade inventor Dr. is also a moth.</seg>
<seg id="48"> With which the whole range of the influence of the herbal rock on the following pop music would be outlined.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Besides, the empty place of the supergroup is filled by Harmonia.</seg>
<seg id="50"> The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most strange sounds in the hall: " The only true music, you hear the future. "</seg>
<seg id="51"> There are pictures which show the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse parlour.</seg>
<seg id="52"> Projections of other black-and-white photos of chaotically cabled tools serve the laying education.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> Before it three veterans are occupied with the improvisation again.</seg>
<seg id="54"> No more, while they stick microphones to the organ and in the percussion to draw incredible tones of the instruments over self-tinkered effect devices.</seg>
<seg id="55"> Today the electronic music looks like electronic music.</seg>
<seg id="56"> Three tinkerers detailed in the technical.</seg>
<seg id="57"> The choir of the house also changes nothing in it.</seg>
<seg id="58"> Under the management of Barbara Morgensterns it is coughed under sound clouds and is whispered and at a nice place with emphasis " Aaaaaaaah! " chanted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> Herbal rock was always a very English concept.</seg>
<seg id="60"> It never concerned rock.</seg>
<seg id="61"> The roots were searched less in blues, than in colleges of music (Can), technologies (power station) or on the run before artistic and social conventions (cluster).</seg>
<seg id="62"> Who here " in '68! " shouts, is not wrong completely, and Harmonia can be brought by it also now not from the rest.</seg>
<seg id="63"> Still the most natural is roofed on the stage thoroughly.</seg>
<seg id="64"> Where does music start and when does it stop?</seg>
<seg id="65"> This can rob one of the nerves or give brief moments of big luck.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Richard Gere is not simply cynical enough</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Two films with the Balkan war deal with " The Hunting of party " and " of murderous peace " again.</seg>
<seg id="3"> However, both are not convincing.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Either the drafts place too much on action and Geballer or, however, them are too soppy.</seg>
<seg id="5"> There Richard Gere can also not help in " The Hunting of party ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The good news first: Indeed, the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but just there, now in the sombre hinterland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere has been found again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> We had lost the nicest man of the eighties years last out of sight because much too many nice-insignificant roles drove out the desire for glance in films for good sensations for women and much too many press conferences on the subject Buddhism to one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, himself " The Hunting party - If the hunter becomes the hunted " (Why must film titles be so long today, actually, always and be weird like train driver's wage agreements?) to consider maybe, nevertheless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He delivers a wonderfully winking representation: Basically his war reporter Simon Hunt is that what could have become from Gere if the destiny and the film branch were not so merciful: A man who has his very best times long behind himself which has still preserved substantial rests of the former charm, however, itself as the monument same to ruins of his decline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But in spite of this trump " The Hunting of party " continues only the endless row of failed Balkan war-films together with the German production " of murderous peace " which likewise starts this week.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> With " murderous peace " one can do short process: The film acts from two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian before kosovarischen sniper on which to itself one falls in love promptly still in them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although it is welcome that here once the Serbians are not shown as a sole root all evil, the television-level film loses itself much too fast in Geballer and action.</seg>
<seg id="13"> There remains a kind " alarm for Cobra 11 " without highway, however, for it with war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Against it can be investigated in " The Hunting of party " virtually exemplarily, why there has never been, actually, a really good Balkans-war film.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The history of three US-war reporters who start to track down the Serbian upper war criminal " the fox " could have become with another director and another scriptwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard) another time maybe new "Apocalypse Now".</seg>
<seg id="16"> Since the stories are similar remarkably: Both times go small teams to the wood to accomplish something what the military cannot do and both times it becomes a trip in the insanity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> One of the reasons for the failure of " The Hunting of party " is that one does not allow to be Simon Hunt simply the dilapidated cynic with heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18"> No, the Script must still impute a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin to him in addition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Finally " The Hunting of party " goes brook under it when the reporters within the last five minutes in the time-lapse photography procedure manage this what Nato, CIA and all reward hunters of the world have not created in five years: The war criminal catch and leave to the Muslim Bosnians to the fair revenge.</seg>
<seg id="20"> This is so bad that one would like to call the international court of law in Hague because of crimes against the film logic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Besides, the film has a profoundly human concern.</seg>
<seg id="22"> He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic walk around still freely, and he suspects the Americans and here the French (should agree they exceptionally sometimes) to pursue the pursuit on account of confidential political arrangements not too intensely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But the well meant and this Nastily are sometimes so similar to themselves that to one a famous Brecht's poem comes to the sense.</seg>
<seg id="24"> In it one says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the working table of the poet: " Compassionately I see the swollen forehead veins, suggestive: how exerting it is to be angry ".</seg>
<seg id="25"> Films like " The Hunting of party " have exactly such Schwellköpfe which indicate, however, how exerting it is to be good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Recently is in this newspaper reports become that all Iraq films of Hollywood were big flops.</seg>
<seg id="28"> One can add: There has never still been a good South Africa film.</seg>

<seg id="1"> From Beust criticism harvests for Olympia-Absage</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Moving away the mayor of the application of Hamburg for Olympic summer plays has bumped with policy and economy into violent criticism.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Many further want to fight for the plays in the water.</seg>
<seg id="4"> However, from Beust realism sends a reminder by the appraisal of the chances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The general manager of the chamber of commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called on Wednesday a renunciation as " not well for the economic location ".</seg>
<seg id="6"> No other project has recently unfolded so big motivation forces in the town like the Olympic idea.</seg>
<seg id="7"> " Without this purpose the sports-political swing would not be able to be maintained in the same litre of beer. "</seg>
<seg id="8"> Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate not to bury the project, but to find for it a new long-term beginning, " that goes out from a changed time ray ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements after which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are unrealistic at least up to 2028.</seg>
<seg id="10"> " Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic sports alliance ", said from Beust WELT online.</seg>
<seg id="11"> He referred to the decision expected for beginning of December of the sports alliance about an application of Munich for the Winter Olympics in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="12"> " This preference means for us that we will have no realistic chances in the period angedachten up to now from us till 2028. "</seg>
<seg id="13"> The dream is not still for all time ausgeträumt, said from Beust.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Hamburg sports alliance (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The impression is thereby woken that Hamburg wants to apply during the next 25 years no more for Olympic games.</seg>
<seg id="16"> " It is too early to obstruct a chance to themselves, while one buries the plans already at that time ", said HSB president Günter Ploss on Wednesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Besides, a renunciation of the application stands in the contradiction to the statement of the senate boss on the occasion of a receipt to the plenary assembly of the general German university sport federation.</seg>
<seg id="18"> There the application of Hamburg has not called from Beust for the Universiade in 2015 " substitute " with Olympic games in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The university sport federation had nominated only last week Hamburg as an applicant's town.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The SPD-citizens faction accused the senate of not having used valuable time for the house building in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="21"> " For years the development of the small Grasbrooks has been delayed by the senate because he has placed on the map Olympia and has ignored the house building ", said SPD-delegated Carola Veit and Jan Quast.</seg>
<seg id="22"> While SPD has always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later residential use for the small Grasbrook, the CDP has placed unilaterally on the "event factor".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The application for the Olympic summer plays in 2012 had released in Hamburg at that time a big enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="24"> However, Hamburg had failed because of Leipzig.</seg>

<seg id="1"> These are not Warhol's boxes</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Or, nevertheless?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Nowadays produced wooden boxes throw in Sweden dark shades on Warhol's work list.</seg>
<seg id="5"> A large part 94 Brillo boxing listed there of the " type Stockholm " are forgeries.</seg>
<seg id="6"> After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" has poked doubt about the genuineness of Andy's Warhol Brillo boxing of 1968 some months ago, internal investigations come in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now to a sobering result: Six "Brillo boxes" which former museum manager Pontus Hultén has left the Moderna Museet in 1995 as a donation are copies - and probably also the large part about hundred other Brillo boxing of the " type Stockholm " which are at the international art market in circulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The prehistory is interlaced, a bewildering concatenation of artistic and kuratorischer productions.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes", painted wooden boxes which are based on the red blue-white design of the cartons of the soap powder "Brillo" in New York.</seg>
<seg id="9"> An exhibit of his works in the Moderna Museet in 1968 issued - by Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard: These came (for cost reasons) not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo board mill.</seg>
<seg id="10"> It concerned not pieces of art, but their models, around bare exhibit pieces.</seg>
<seg id="11"> At the same time Warhol has given in 1968 probably the permission to let produce some Brillo-wooden boxes in Sweden which were not issued, however, in the Moderna Museet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Now contemporary witnesses speak of about fifteen boxes which have come " type Stockholm " rightly into the art and auction history at that time as an authorized Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Some of them have achieved on auctions more than 100,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Now the problem is that legendary museum manager Pontus Hultén has stated later falsely, about hundred wooden boxes have been produced in 1968 in Sweden and have been issued which leave Warhol to him then has.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Really Hulténs 105 boxes were produced only in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibit in St. Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="16"> At that time Warhol was already dead three years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Lars Byström, Chefkonservator in the Moderna Museet, has examined beside six Brillo boxes belonging to museum also three from Swedish private property by which two were made in 1968 in Stockholm: Their pressboard records were only undercoated and sanded down, then white oil paint with a paintbrush was applied.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The structure of the copies from the year 1990 against the fact betrays that the color with a painter's role was applied without priming directly on the pressboard record - in addition, it concerns not oil paint, but acrylic color.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> " These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy's Warhol Brillo boxes ", the manager of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve lets announce: " If 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' does not come in New York to another end, the Moderna Museet will class six boxes in his collection as copies / exhibit material. "</seg>
<seg id="20"> Already in July, admittedly, the Authentication Board has announced to follow the " heavy accusations " which are raised in the matter of the soap powder boxes.</seg>
<seg id="21"> However, since that time one wraps himself there in relentless silence.</seg>
