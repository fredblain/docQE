Richard Gere is not cynical enough simply 
Again two films with the Balkans war occupy themselves with "The Hunting party" and "murrderous peace". 
However do not both convince. 
Either the concepts set to Action too much and Geballer or else they are too stirring blessed. 
There even Richard Gere can not help in "The Hunting party". 
The good report at first: To be sure the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, however calculated there, in the gloomy rear country of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere was now found again. 
We had lost the nicest man of the eighty years finally from the eyes because all too many kind unimportant roles drove from one in well feeling films for women and all too many press conferences on the subject Buddhism as if desire for looking at. 
Now Richard Gere is sudden the most important argument, "The Hunting party - Wenn the hunter" perhaps however "becomes" to look at (film titles must be Warum really always so long today and wirr as locomotive leader tariff contracts) "to the hunted". 
.
However in spite of this Trumpfes, "The Hunting party" continues only the endless series of failed Balkans war films together with the German production of "murrderous peaces" which start in this week as well. 
With "murrderous peace," one can make short process: The film deals with two German soldiers in the Kosovo (Adrian Topol, max. Riemelt) which saves a Serbian from kosovarischen snipers, would which this also still falls in love one with them promptly. 
.
It however for that remains a type of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway with war. 
On the other hand, can be investigated exemplarily at "The Hunting party" absolutely why there was never yet a correctly good Balkans war film really. 
The story of three US war reporters who set out in order to track down the Serbian upper war criminal "the fox" could perhaps have become a new "Apocalypse Now" another time with another director and another Drehbuchautor (both in personnel union Richard Shepard). 
For the Storys are alike yes frappierend: Small teams go both times into the forest in order to accomplish something, which the soldiers and for both times it becomes a journey into the insanity. 
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting party" is that one is not Simon Hunt not simply the descended cynic with heart, he we are presented as this at the beginning. 
No, the Script must attribute obendrein to him another romantic affair with a muslimischen Bosnian murdered later. 
Finally "The Hunting party" goes the brook runter at the time when is successful for the reporters within the last five minutes in the Zeitrafferverfahren that, which Nato, CIA and all head money hunter of the world did not manage in five years: Catch the war criminal and leave the muslimischen Bosnians him for the just revenge. 
That is so bad that one would like to call the international court of justice in the Haag because of crimes against movie theater logic. 
The film has a deeply human request. 
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still rum run freely and he suspects the Americans and not to operate the Frenchmen (they should times be united here as an exception) the pursuit all too intensively as a result of secret political agreements. 
However the well meant and the bad one are sometimes so similar to himself that a famous Brecht poem comes for one into the sense. 
.
Films such as "The Hunting party" have exactly such swelling heads which however indicate how exerting it is to be good. 
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkans war film. 
Become is reports recently in this newspaper that all Iraq films were Hollywoods large Flops. 
One can add: There was never yet as well a good South Africa film. 
Is almost always valid: If a cataract is hung around on the crisis ranges or mine fields of the world, then something like that as goes "Rangoon" this out with Patricia Arquette, "beyond of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio. 
Possibly, all the conflicts are still too specific simply within a given time. 
Decades in any case had to pass it before Hollywood with "Schindlers list" was able to shoot a good film via the Holocaust. 
Some film will probably still ripen - the Vietnam plants "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal suit coat" considered a classic author now were celebrated seinerzeit of yes by no means einhellig as masterpieces. 
However perhaps we know today where every mass murder in real-time comes two screens to immediately home, also simple too much over the conflicts of the world. 
And that robs the Drehbuchschreibern the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs it in order to tell good stories. 
"Are or nothingness" or "the large dictator" finally therefore as well became yes so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how badly the Nazi regime reigned really. 
Perhaps, one may not be if one wants to make good films. 
Perhaps, one must have the sarkastisch disassociated artist look of the Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk. 
When this was asked for "dictionary" and the Balkans war to parallels between its historical novel "Lempri√®res", he answered: "That is only because some things never change." 
Cities will always be awfully dangerous, people will always be murdered in ghastly way and war in Yugoslavia herrschen." always becomes
