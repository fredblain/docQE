"It appears up to now that we will cross the border of a trillion crowns thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year possibly first in year 2009." 
Next year the debts should move crowns between 900 billion and a trillion, "said David Marek, analysts of the Patria Finance, server iHNed.cz."

Debts grow 
The state debt comes from the debts of the state government and comes above all from the accumulation of deficits of the state household. 
The state debt is financed by treasure instructions, state debt orders, direct loans or, for example, by loans of the European investment bank.

It is interesting that the growth is to be recorded above all with the debt orders where increment 20 amounts to percent. 
It is bad that the debts climb but on the other hand this shows that one can undertake something, already before the pension reform comes, "commented on Pikora the data."

This amount comes above all from the state budget deficit which will reach 76 billion crowns obviously this year instead of the estimated 91,3 billion. 
A ten-billion reserve for paying the pensions concerns it at most planned means for the consolidation agency in height of 13,3 billion crowns further, the financing of Staatsschuldverschreibungen for 43 billion and about installment for the loans at the European investment bank in height of 1,8 billion.
