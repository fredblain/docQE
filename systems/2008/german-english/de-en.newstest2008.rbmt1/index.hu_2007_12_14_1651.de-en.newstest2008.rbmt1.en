In many cases one saves at disinfectants 
.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the practising inheritance placing of the beds, the overloading of personnel - everything factors which are not precisely zuträglich for the damming of the infections, so the leading doctor of the national Epidemiologiezentrums. 
In many cases one saves in the case of the disinfectants as well. 
In the Traumatologie department of the János hospital, a MRSA infection was diagnosed recently. 
That against antibiotic resistente bacterium was found in a male patient who was delivered to the hospital after a serious accident. 
The patient was insulated. 
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here. 
.
Until 10. December of this year, infections initiated by multiresistente virus were reported from hospitals 1094 at the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system, so the leading doctor of the national Epidemiologiezentrums, Karolina Böröcz. 
Infections initiated by multiresistente virus were therefore registered so much, in the hospitals for certain, the true figure might however be higher. 
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, that against Methicillin Oxacillin resistenten Staphylococcus aureus. 
.
Sa limited infections (sore throat, tonsillitis, ignitions of the skin or wounds as for example) usually react well to antibiotics, they are heilbar well. 
If the means are however measured out too high or used inexpertly, respondierenden bacteria antibiotic resistente which spread out in the hospitals quickly under corresponding conditions result from that well. 
In the case of patients with weakened or durably badly functioning immune systems, but also at age or patients with small body weight can cause these bacteria difficult infections, as for example wound infection or blood poisoning, therefore sepsis. 
The MRSA infection is belongs nothing special, such occurrences for the medical director according to of the János hospital, to the Krankehausalltag. 
One may confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi - there is not only MRSA there where it is not looked for. 
Resistent against antibiotics 
"Such patients are insulated, the maintenance personnel Gummihandschuhe and masks carry with the supply and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - Tibor Nyulasi so. 
.
Test takings too rare 
The majority of the infections initiated by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, however the currently reigning conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the Eindämmung of the arising or the expansion of the multiresistenten virus, say Karolina Böröcz. 
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and retirement homes, the hospitals should investigate the delivered patients and insulate MRSA-infizierte immediately. 
In the Hungarian hospitals, the microbiological test taking is not however so frequently practiced. 
Not least of all, because there is vonseiten of the state ill cash-register no allowances for this investigation. 
Most cases would come along only then to the light of day if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, so the medical manager of the Epidemiologiezentrums. 
Vonseiten there are strict recommendations for the European union, to the corresponding application of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there are however guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and Krankheitsbilder in Hungary as well. 
Antibiotic therapies should be purposeful that is, microbiological investigations are necessary in order that no resistance to the means can develop, this general instruction of hospitals is always complied with not as well. 
Under out-patient or in the basic supply the patients, microbiological test takings are even even more rarely, so Karolina Böröcz. 
Is saved in the case of the disinfectants 
Verify scientific proofs that MRSA is transferred from a patient on the other the most frequently by the maintenance personnel. 
Therefore the hand washing or the wear of gloves and masks is just of a great significance, however there are considerable deficiencies in the hospitals in this area as well. 
MRSA is transferred by droplet infection or contact, in the indigenous hospitals, it is not however always possible to insulate the infizierten patients. 
The rooms even often are overfilled, the beds connected barely although there should be a distance from at least 1,5 meter between them from epidemiologischer sight. 
As Karolina Böröcz continues to mark, it unfortunately even occurs financially for less well placed hospitals into that that one saves in the case of disinfectants, there are few male nurses, many patients - everything factors which favor the arising of infections absolutely. 
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there or the further distribution of the virus can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, so Karolina Böröcz. 
Government program against MRSA 
To get MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs for the health insurance, therefore they are fought everywhere. 
In England for example, the prevention of MRSA or their Eindämmung in the government program were recorded. 
After first signs, the program is successful - published data as occupy, are the tendency of the MRSA infections in England declining. 
The European center for medical prevention (ECDC) declared the prevention of the arising of multiresistenten viruses ((under this, even MRSA) as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
