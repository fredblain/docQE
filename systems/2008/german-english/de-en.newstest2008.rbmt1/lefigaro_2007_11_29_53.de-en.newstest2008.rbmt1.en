Spectacular repair to the space station 
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades of the occupation of the internationals of space station (ISS) will have used more than seven hours in the area in order to make the spectacular repair of a faulty sun collector which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific work at the station. 
A risked exit that on the basis of its duration, the distance from habitable modules, the speed's with which he was organized and the "tools" built by astronauts ", to make the repair, several Rekorde achieved." 
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded module Harmony of the space ferry Discovery, a large zylinderförmiges part which should receive the European and Japanese scientific Labore soon. 
This module is a type of landing bridge for the module Labore. 
However one must be able to provide them with current. 
It was therefore the second task of occupying, 17,5 tons heavy module for the current generation via sun collectors which was already on the ISS to turn over in order to bring it into its final position. 
After it had moved it, the occupation made to the restructuring of the sun collectors of the module whose chip width 76 meter is. 
And *, it happened that one of the collectors which leave as Akkordeone auffalten was damaged by a jammed cable on a length by approximately a meter 
The restructuring was stopped in order not still to damage the collector more. 
The astronauts who leave the space ferry Discovery originally for a control procedure and then another sun collectors whose rotation system was incorrect should repair, saw themselves compel to devote themselves to the damaged collector. 
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk at the end of the 30-meter-long ferngesteuerten arm of the space ferry which had been mounted on that of the station, round in order to make the repair. 
He is one of the best Spacewalker "(Wetraumgänger) of the NASA." 
Sent largely robustly, very much that he has a well developed upper body and long arms. 
The 46 jähirige skilled doctor was therefore selected, "operates on to " the "sun collector" injured . 
After he had examined the damage exactly, he divided the incorrect cable and fastened a type of rails on the damaged spot. 
He was "supported" by a second Spacewalker "which remained not far from the lock and, Peggy Whitson, Kommandantin of the occupation inside, of the other astronauts, among them." 
.
When the action was concluded, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely aufgefaltet before he counted his tools and returned into the station. 
The astronauts enjoyed yesterdays afternoon a half day relaxation before today seven astronauts returned onto the space ferry Discovery in order to walk up Wednesday the return flight probably to the earth.
