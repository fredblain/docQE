In the empire of Angela cloud 
The reality remote appearance the chancellor documents that the coalition is in the end in substance - and that nothing is to be more expected by her. 
In what country does Chancellor live this really? 
After their disconsolate appearance in the general debate of the German Federal Parliament which was wurschtig and contents poor one must say: not here - not in the country which would finally have to be ruled by her. 
Angela Merkel rejected with a badly overbearing sentence the accusation that it too very concentrates on the foreign policy. 
That is provincial, said it and thus showed first that it does not want to comprehend of what it is a matter for the critics. 
In the German Federal Parliament, it documented recognizable for all as their accusation is very true. 
Neither concrete interest was present nor to feel gar a feelings for the problems in the country. 
Instead, Angela cloud presented itself: a lifted up politician who flees into the foreign policy and remains there in the approximate one herself. 
Example climate protection: There it praises ungebremst for the decisions of holy dam but does not say as the climate objectives should be reached in this country. 
At all, the self-praise - so much Unbescheidenheit would still have failed the CDU Chefin for itself two years ago. 
Now it clings to the Floskel that the lift succeeds with the persons. 
Thus it damages its image as a Pragmatikerin which solves problems instead of the world nice encourages. 
.
Child poverty and the worries of the low wage-earners? 
It for that has a couple of additional sentences remaining. 
Is calling as it often misspeaks when it is a matter of the child surcharge. 
Merkel there needs three starts in order to bring out halfway a geraden sentence. 
It stumbles as on foreign terrain if it becomes concrete.
