In Havanna, high houses grew, over the wide boulevards of car go which were part of the cult symbols of the fifties of the past Jahrhundets.

And today? 
On the walls of the Bodeguita from Havanna, you too can leave behind your autograph. 
At the bar in the hotel Nacional, one completely as desired mixes for you of cocktail. 
And the cult cars of the fifties go around in Havanna until today because the Schigulis imported once and Fiats have already fallen apart in the salty and moist air for a long time. 
Havanna, particularly its oldest part descend, heavily, one finds as many wonderful colonial sights in the circumference nowhere here right. 
Other places become just herausgeputzt, for example Trinidad. 
There was green light in regard after that that the tourism earns immediately necessary money. 
In the last fifteen years, new hotels not only resulted in Havanna but also in Varadero, at the coast of the province Holguín and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.

Excursion destinations 
The majority of the visitors Cuba's does not omit the meaning most ending places. 
Thus one must no longer write about Varadero or Havanna in detail. 
It is to be only mentioned that a museum is situated in the estate that is already mentioned Hemingways, the visit of which should be able to be escaped this author that, this, not. 
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba. 
The luxurious vegetation increases to lime ground. 
The Mogotas, lime hill and rocks tower steeply of the valley ground, in their hollow areas, fruitful ground collected through which even rock areas that weathered are covered by dense algae growth.

Trinidad 
.
Fame and wealth brought her of the trades with slaves and sugar. 
The wealth personified in the trim beauty of the small city. 
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influences by the later French settlers, scarcely changed for four hundred years. 
Trinidad, lain between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is such a remote place that there was still no road there in the fifties of the last century which would have connected the area with the remaining country. 
This insulation contributed to its having remained unbeachtet. 
Nothing was constructed there but even nothing therefore torn off, each was glad that he had a roof over the head. 
If one has time for Trinidad more than one afternoon, then it is worthwhile to look at interesting places in the environment as for example the beach Playa Ancón or the "valley of the sugar factories". 
In the evening one should then go in the Casa de la Música which comes to life following the darkness where music does not cease until the morning. 
Baracoa 
Some describe this small town completely in the East of Cuba as the nicest of the island. 
Probably this view is influenced by the path as well there. 
Both roads which lead of Guantánamo there must overcome high and zerküftete mountains and run through a countryside which is scarcely touched by human interventions. 
The UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba in its world heir catalogue thanks to the untouched nature there. 
There the best chocolate is produced, in the church, one shows the cross of Kolumbus (it sprang up in reality hundred years approximately after one the journeys of Kolumbus) and from the hill, where the former castle, the present hotel El Castillo, is, several board mountains are to be seen of which El Yunque is the one well-known.

However, as one like that says: Look at better with its own eyes.
