A colleague informs about the acceptance of illegal Internetdownloads into the punishing law book: 
A. The Download of a song would be a law breakage which affected become with six months of custody. 
But if you rob wiederrum a music business under a value of 400 Euro, this is considered only a simple violation (articles 623.1). 
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 Euro, then the theft to be sure becomes as criminal act classified, nevertheless the punishment fells from more smaller than in the case of a Download (articles 234 punishing law book). 
C. If you steal a car and return it again forty hours later, then the punishment still is smaller than in the case of a Download (articles 244.1). 
D. One must participate less gravely in a brawl as at a music data exchange. 
To participate in a rebellious confrontation involves a prison punishment for months from three to 12 (article 154 punishing law book) while the data exchange results in a liberty withdrawal of six up to two years in months 
(Article 270 punishing law book). 
E. According to article 184.2 of the punishing law book, sexual bothering at the workplace is regarded as less worse than the downloading of a DVD film from the internet.

The study was prepared mithilfe by a tomographisch magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the last edition of the science magazine Science. 
Following statement Bernd of weaver, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life&Brain,  were the activation the strongest at the time when the participant provided correct answers and by contrast his fellow player scheiterte." 
The researchers were able to recognize that the brain activities always turned out to be very moderate if both participants with their answer lay correctly and, accordingly, received the same salary as well; however if one received the double one from them, a more powerful Gehirnaktivität." as well took place 
I am not quite certain for myself whether it in fact requires as much scientific expenditure to reach such a result.
