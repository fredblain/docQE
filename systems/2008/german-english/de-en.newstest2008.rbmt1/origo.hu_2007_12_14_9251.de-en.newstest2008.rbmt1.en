Units of the British army published for the purpose of popularity increase on the video portal receptions on operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan. 
First, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have loaded since March 2006 Videos on operations conducted against the Taliban into the network, reports the BBC. 
The miniature cameras fastened on to helmets turned receptions are checked at the Air Force restart point in Kandahar and sent to London then where they are placed into the internet. 
Political message unavoidable

The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 in order Videos over Iraqi and to publish afghanische operations but has the British Aussenministerium (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace troops (MNFI) stationed in Iraq as well its own YouTube channels. 
Insertion into Afghanistan

Such type's published propaganda is almost cost-free in comparison with conventional television advertisings, so defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, however these Videos always carry in themselves a certain degree of political message as they confirm the existence authorization of the military measures decided by the government in its own way. 
Americans advertize with play 
The army must however also fight against amateur receptions which worked on it carefully next to that, get zensurierten receptions into the network as well - as for example such which show the soldiers' death: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, it is spoken about the losses at most that the bloody sides of the war are not however shown. 
Of the war show places in Iraq and in Afghanistan, numerous Videos turned in use has incidentally already been loaded to the platform, the Britons however just a short while ago discovered this "kind" for themselves. 
The Americans advertize meanwhile on the somewhat other type, namely with the shooting play downloadable free-of-charge "America's Army" into which the player can slip in the context of a simulation more or less true to life into the soldier's skin.
