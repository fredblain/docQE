In the Budaörser trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" increased of this year as well about 16 percent, however price increases were registered on all hypermarkets of via 1.000 HOOF. 
After the prices are "davongaloppiert" on the food markets in the past December, price increase prozentuell did not turn out to be drastic, compared with the anyway high, earlier exit level. 
However, it has an effect on the consumers certainly as a deterrent that that is not for which they had still paid in the last year far under 9.000 HOOF of this year available once for 10.000 HOOF. 
The price of the "Napi" goods basket crossed the magische 10.000 hoof border about at least 91 HOOF on the investigated markets. 
The highest price amounted to 10.573 HOOF. 
(The price was next to 6.800 HOOF in 6800.) 
The prices for Unicum and lively fish almost remained on previous year level, heavily the prices for turkey breast nettings, nut and poppy by contrast increased. 
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the central statistical office of Hungary, in the case of Auchan, there was however 1kg bread rolls for 139 Forint. 
It gave up no competition limited price slump with the product under 200 Forint. 
The price was surprising a two liter of Coke Cola pledge bottle here of under 200 Forint, therefore the drink cost inclusive pledge only 257 HOOF. 
Nevertheless, Cora performed this year in the "Napi" Warenkorbs comparison Auchan the most expensively and the most suitably. 
Our calculations showed that Cora the prices in the "Napi" goods basket in comparison with the Christmas prices in the past year about 15 while Tesco and Auchan in each case increased about 18 percent. 
The difference between the most inexpensive goods basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the year of this year amounted to 12% while the raise comprised between most inexpensive goods basket of the past year and most expensive of the current year 21%. 
The average price rise amounted to 1.480,00 HOOF. 
The average price increase was still next to 1.206,00 Forint in the previous year, however the value-added tax raise made noticeable for itself with the prices for last Christmas. 
Exact this procedure met the trade badly: Apparently the department stores were not able to decide so rightly what price chips they should use in the individual articles since the effects of the price increase were unabsehbar on the consumption behavior. 
(If the vendor plans the circulation speed of a product badly, he can fall about essential profits in the price span which follows the traffic intensity.) 
The price increase of the "Napi" goods basket turned out to be Mehwertsteuer caused so radically in the past year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 about 1720 Forint whereas the price difference was with the most inexpensive basket mere of 844 Forint. 
Such extremes were not observed this year as the most expensive basket cost about 1.630,00 Forint more than in the previous year and even in the case of the cheapest one there was a price rise of 1.284,00 Forint. 
A catastrophic price increase was manifested in the comparison of the two last Christmas seasons, the price of the daily consumer items on the hypermarkets increased for months less in 20 more than 30 percent. 
(This again does not confirm the data of the central statistical office of Hungary unconditionally: The statistical office established one with some basic foods in the period of 12 months more than 30-prozentige price increase. 
So for example next to flour also in the case of eggs.) 
If one however throws a look into the "Napi" goods basket, this seems in the case of almost latter impossible since the price level of the product which cost already in the previous year at worst about scarcely more itself than 10 percent rose. 
Flour suppliers are obviously in a more powerful position, than the egg suppliers - in any case they were able to shift the drastic price increase onto the Multis. 
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is reported continuously by good years. 
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not at all look at the prices more. 
Large amounts are purchased from all, holdable foods go over the counters in pallets. 
Wednesday vormittag there were endless queues in the case of the spot as suddenly the number of the customers exploded. 
However, a smaller customer frequency is reported by the country so that many Multis are complained in the case of the opinion researchers that they could not reach even the planned turnover, that is not only in the case of foods but also in the case of nachhaltigen consumption materials.
