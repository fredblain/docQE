Budget is through 
Yes, it is managed. 
The state household is endorsed. 
What is what is special in this household? 
It is the first household that this government designed and that was accepted without aid the opposition by the coalition majority. 
This for the current year was endorsed still with support of the CSSD (social democrats) because secretary Sobotka (from this party) had presented him and the CSSD was not therefore able to permit itself rejecting him. 
In contrast with the lively debating before the co-ordination on the mistrust application against the government, nothing dramatic occurred this time. 
The appoint house endorsed noted this traditionally little, nevertheless most important law calmly. 
That is so to speak paradoxical. 
All ruling begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the household whether that pleases one or not. 
.
That is a more grateful subject for the media and therefore they devote more attention to him. 
.
The state households suffered at the past social democratic governments from than three weak points that the household for year 2008 can not at the same time remove: 
In which case the first one it is not only concerns the high share of outputs which are obliging of law's the pensions but also about social outputs on which the "silent" coalition decided of CSSD and KSCM (Communist) in the last year before the choices. 
The second one is the deficitary budget policy as a result of the first weak point. 
The third limitation exists in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the local authorities. 
The greatest risk is not however the state budget deficit. 
This household is public and eingermaßen under control. 
A true time bomb is however the budget deficit of the local authorities. 
Many mayors gave in order to open up except takingses from taxes, taxes and bank credits further sources for investments, often debt orders mostly from by which they caused their city halls in the excess. 
In the last years, they succeeded, with these debts by numerous sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks that they had received from the state in the train of the denationalization in paying off. 
Now this source has already dried up. 
As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we determine that: 
our economy for some years as the remainder of the world, a growth phase go through, whose the CSSD is praised without Unterlass. 
That represented a single possibility of their governments to take public finances into order. 
Instead, these governments however involved the state @QD even more. 
Other countries, apart from a couple of exceptions as Hungarians, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, economized a lot more rationally than our republic. 
That is a giant disgrace which is to be attributed predominantly to the earlier governments. 
We are among the countries which seen, in the global scale, are threatened at the least of poverty. 
Therefore no nassiven social programs are necessary which were unfortunately blown up right in the last years completely superfluously in giant size. 
Even if it was is successful clear, a part of the absurd populistischen outputs which were discharged this year before the choices to delete that if shifting the pension entry age and a pension reform does not take place soon, then practically every policy ends up in this country and, who is in power all the same, nothing will remain for him as a pure management. 
It is exaggerated only easily if one says that then who will divide the largest part of the control takingses mechanically into pensions and social outputs of reigning politicians civil servants. 
Therefore the this year's household can not be a revolution but rather can stop only the expulsion of normal outputs by duty outputs. 
The deficit intended for 2008 of 70 billion crowns would be quite superfluous if earlier governments had not outputted in the last ten years, which only went. 
If we do not want really to take place that pure administrative civil servants come from reigning politicians, then we must be patient and wish for this not all too greatest coalition government which he is is however as able to take conscious that the state can only output as much at taxes and charges, rest with the preparation of further reform laws. 
Only these make possible a gradual enforcement of a balanced state household.
