England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara 
Here two dilemmas, each from that almost just as difficult as the other one. 
Who should hit as a number 6 for England in Kandy on this week-end, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara? 
And, who should the decision not make less relevantly in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka? 
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral chairman are, upon call at least under this special title, here Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan to help to decide about the leader trainer and because the table of High Morries, the English business-running director fills gradually, with applications for national voter offices, if even for which one in part time. 
The one who does not even always get the sixth bat position will be unhappy but the life often is unjust and it is the sport doubtless. 
It is never simple to nail exactly, make possible reach which the point of its job branch all person, while someone else over the lowest rank hinauskommt, sometimes due to lack of luck instead of capability. 
Where judgements it are are not only necessary in the Kricket where the selection is difficult which is always in the end subjectively. 
Is it to be risen the correct time for Bopara? 
Is it fair to Shah if he does it? 
The same can be asked perhaps also in a further area whether for example John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good conclusions which know the business well should be promoted. 
Who can say what is the correct class for a Kricketspieler unless, him is provided with the possibility to swim or to go down. 
Obviously numbers have a great influence on decisions, but chances also have this. 
Within a team, a Kricketspieler must catch the eye of the captain at the correct time if he can take a Wicket and a bat must obtain regular chances on the order if he wants to make as a one-day Kricketspieler impression. 
To catch the eyes of the Auswähler is more complicated. 
There was many this better in the last season than, for example, were as a James Anderson who will apparently play in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares itself healthy and as the wind bowls in the networks. 
Anderson took away 32 prime Wickets per 33 Runs in order to earn a position in this revolution. 
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had its glitter points and hopes for even more. 
Whether Shah or Bopara play in the Asgiriya stage can be only a view question. 
The choice could decide both men's careers or it perhaps however makes little difference. 
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first Runs useful with five Wickets and 40, Paul Collingwood was however to be strengthened, then still fight for who created the breakthrough to a significant Testkricketspieler and this although he dotted hundred against one double Australias in Australia, still is perhaps underestimated. 
It is probable that Graveney, Vaughan will follow their conservative instincts and stomach feelings for Shahs greater experience youthful enthusiasm, after a further discussion in the course of today's network meeting in the Asgiriya stage via Boparas and of moorland. 
There are arguments for. 
.
However Shah made only ten Runs in its two Innings in the May toward west Indies in the test in Lord, its homeland arena as a player from Middlesex this plus its instantaneous rejection of the Auswählern as Vaughan healthfully was in order to cancel its position for the next play, appears to have taken the swing from its hitting, this still in Bombay obvious was. 
The all expert from Essex shovel wise life pleasure by contrast has. 
.
He suffered smaller injuries and supposedly a shock, but the first thing, which he did was to be taken out its Vodafone (natural also gesponsort) and called its team colleague Alastair Cook who had observed this from the distance and to say with enthusiasm: "You saw that". 
Bopara is a much better field player, he bowls here on the play fields, which appears to go with him his medium pace with some effect and hits with confidence and destiny. 
To choose the correct man is a thing another to choose the correct time. 
That is perhaps real art of the selection. 
I in addition incline to provide Bopara its chance now, which does not mean that Shah will not perhaps however stand there well if, as the tea sentence from Ceylon suggests he is that who will play this week-end here.
