The fathers the plant skirts return 
Germany's super group of the seventies makes music again: The three band members of Harmonia planned their consoles with a concert in Berlin again. 
To the Revival, a Mitschnitt from their large time "live 1974" appears. 
They were already fundamentally more famous then abroad. 
The scheduled sensation then happens in shape of three set gentlemen at the evening board. 
Each has his box before himself, its cables and above all its buttons. 
Dieter Moebius thront in the blossom white shirt in 63 years in the middle. 
To the left of 57 years flank young and in the possession of Laptop and guitar by Michael Rother. 
To the right, looks at from auditorium, Hans Joachim Roedelius, 73 bends, concentrated at the console. 
Each contributes noises, now and then even a Beat. 
And sometimes, it adds music to itself inadvertently to a conventional piece. 
That appears not then to disturb even the gentlemen himself.

Rother had helped out briefly in power station and then! as a Gitarrist in the case of new, the then perhaps most radical German group, a call erspielt. 
Rother however followed the cluster musicians in the exile about 1973 following forest in the Weserbergland. 
They lived there, in the altos Weserhof, a ruin from the 16. century, as a city fleeting Kommunarden. 
Less ideologically as in the municipality I where Roedelius was still allowed to be tormented as a nanny. 
Rather in spitzweghaftem artist present. 
Supposedly a pennant of the song organization Harmonia Ottenstein was also found in the bar garbage and for art a name.

For like that left and also summon sounded music that band suffered material need. 
The Selbstfindung did not serve the brushwood collection only. 
The CD "live 1974" appeared now was recorded with a concert in Griessem, 50-köpfigen record wings before one barely as someone believes to be remembered. 
The wish came from Rother then to force Harmonia and to practise it occasionally.

The band explained 1975 their separation. 
Rother landed in the Esoterisch spherical one and secured itself its existence with albums such as "blazing heart". 
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful since then than Harmonia was ever. 
The Griessemer live album is to be owed Herbert Grönemeyer.

The physical Wiederauferstehung of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world. 
Subsidizes publicly, in the context of festival Woldtronics. 
Julian Cope is there, the Briton, old punk and author of the reference manual "plant skirt samplers".

Plant skirt was always yes a very English concept. 
It never concerned skirt. 
The roots were searched for less in blues, as in music universities (Can), technologies (power station), fleeing or before artistic and social conventions (cluster). 
The one who "calls '68!"" here does not "have quite unjustly and Harmonia can not from that be brought even now from the rest." 
The most obvious one is still thought over thoroughly at the arena. 
Where does music begin and does when it stop?
