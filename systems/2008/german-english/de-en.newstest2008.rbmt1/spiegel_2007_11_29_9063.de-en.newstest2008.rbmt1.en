Venus is höllische twin of earth 
The Venus is more similar than to date thought in spite of its life hostile atmosphere of earth: The European space probe "Venus Express" discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind eddies on the poles how they appear in the winter on the earth as well. 
Scientists have supposed for almost three decades that it flashes on the Venus. 
Now the European probe "Venus Express" produced the proof - it tracked down electromagnetic waves on the brink of the atmosphere: The lightnings on the Venus shoot 56 for kilometers of cloud in a height of round to cloud, report Christopher Russel about the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature". 
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory," lightnings had the life resulted on the earth: Thunderstorms must have encouraged in the ocean reactions which led to the development of Aminosäuren, the modules of the life. 
Not so on the Venus: "If there were ever lives there, it must have been in the very early story", explains Sean Solomon by the Carnegie institution in Washington. 
Today it on the surface of the Venus scarcely might give something lively: The atmosphere is one around hundred times denser than on the earth, there reign temperatures of 500 degree now and then. 
"The Venus is perhaps the devil twin of earth, but it is a twin", Russel said. 
.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research as, since the beginning of the neunziger years, no more probe has specially been for investigating this planet on the way. 
The most recent research results which are now presented in several "Nature articles" not only emphasize the single good behavior of the Venus within the sun system according to the researchers. 
"They also show that the common grounds of our neighbor planet with the earth are first larger assumed", the Esa communicates. 
Thus the researchers found a cloud swirl as well next to the eddy wind well-known already at the North Pole at the South Pole which still turns fundamentally more quickly. 
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere, circumscribes a researcher team Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica. 
The second innermost planet of the sun system has almost the same mass such as the earth and is almost just as large with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers. 
The planet described as morning or evening star also revolves 225 for days around the sun in scarce. 
But he concerns a lot slowly himself: A Venustag lasts 243 earth days. 
Although the Venus reminds with surface temperatures of 460 degree of Celsiuses and a pressure of 92 bar scarcely on the earth, scientists assume that both planets developed under completely similar requirements. 
In both, water collected which remained on the earth in oceans, on whose Venus was however lost into the area. 
And while coal dioxide is fixed on the earth in carbonate rocks, it turns off the major part of the atmosphere on the Venus.
