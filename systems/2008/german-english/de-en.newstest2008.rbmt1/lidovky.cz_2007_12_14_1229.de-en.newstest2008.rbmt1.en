Global climate changes supposedly most damage developing countries. 
President VÃ¡clav Klaus commented on the problematic nature of the global warming again. 
.
He executed in Vienna where he presented his book "no green planet a more in blue," that the debates of ecologists unglaubhaft are. 
According to Klaus, the structure of conference inakzeptabel which forms a strange mixture of government representatives such and of non-government organizations but also the fundamental difference are not only between rhetoric that it accompanies and the reality. 
"The debate there is unstrukturiert, it is is word fireworks, only the substitute for a real solution of present problems," told Klaus. 
The Czech President emphasized when presenting its book that subject of this is very important for him and that he for that therefore like that engages him. 
He expressed his contentment as well about that that its book appears in German translation because "I often strike caricatures of my views." 
Now business prospects could therefore read its setting unverzerrt. 
Klaus reminded that he is not a Klimatologe but he has for its opinion after sufficient requirements in order to write such a book. 
He is finally graduate, able to understand professional discussions and to judge them, experience with statistics has and is people economist as well. 
He described the thesis as a main statement of the book that the climate changes constantly and that its changes are therefore normal that there is no concurring opinion to the earth warming among the scientists that the consequences of the present changes are not all too large and serious and, therefore, no threat represented that to influence the efforts, the development of the climate, inakzeptabel is superfluous, ineffective expensive and. 
Furthermore he holds it as someone which has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen to force other unbewiesene views for unacceptable, he regards that as a dangerous limitation of the liberty. 
He repeatedly explained on questions of present ones he is not against "a rational environmental protection, but against militante ecological activists who take no consideration on the relationship between expenditure and return." 
Klaus had already spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago in the Hayek institute.
