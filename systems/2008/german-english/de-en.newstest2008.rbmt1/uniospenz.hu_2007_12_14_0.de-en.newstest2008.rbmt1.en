Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages 
.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries deliberate on the schedule of Bali in which the emission reducing measures for the time to 2012, therefore are established at the end of the Kyoto protocol. 
Currently a violent debate is in operation between industrial and developing countries. 
The USA has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers, however they would be ready until to reduce 2020 by 25 40 percent the hothouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990. 
The other large question of the conference is whether the Industriestaaten are ready to support the developing countries both financially technologically in addition to the reduction of the emissions and. 
.
That the Kyoto protocol is assumed managed adaptation funds by a 16-köpfigen Council, probably in the case of the UN's global environment facility (GEF) as is to be read in the "Piac és profit". 
Hungary's six percent 
Minister for the environment Gábor Fodor supports in the name of Hungary the effort of the EU in keeping its outrider role with global climate protection measures and until to achieve 2009 a new international agreement. 
The secretary explained who the hothouse gas emissions will reduce EU by 20% until 2020 (measured against the values of 1990), independent of whether the "agreement" is achieved successfully "according to 2012" or. The union would is be even ready to support a 30-prozentige reduction soferne other large Industriestaaten of the world or developing countries ready too to fulfill its obligations responsibly to measure forces and. 
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the objective of the states, the 1997 had joined the Kyoto protocol, a reduction of only 5,2 percent was whereas the EU with then had already agreed its 15 member states to a minus of 8%. 
The guideline for Hungary is reduction of the hothouse gas emissions 1985 87 about 6% in comparison with the years - a guideline that the country will quite meet as one must read in the ministry's of the environment press communication. 
The use is high on Bali - in any case the long-term international climate political agreement must be finished within two years, otherwise it would become effective for certain only to 2012. In this instance no renewed, international emission reduction system would follow the reduction projects established in the Kyoto protocol, international scientific climate change committee of the UN distinguished with the Nobel Peace Prize emphasized the meaning of which the IPCC, the one as well in its most recent report. 
By this means the emission reduction would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the earth more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which would result in extremely grave and irreparable consequences according to Wissenschaftern.
