Banks want to cope with crisis 
The American Federal reserve, the European central bank and the Zentralbanken Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight together against the crisis on the finance markets. 
Thus will reach the currency markets more than 100 billion dollars by means of auctions. 
On these auctions, the banks auction interest sentences they himself are to be lent readily mutually money to which. 
For example, the American Fed 40 billion dollars send on auction further 24 makes them loose for the European and the Swiss central bank. 
There after the strokes of the 11.September, is the first time that the Zentralbanken of the individual states agree on such a coordinated procedure for the defense or Abmilderung of the consequences of a finance crisis. 
"This step should remove the greatest difficulties of the economy, therefore" wrote in a report for its customers Bernard Baumohl from the consultation company Economic Outlook Group "the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can loan". 
"The coordinated action of the Zentralbanken decreased from 65% to approximately 50% the probability of a recession in the USA," added Baumohl in its report. 
The banks lost billion dollars because of not served credits already at 60, above all in the United States. 
Analysts expect even further billion losses. 
The Zentralbanken must have been afraid really of this, which can still follow everything when were decided on this procedure, "the leader economist said of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies." 
"It appears that the situation is really bad," he said further. 
The Zentralbanken have become the fear that if the banks have seriously themselves access to loans credits even more expensive for their customers. 
That would decrease the consumption and the American economy rushes into a recession, possibly with effects on the economic growth in the entire world. 
The Zentralbanken decided themselves on this after they had not succeeded Interbankzinssatz which is used with the money distribution between banks to in lower the so-called LIBOR the Londoner. 
That means that the banks were afraid constantly to lend themselves mutually money that although the Zentralbanken of the USA, Canada and Great Britain had lowered their interest sentences during the fall repeatedly. 
"That will as have the same effect a further Absenkung of the interest sentences," consulting told the agency Reuters Greg Salvaggio of tense. 
Some Analysten are of the opinion that this step of the Zentralbanken toward warming up the crisis contributes because he does not solve the fundamental problem that is the case of the real estate market in the USA.
