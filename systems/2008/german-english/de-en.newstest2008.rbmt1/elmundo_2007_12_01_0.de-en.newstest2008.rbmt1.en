The Celtic Glasgow hopes for the point for the dividing into eighths finale in Milan 
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight on the next Tuesday in San Siro for the point that they lack in order still to reach their respective objectives before concluding the Championsleague preliminary match. The Italians need to arrive the point about at the point of their group, during these, decide on their participation with the bulkheads. 
.
The two plays of group D will take place a week before the end of the sixth play round as the FC Milan at the FIFA club world championship must begin in Japan where he will fight at the 13ten in the half finale for the first time for the entry into the finale which takes place at the 16ten. 
Thus this group will be concluded before all others and the Unentschieden in the Guiseppe Meazza stadium to the result expected on all sides even if both teams will attempt to win. The Italians become at home namely not the Keltik Glasgow does does not not want to speculate know which would become them group formerer in the case of a victory and in order that would have a better exit position in the dividing into eighths finale. 
A defeat suffices to qualify for the team of Gordon Strachan even when blowing the FC Shakhtar about itself. Nevertheless, he should not all too very trust in such circumstances, for the Ukrainern the participation is entitled to parity in the case of nine points; these had to be sure lost last week in Glasgow (2 1), but were able to win at the second play (2 0). 
Accordingly, the Milaneses will therefore attempt, the bulkheads the evening to vermiesen. The wiederrum hope to attain the dividing into eighths finale of the altered Championsleague for the second time in sequence after they were defeated at the vorrangehenden play season in exactly the same round by a gate by Kaka at the Nachspielzeit (1 0) and through a zero too zero Unentschieden on the Hinspiel. 
While the FC Shakhtar waits for the victory of the "Rossoneri", the team will have to concentrate on its own play as both the attainment of the dividing into eighths finale and its membership in the case of the UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow. 
The Benfica Lisbon could gain the third place in spite of its lower table position and without the view to be able to continue to participate in the greatest European championship by a victory and, therefore, play a part in the UEFA.
