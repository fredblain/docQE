Six as a deterrent trifles in order to anger work colleagues 
E mails that we forget to send, language reports that we never receive - harmless lies which do not at all strike ourselves more: They take "color" into the everyday life at the workplace. 
The question is mere whether one gets used to these small bother or positions himself one the challenge better and attempts this misleadingly, for other angry situations intentionally to vermweiden. 
Tips. 
"Sorry, I forgot to align for you that someone called of the marketing department" - a colleague says. 
That one by this means neglected a meeting? 
At best one regrets it and attempts to make up for it again by calling perhaps with the marketing department and admitting reumütig, one would have forgotten to align the report which is the less usual method). 
.
Before one entangles oneself in embarassing excuses, one should consider with which what one can give and attempt its colleagues really unpleasant moments to avoid these situations intentionally. 
Something lent what does not belong to one itself? 
It scarcely gives something sinewy as if one grasps according to a document, Bürozubehör or the telephone, it is not however there. 
Yesterday did the notebook device still lie on the desk - early this morning is it away? 
Or does does become reveal believed ballpoint pens to this lost for example on a colleague's desk? 
Without one should ask lend oneself nothing of the colleagues, for they are annoyed * if they determine that something got away. 
Therefore, no envelopes or mail its from the office into the pocket put, for it could meet one itself: none there more if however needs man's immediately. 
Getratsche over the colleagues' private life? 
There is no effective means, a gossip which has already been put in the world to stop. 
Who with whom, which made? 
Where and why? 
One should not tie for each to the nose if possible the information (or suppositions) on the colleagues' private life! 
And if someone is however opened and betrays us its innermost secret, we should not misuse this trust! 
The best one is as silent a grave instead of just not to align that present ones even if others know information as well about the problems of the colleague. 
Reported without reason ill? 
If one calls in the office in order to present himself ill with reference to tormenting headache because one feels just unwell or would only like to rest himself simply, one should realize one: The colleagues must now wear out its own work, unaufschiebbare treatments, projects with fixed deadlines instead of one itself. 
The colleague therefore not übel participates! 
If one already knows at the Vortag that one will not get it into the office on the next day or that something could interfere why one must stay home, one should report it on time in order that neither the colleagues nor the leader are confronted unexpectedly with the absence. 
Hum, tittering, phoning 
One is deepened just in its work but is disturbed suddenly by the loud tittering of the colleagues? 
Unintentional a telephone conversation overheard that one better should not have heard? 
One would not supposed to the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations( that one holds beyond their heads), tramplings, constant scolding or moaning nerven. 
That everything can be very disturbing even if they are not deepened right in a task (write, plan, organize). 
Is the other always guilty? 
.
If possible one should not make excuses on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues! 
The best one admits its errors for myself and excuses if others were affected by this as well! 
The question how one make up for the error again which can make up neglected is only all too appropriate! 
In the office - a feelings as home? 
Training pants and Schlapfen: Nothing however lost comfortably home in the office! 
Not once one should so dress oneself leger if the job allowed it really! 
Become not too slovenly only - one both its colleagues and * as far as should respect that one dresses in the office accordingly - if desirably nicely elegantly, and!
