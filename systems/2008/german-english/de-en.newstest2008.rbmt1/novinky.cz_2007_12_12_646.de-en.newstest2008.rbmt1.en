Test Peugeot 207 1.6 sw VTi: Voruteile fades 
In order to say the truth that I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206. 
Its driving characteristics were not a lot worth, the quality of the gearshift, one was able to describe as rather sub-average for the control as well as the processing. 
However now its successor, Peugeot 207 are, on the market and this is about much better. 
The station wagon with the designation sw is another piece further and only remains for me to revise my opinion. 
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, I had to complain myself for example over the head liberty that is too small on the rear seats. 
There are now no longer these complaints, for the car body of the station wagon is formed in such a way that even two meter men will not suffer. 
Quickly further 
I go through the internal equipment only briefly in order not too very much to repeat me. 
It concerns a rightly successful design where I have objections only because of the kümmerlichen medium tunnel. 
.
The seats are comfortable and past are the times where we possibly complained about too short seats or head rests. 
Even the side hold fundamentally improved in comparison with the 206. 
Regarding the space offer, one can feel the enlarged measurements of the car body here as well. 
In the station wagon, the lack that is already mentioned of head liberty is also remedied. 
Suitcases in the trunk 
The main point on this car is however the load room. 
I (even because of the unfoldable reverse window) must describe that as very well loadable and space-saving. 
.
They do not disturb, leave auseinanderziehen and establish even more difficult objects. 
However, we talk about the drawer volume. 
It amounts to according to table in basic equipment 428 liters, which is a rather average value in comparison with the competition. 
However not in comparison with vehicle of this class best-selling in the Tschechien, Skoda Fabia Combi. 
If we compare for the 207 sw with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we determine that the Peugeot stays behind by clearly marked 52 liters.

120 PS in four series 
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline motor with lift area 1,6 liter and a performance by 88 kW. 
And honestly, said, a 1600 Kubik motor should appear that a family Hatchback actuates. 
He is low, has a small consumption and pulls away well. 
If I compare him with its counter piece in the case of Skoda who sometimes affects than its exhaust with a rag would be stopped up, then I can only be inspired by him. 
The price list says volumes 
The price of this car is not just national. 
But we must remember that we tested a well equipped car with a spacious Innneren and a very good motor. 
The basic price of the car with the 1400er gasoline motor in height of 329900 crowns still concerns. 
With our motor it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot. 
Equipment Premium of the test car again hits with 80000 crowns in addition to beech. 
We however had Kopfairbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper release, electrical window lifter rear and and... 
Thus the car costs by and large simple 531900 crowns. 
That is a lot, however the additional equipment of a Fabia adds up you once and you will arrive with a very similar sum. 
Therefore only the decision remains what brand one wants to choose.
