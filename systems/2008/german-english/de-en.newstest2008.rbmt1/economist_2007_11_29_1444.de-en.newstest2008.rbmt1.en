Everything still openly 
Mitt Romey said that he does not keep it worthy of a presidential candidate to be asked by a snow man. 
In spite of this, the republican candidate declared himself the presidency in the end readily to stand for a debate on YouTube in which normal voters receive and hand in questions on Video in order to send the candidate them. 
None of the questions, this on the Wednesday evening, the 28. November, was raised, was as ridiculous as the snow man, questioned the democrats about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party. 
However the questions and the answers reflected this time the status of the republican party exactly which breaks up in the choices in the next year. 
It is not known just so the producers of CNN that the debate mitunterst√ºtzten which selected the beginning candidate of YouTube clip to be shown. 
.
The subject is one of the blow strongest subjects for republicans. 
The CNN asked to manipulate a group of unentschiedenen voters a choosing disk if they heard things that they liked: The television institution noticed spoke points of the agreement severely as the candidates via the borders. 
The sharpest and exchange longest of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national outrider and Romney which pushed in the decisive inquiries in Iowa and New Hampshire to the front. 
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call, he was flexible with respect to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York. 
He attacked Romney in that he the former governor of Massachusetts charged with having set illegal immigrants for working on its house. 
.
It was successful more insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, Californian congress representative and Tom Tancredo, a congress representative from Colorado, in the case of this subject nachzuhaken. 
Neither of the two men have serious chances with the nomination, but perhaps both remain in the racing, because they earlier and harder than others struck on the immigration bass drum. 
At least in the area of the immigration, the candidates divide the same views by and large: sharper borders, intolerance in comparison with illegal Migranten. 
Help to forget or to minimize this subject, together with fears via poisonous toy from China or other worries over the remainder of the world, for the republicans the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives. 
However the debate was became brought problematically as other subjects obviously for the language. 
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported weapon restrictions in the past. 
John McCain and Romney discussed this whether simulated drowning should be regarded as a torture. 
One of the question regulators asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible. 
This led to the result that Giuliani represented the point of view that although the Bible is its preferred book, he does not perhaps believe literally the story of Jonah and the whale. 
A further question regulator asked whether Jesus would support the capital punishment. 
.
When he was pushed for this whether Jesus would support it, he laughed about this and was said Jesus too intelligently for himself to apply a political office. 
The racing remains open extraordinarily. 
Huckabees rise in Iowa fells for most recent contribution successes and its approval storms together with Ron Paul in the debate of Wednesday. 
These two are high shot from the zero because the two wings of the party were to date not yet able to agree on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates. 
In year 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party with conviction with a victorious message over the size of America and a blinking from the beginning and to both wings of the party. 
The party is split this time and the result is not at all clear.
