Fixed days are not holidays everywhere 
In Hungary, holidays are exactly regulated legally so that the procedure for the reorganization of the work days meanwhile was established all around the holidays, however the coming year of less such days give presents us. 
In the EU as well and in America, one understands for something else by "holiday". 
The Hungarian right system differentiates between state holidays and work free days. 
Work free days are usually ecclesiastical holidays or are related to significant historical events. 
We celebrate New Year as well, for example: Both the last day is can rest the old work free days - latter alone already thus the ones the that celebrate and the first day of the new year New Years Eve. 
In the whole year, we have a total of fourteen holidays. 
The state holidays are 15. March which reminds of the revolution of 1848 and 23. October, the intending day of the revolution of 1956. 
On the 20. August, the state foundation is celebrated, on the 1. May the work, on the 1. and 2. November, we intend our dead ones. 
Furthermore there are two holidays to Easter, Pentecost and Christmas. 
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a week-end, the procedure for the "work day shift" proved itself in the cases in which we would work only a day before or after the holiday. 
The price of the lengthened week-ends is however that we must in front of that quite probably work on the Saturdays or must go to school. 
When this day which fells before or after the holiday should be processed last finally, it has been established by the work secretary in its own regulation for long years. 
The right regulation is likewise valid for all employers and employees, for public employees and civil servants of the public service. 
Only companies and installations in which the business is continued without interruption, therefore also on the holidays, are excluded. 
Pay is brought the work order something only by the holidays at the end of the year confused: The life stops from the 24. December positively in this country as most for the days take specially time adjustment or for that the this canceled vacation between Christmas and New Years Eves. 
In the next year, more holidays fall into the week middle or on the end of the week so that there will be less Umdisponierungen at the work days, than this year. 
The calendar is at first "put on the head" all around the day of the work in order that people can stay equal to four days at the piece home. 
Saturday, the 26. April become a work day in order that the Friday, 2. May can be a day of rest. 
The second Umdisponierung is connected with the holiday on the 23. October: On Saturday, the 18. October, one will have to process the Friday, 24. October first. 
The end of the year will however be remainderloosely in the sign of the holidays after from the 24. December everything lies and stops even if New Years Eve fells on a Wednesday.
