Political Capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk 
According to the department for risk analysis (Risk Analysing division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian guard founded in this August with support of the "movement for a better Hungary" lifted Hungary and the region's risk in several respect. 
It is been statement in the institute's "risk warning report" among other things: The highest political risk the "increase of the already existing ethnischen tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary which could lead even at short notice to violent ethnischen confrontations" represents in context with the Hungarian guard's activities. 
The strategy of the Hungarian guard who aims supposedly at the provocation of such a confrontation thus is main reason for that the research institute. 
As reported, this is seen persons responsible in this politically as a failure of sides: "People of the public life left representatives of radical political groupings the discussion of the Roma question which were now based their political strategy on the Roma Hungary contrast". 
One supposes that this intensify the problem, make the rational dialog impossible, extremities would favor as well as increase the probability of violent confrontations. 
The Forschungsinsitut not least of all "considerably" means "harmfully" thanks to the enormous attention of sides of the indigenous and foreign media, "Hungary's picture abroad" ausserdem which would have activities of the Hungarian guard", what the trust in the stability and democratic ripeness affects particularly". 
We remember: Since fall 2006, the re-organization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been continuous in the lift so that, since summer 2007, several have been founded organizations naming "national self-defense organization". 
"It is mean to these groupings that they in each case define as a civil organization while they boast openly about this, their members on - armed now and then - to prepare defense tasks (catastrophe protection, state defense, Ordnungshütung), with reference to the police's unsuitability the police's, the army or the state himself", it was called. 
And further: In accordance with that method which attempts, that everything occurs passed away political efforts based on the policy and party peevishness of the population as a middleclass initiative to tarnen. 
The emphasis of the civil character and the organization form therefore serve for the avoidance of legal hurdles which could emerge in the course of the entry at court only - there is not a political strategy at the same time. 
As one must find in the analysis, the activities present a risk-increasing factor to the Hungarian guard for the relations with the neighbor states as well. 
"In the last months, the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighbor states as a potenzielle danger source, the confirmation of its own antiHungary policy so sees some ultranationalistischer politicians of certain neighbor countries in the arising of the Hungarian guard." 
That everything has effects on the political stability of the region "- it was called." 
.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian guard with those of the Bulgarian national guard are comparable, the foundation of which was announced in August 2007 by the right extreme Bulgarian national union (BNU). 
In the background of the Bulgarian guard's arising, the Roma mass riotings which took place in a district from Sofia (Krasna Poljana) were. 
The BNU took the occurrences right to the cause for founding the national guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization the "national protection" is. 
In your opinion, the state was however remained noticeable inactive and indifferent for years a regular "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria namely in the past 17 - Political Capital so. 
And further: The initiative would have stepped away a violent debate in the Bulgarian public. 
As said that the increased risk for ethnische confrontations is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard to resistance tacks. 
Since the Hungarian guard's activities show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian national guard to date, it is not to be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react, with the organization of their own protection to the threats, it is been statement in the risk warning report of Political Capital. 
Attila Juhász, research director in the case of Political Capital said on inquiry of the report office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute. 
Risk analysis reports would be published annually and risk-changing tendencies should be recognizable, the public opinion is informed, as in the fall by handing over the Risikowarnberichtes.
