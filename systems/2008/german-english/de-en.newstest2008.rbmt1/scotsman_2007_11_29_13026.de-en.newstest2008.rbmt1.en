The climate on the Venus could reveal a view on the future of earth 
The Venus was perhaps a pleasant place once for the life, said scientists yesterday. 
.
The Venus is the n√§heste planetary neighbor of earth. 
The two worlds possess approximately the same size and have similar planet courses, however the Venus of the sun is somewhat nearer. 
Before billion of years would have reigned on the Venus conditions which would have been very similar to these on the earth and could have been even inhabitable, believe scientists today. 
However because of the ungebremsten coal dioxide hothouse effect, the erosion of atmosphere through solar radiation and a slower rotation pace, the Venus pursued a quite different development course. 
Today the planet of water is robbed and has a surface temperature which is enough heiss to melt lead and is devastated by Hurrikan strong winches and lightning storms. 
The realizations of space probe Venus Express of the European space travel agency which investigated the Planten for a year offer a sobering up look at as the earth could develop in the light of that of catastrophic climate changes. 
Professor Fred Taylor of the department physics at the university Oxford shirting, one of the director of the Venus Express mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate was is like that different on the Venus to that of earth while the planets are otherwise quite similar to themselves." 
"Our new data make it possible to construct a Szenario in which the Venus began before billion of years as the earth, possibly with one of habitable environment."
