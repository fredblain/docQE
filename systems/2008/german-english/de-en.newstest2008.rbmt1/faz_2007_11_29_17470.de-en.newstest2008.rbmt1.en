These are not Warhols crates 
The one who combines the concepts Sweden and wood crate thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol. 
Or however? 
Currently manufactured wood crates throw dark shadows at Warhols plant catalogue in Sweden. 
A major part of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there of the "type Stockholm" is forgeries. 
After the Swedish newspaper "ex-presses" stirred up doubts as to the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes of year 1968 some months ago, internal inquiries come in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now to a sobering up result: The six "Brillo Boxes" that the former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed the Moderna Museet 1995 as a donation are copies - and even the major part probably this for one around hundred other Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm" which are on the international art market in circulation. 
The history is interlocked, a confusing chain artistic and kuratorischer productions. 
1964 created Warhol its first "Brillo Boxes", painted wood crates which are based on the red blue white design of the paste boxes of soap powder "Brillo" in New York. 
.
It concerned not works of art but rather their models, bare exhibition pieces. 
At the same time Warhol 1968 probably the permission gave to have some produced few Brillo wood crates in Sweden which was not however displayed in the Moderna Museet. 
.
Some of them achieved on auctions more than 100 000 dollar. 
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén asserted later falsely that 1968 one around hundred wood crates in Sweden was produced and displayed which then left him Warhol. 
.
At this time Warhol has been dead for three years. 
Lars Byström, leader curator at the Moderna Museet, investigated along with the six museum own Brillo Boxes even three from Swedish private possession of which two 1968 were manufactured in Stockholm: Your pressing chipboards were primed and ground first, white oil color with a brush was served. 
.
"These crates were authorized by the artist and from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes one removes", the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, are reported: "If the 'Andy Warhol type Authentication Board' in New York does not come for another end, the Moderna Museet will classify the six crates as a copy material in its collection." 
Already in July admittedly the Authentication Board announced to follow the "difficult accusations" which are raised to matters of the soap powder crates. 
However since then, one has wrapped him there in unerbittliches silent.
