Wants to prepare - or as one becomes uninteresting for others 
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the all morning back-up. 
A strange melody from radio erklingt: The sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects. 
I turn volume high. 
The pace changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds and as a real sound jewel a female chorus. 
It is the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar, that on mr2 erklingt. 
The indigenous music scene did not just spoil us long time with qualitative Electropop. 
However now one sees even the back-up differently if one hears the new album of Zagar. 
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the indigenous digital Underground scene contributes to changing the entire picture slowly and even if the garage skirt with its Gitarrengequitsche is "in" again who proves indigenous Electropop: There is what is new under the sun. 
Balázs Zságer began in Pécs, made music even in the band Yonderboi before he - perhaps because a landlord house tolerates no two whistlers - follow begin its own path. 
He created the breakthrough with its project (Zagar) and its music which fuses elements from jazz, Electronic and pop but had approached him first as one with the request to compose the Soundtrack to a film (e.g. 
"Szezon" of Ferenc Török). 
The formation which had occurred originally in smaller clubs was known to the wider public first than magazine "wan2" aligned for indigenous albums under the Top 50 its first album from year 2002 and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to the almost single Trendsetter kürte marketable also in the west. 
Were Zagar and its bands "trendy" for doubt son, it however interested no whether they as well like to bear this brand. 
The band reacted as it: With a new but better album. 
The new album appeared now with title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new paths for them however the title already expresses the wish for continuity with the Pécser years. 
The print-out namely comes from the time, was still as a Balázs Zságer with another band on the way. 
The breezy, flying allusion would be yes in order as well, however corresponding - louder guitar, the influences of the Rock'nRoll strike the one - the time spirit and the trends in addition to the ethereal character of music. 
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti working live in England and with the band "The Puzzle" imagined with the premiere in the Millenáris. 
A song of the album managed it even to the radio hit - the mr2 Petofi transmitting since the whole day most recent pop music "this has for the listeners with number" Wings of Love", co-operating six indigenous singers ("Underground stars") one received, successive ones set the ear worm." 
Everything in order therefore (). 
The hvg.hu inquired of Balázs Zságer. 
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent does your music of a certain layer remain reserved? 
Balázs Zságer: The concept "layer music" does not mean precisely a lot to me. 
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, that is not Mainstream and Underground or Alternativ and pop but rather commercial and honest. 
Even so-called alternative or Underground music can be shallow and empty, just as they however also only for the sale can be produced which changes them into commercial music. 
.
The listener's receptiveness functions independently according to this principle, by languages and national boundaries as well. 
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign public in comparison with your music? 
B. Zs.: Pop music has a greater tradition abroad, particularly to the west of us. 
There not only teenagers or men in his twenties go to concert but also the older public. 
They pursue the trends in pop music which happens round about them much more attentively because they consider them a part of the contemporary culture as well. 
hvg.hu: What role becomes the public during work? 
Is it important, who, where, hear how much your music? 
B. Zs.: Naturally it is a good feelings to see that more and more come for our concerts. 
We however never composed for the market. 
In the case of us, music does not result in order to serve a purpose but rather for a certain reason. 
The role of the public is usually marked with the concerts where there is already a reciprocal reciprocity but which there is again only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment. 
Nevertheless, one struck me: If you want to make it of all right, you are no longer interesting. 
hvg.hu: How widely would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi? 
He is as a soloist on the way and set up his career more in the west. 
B. Zs.: We do not go its path really, times completely disregarded the fact that one attempts again and again, this into our music hineinzuinterpretieren. 
We see rather than Teamplayer, the one in the musical presence of the other one trust and they unfolded. 
Originally comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi unausweichlich were natural as several come to its band as far as we are concerned and took another route. 
hvg.hu: Wings of Love "in first place" is in the Charts of mr2 Petofi. 
Have heard many the name Zagar only this number. 
Was the opening with a somewhat more popular style inszeniert in the direction of a wider public conscious? 
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit which should then hold out as a train horse for the album. 
In this song, it is a matter of more. 
It was intended as a finale of the album with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult subjects. 
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers? 
Why was what just the guide principle? her what was the guide principle? 
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a Gospel well-behaved chorus. 
Then the idea came to combine the chorus from gifted soloists of the indigenous music scene. 
Thus sechsköpfige chorus resulted - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Eniko "Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh" therefore "-, we then baptized that apäter" Underground stars. 
hvg.hu: Did you just as want to have the song or do have it the girls mitgestaltet? 
B. Zs.: There has been the number for a long while in the instrumental version but however when the material was finished for the album, we imagined that this number still "needs something". 
The Akkordenabfolge positively asked for a song voice. 
I still sang in the melody in the same night, they learned the girls later. 
Everything came practically alarmingly spontaneously at once and. 
I can remember that I was considerable elektrisiert then, but it has already needed the "stars" as well. 
With my voice alone, the song would have never become so strong. 
hvg.hu: One had both on the record and with the concert however girls would be the impression, the one in the background. 
It gives no solo Part (refrained from the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, completely sing together and are not louder, than music, therefore their singing about music is not only accompanied. 
They were on the arena as well rear. 
Is it intention? 
B.Zs.: That they are stood at the rear was so because of purely technical problems. 
However, we wanted to send no solo roles to them intentionally. 
In the number, it is also a matter of this that one should forget its Ego a bit, forget who from where come and where on the way is, we allow simply that these certain wings, the wings of love emporheben us. 
I would like that others as well feel this euphoric status that we felt when the song resulted. 
hvg.hu: Which was the most expensive song? 
B. Zs.: During musical accomplish work real of none at all it, more more difficult tasks set rather with the mixture. 
For example with "Dorian Gray's dilemma" in which I play on a concert piano or in the case of "Rock'nRoll 'Goes To The Girls" where the Groove did not want to function longer, however gradually everything untied, as in the case of a Puzzle.' 
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number of the new album? 
B. Zs.: That changes continuously with the concerts and also where I have album "losgelasssen" now. 
Currently there are "prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and number "Never The sperm".
