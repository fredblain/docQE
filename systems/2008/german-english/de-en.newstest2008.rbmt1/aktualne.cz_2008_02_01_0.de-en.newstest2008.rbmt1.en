Because of less valency feelingses, deceptive broker risked billion 
Bottomless swindler 
Thus the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komercní banka calls its former employees Jerome Kerviel. 
It namely came on his account about almost five billion Euro. 
It however appears rather in such a way that Kerviel was only a large player who wanted to put it his colleague immediately, surely was not furthermore incapable. 
In contrast to all large bank houses, he recognized the crisis punctually by the amerikanischenn mortgage market. 
"He is psychically more weak," it was to be heard from the mouth of its superior who reported him to the police. 
As is however apparent from statements Kerviels which published the French media, for example daily paper Le moons, he was a person who had achieved at the end of last year with its businesses profits amounting to 1,6 billion Euro. 
Crisis not only in America 
"Everything what he wanted, money was to be earned for my bank," he asserts in his statement. 
In the summer, it had succeeded in profiting one half billion Euro right from the American crisis. 
He had namely already spotted the opportunity in addition at the year beginning. 
In February, there were quite first reports about that that so-called Sub Prime mortgages as they are given income weak customers or such which had payment problems already earlier, into difficulties would be fallen. 
Influence on the entire economy should have this crisis however not. 
Kerviel did not believe that and kept right. 
At the end of the year, he had his profit high screwed except for 1,6 billion Euro. 
"Had already as I this first half billion earned, I did not know as I should explain that," admit Kerviel and say further that he kept nothing definitive to himself. 
During the entire interrogation, he admits that he forged documents, in order that one would not come for him to the tricks. 
He even succeeded in leading his leaders behind the light even if the Eurex stock market was interested gradually in its businesses. 
Risk profit 
Did fear to fly up him? 
Probably scarcely. 
"I thought that it satisfies the simple fact that I earned for the bank 1,6 billion." 
From where did he take the courage to risk so a lot? 
He had to develop his position for himself gradually. 
He stepped into the Société Générale in year 2000, direct after he had concluded on, his studying at the University of Lyon. 
Its year salary amounted to approximately 51000 dollar. 
After two years, he was already assistant of a broker and he of independent brokers with a year content of 90000 dollar became in year 2005. 
Nevertheless, he knew that he will never earn as much as others. 
"I knew already with my first conversation in year 2005 that one observed me." 
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, "explained Kerviel the investigation civil servant." 
However the first large success came already soon after its entry. 
With the alliance's shares, he earned lot of by having depended one half billion Euro on course loss of this title with the London bomb strokes. 
And the release was that - now he wanted more. 
Solang it profit makes, we leave you 
"That is as a snow ball," he told the policemen. 
However the leaders supposedly knew about everything or suspected it. 
"As long as I earned money, schloss one the eyes." 
However however then the great blow came at the beginning of this year. 
On a single day, he all lost billion Euro. 
On a week-end in mid January, he wanted to balance that. 
When he came to work on Monday, he was employee of the bank no longer. 
And the bank announced a couple of days later that it lost five billion Euro on his account. 
And how did they come for him to the tricks? 
He made suspicious for himself through a vacation. 
"I took only four days of the previous year." 
A broker who takes no vacation is one which does not want that one sees for him in the tickets, "Kerviel finally said."
