Everything still open
Memo romey said that he considers it is not worthy of a presidential candidate, from a to be consulted.
In spite of this, the Republican candidate for the Presidency in the long run to a debate on to face in the ordinary voters ask video questions and submit it to the candidates to send.
None of the questions on Wednesday evening, the 28 November, were raised, as ridiculous as the snowman the Democrats about the global warming in the debate of the other party.
However, the questions and answers reflected this time exactly the condition of the Republican Party which bursts in the elections next year.
It is not known, exactly as the producers of CNN, the debate, the selected the candidates to selected the beginning.
However, in the first half hour of debate, the longest was dedicated to a single topic was immigration in the heart.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of manipulate voters to operate a if they heard things which they liked: the television noticed points of the agreement as the candidates strictly across the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between rudy Giuliani, the national outrider, and romney, the crucial inquiries in Hampshire and new pushed forward.
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call, it is flexible with regard to illegal immigration, when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked romney in it the former governor of Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for working on its House.
The two stopped especially hard as questioners asked whether one of the candidates, a "Amnesty" (illegal a regular status and the way in which citizenship would give) would support.
More insignificant candidates as Duncan hunter, a representative, and Tom tancredo, a representative from Colorado, in the case of this topic.
Neither of the two men has serious chances in the case of the nomination, but both of them remain in running, perhaps because they use and harder than other on which have hit.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates and the same opinions: sharper borders, intolerance illegal migrants.
This subject, together with fears about toxic toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world, to help the Republicans, the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives to forget or to minimize.
But the debate was obviously problematic as other topics for the language.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported in the past.
John McCain and romney discussed this, whether in regard should be regarded as torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates every word of the Bible.
This led to the point of view that Giuliani, that although the Bible preferential book, be it the history of jonah and perhaps literally did not believe the whale.
A further questioners asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
MIKE huckabee - now, contrary to all expectations in the first place, in a recent survey carried out in this one, owing to its Christian conservativism existing for a long time - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When he was pushed Jesus, whether they would approve it and it was said Jesus to intelligent in order to apply a political office.
Running remains extremely wide open.
Huckabees rise in falls together with Paul's recent and its in the debate by Wednesday.
These two are from anything, because the two wings of the party has still not on one of the better known and more traditional candidates were able to agree.
In the year 2000, a candidate in 1980 and the party from the outset and convincing reconciled with a victorious message about the size of America and a to both wing of the party.
The party is split this time, and the result is not at all clear.
