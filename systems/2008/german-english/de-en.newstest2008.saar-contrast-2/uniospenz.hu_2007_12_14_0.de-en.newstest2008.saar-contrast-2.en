Experts and politicians from 192 countries to discuss the schedule of Bali, in which the measures for the period after 2012, thus after the end of the Kyoto Protocol are fixed.
At present, an intense debate is under way between industry and developing countries.
The USA has already, that they do not want to negotiate about concrete figures, though, they would be ready to 2020 the greenhouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990, in order to reduce percent.
The big question is whether the Conference are ready, in addition to the reduction of emissions, the developing countries both financially and technologically.
It was also an agreement about the support achieved by developing countries.
The Fund is to put the Kyoto Protocol to be administered by a 16-koepfigen advice, presumably at the Global Environment Facility (gef) of the UN, as in the "piac profit" read.
Hungary six per cent

The employment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international agreement must be ready within two years, otherwise it would certainly only enter into force after 2012, which in this case would established in the Kyoto Protocol is not renewed, international consequences, whose importance also the IPCC, the international, with the Nobel Peace Prize distinguished Scientific Committee of the UN in its most recent report has stressed.
Through the emission reduction would be delayed, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 Â° C would be inevitable, which according to the extremely serious and irreparable consequences for would entail.
