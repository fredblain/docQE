For this, that it is a given a name, it was presented for a court in Khartoum today.
After indicating their lawyer, the British teacher in the Sudan, because an insult of Islam had been accused on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days of detention and following classification.
The Briton was accused of six to seven year allow students to have a bear the name Mahomet to give, although any representation of the prophet is prohibited.
They have earned it.
After parents of pupils several times with the Sudanese had complained to the Ministry of education, education and cultural, of the high school of unity was active, on Sunday to be taken up at home and according to Article 125 of the Sudanese penal code to the insult of Islam.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher their pupils six to seven year to choose a name for the choice.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports Robert boules.
Finally, when the select class votes to 20 of 23 children Mohammed as like first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Prophet, but above all, as well as a first name very frequent in Sudan.
Then the children a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on this and the "my name Mohammed.
The bear did not carry a label with this name, but the problem is, quite simply, that the representation of the prophet of Islam is regarded as an insult.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons at the same school teaches in Sudan, said that he knows it well, and they would never have done something with which they could get a religious faith too near, I only regret that it has asked the children, for a name to vote his opinion is only an innocent error.
An opinion, numerous pupils of the teacher share these as very attentive to their pupils and as a person who never talks about religion in the class describes.
It considers that the first name of Mohammed simultaneously in Great Britain on even the most frequent given, for which in English 14 different exists.
This first name often selected by Muslim families is regarded as a kind of respect in the prophet (it is frequently the given a family).
But what are the rules in the reference to the use of this?
One may give a toy him for example?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
