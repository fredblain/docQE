What insurance is suitable for me the best?
The insurance, a possible claim caused by the driver covers, contains a high cost, whose level of various factors depends, among other things, of age, sex, the time of the creation of the driving licence, kind of the insured, cars and its use, etc.
To have a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the fitting motor vehicle insurance as the right vehicle model.
First, it must be clear to one with which we have to do it here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is in writing by means of a versicherungsvertrags held, which specifies that the society receives and in exchange is engaged in a claim the corresponding compensation.
The premium is the price of an insurance consists through several factors, and other age, sex, the time of the creation of the driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance companies determine their prices according to the statistics, so that, in the event of a higher danger of accident, even higher payments due.
For this reason both via women make less payments, because statistics prove that these groups, thanks to their caution show a lower accident rate.
The same also applies to married people, since these after statement of the statistical values and therefore also for being one of the enterprise, fewer accidents tend as singles.
The use of the vehicle is attributed to influences the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more frequently the use, the more probable the damage.
With the installation of the insurance premium must consider a whole series of points.
For this reason the driver must also study the situation thoroughly exactly the car insurance to select the most likely approaches his personal needs.
We do this now, the most important points, the one with the selection of an insurance should take into account, in order not only an achievement - but also a oriented choice to be able to meet.
The less than 25-year-old meetings with the choice of a reasonably priced insurance numerous obstacles, such as the small and the "young" driving licence.
Even if it is for an ideal insurance cover best would be a sign, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives.
The careful drivers can select a full hull with, so that the services of a were covered, but at a low price offered.
This type of contract contains that the customer a portion of the amount resulted from the damage must pay.
The amount is before the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the premium; this is more highly the smaller the sum to explain Luis Noguera, main agent of Spain with Europe, an arrangement for on-line.
Another option is the extended insurance, the customer against external damages, however, against the damages developed at the own car.
In addition to this kind of insurance theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here is a piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hand to lower the cost of insurance; so your credit increases by trying to travel and to avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the case of the appropriate insurance company.
In the opposite to contain a payment an increase of said rate.
The amount of credits and punishing payments depend on the society and their returns.
If the enterprise a rich year behind it, can allow itself to increase, explains.
As soon as the exceeded it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing the accident rate sinks.
Therefore, it is the most sensible for a full with deduction to decide.
Usually the young people can not profit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident as at the time of the driving not to describe the practice of the European enterprise, and adds that the majority of the accidents in the second occur after the fear of beginner.
Nevertheless, it is in the case of a married customers, who does not possess children a sign; of course, only then, if it is the financial situation of the appropriate person also allows.
On the part of married couples with children as the customers with the lowest accident rate, and correspondingly low also their payments.
In this case, would be a fully with deduction (at an amount around 300 Euros.), the best option in the case that one received a high credit, recommends an extended insurance, the first for the third year.
You go in total relaxed and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to a larger contribution payment determine Luis Noguera.
It is good for pensioners, with a full deduction (at an amount around 150 euro), or an extended insurance which does only at a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, one must observe that the car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible, but also because it high costs, which require it, that a thorough choice is made, which corresponds to our personal situation.
