In many places you
This year, more than a thousand infections in hospitals that due to inappropriate handling antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff - all factors, the checking the infections is not good at all, as the leading doctor of the national.
In many cases, even in the case of the you.
In the traumatologie of to hospital, a mrsa-infection was diagnosed recently.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient, after a serious accident to the hospital.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here.
The injured a serious car accident was released from the hospital, a little later, the man had to return, however, with a mrsa-infection an important operation could since then, because of the, which is still in the body of the patient is not yet to be carried out.
Until 10 December of this year from hospitals activated by virus infections initiated at the national nosocomialis surveillance system, as the leading doctor of the national,.
So many activated by virus released infections were registered certainly in the hospitals, the true figure may be higher.
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were by the against methicillin-oxacillin of resistant triggered.
The staphylococcus (SA) bacterium contributes approximately one third of the people in their nose, without that it would cause an illness.
SA limited infections (such as inflammation of tonsillitis, inflammations of skin or wounds) usually react to antibiotics well, they are well curable.
The means are however measured out too high or used arises from the good respondierenden antibiotics resistant bacteria under appropriate conditions in the hospitals quickly develop.
In the case of patients with or permanently bad immune system, but also in age or patients with a low weight can these bacteria serious infections, such as infection or, therefore, cause.
The head of the medical according to hospital is nothing special, such incidents life.
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte a - there are not only there, where it is not searched.

With their admission to the hospital, the patients are examined, nevertheless an infection can always be avoided.
Sampling too rarely
The majority of the initiated by infections in hospitals, would be avoidable, though the currently prevailing conditions and conditions for the checking of containment of origin or the spread of the virus, says.
After this infection mainly in hospitals and homes for the elderly, the taken patients should investigate and mrsa-infected isolate immediately.
In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not, however, so frequently practised.
Last but not least because it on the part of the national health any subsidies for this investigation.
The most cases would come to light before then, if the patient is already a noticeable, according to the medical his of.
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations to the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there are, however, also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be called microbiological studies are necessary, so that any resistance to the funds can form, however, this directive of hospitals, does not always adhered to.
Under the or in the basic supply patients microbiological sampling are even more rarely, so.
You will at the
Scientific evidence to prove that of a patient, on the other, on the most frequent transfer of nursing staff.
So the hand washing or carrying gloves and masks a great importance, however, there is also considerable shortcomings in this area in the hospitals.
To is transmitted through droplet or contact in the local hospitals, however, it is not always possible to isolate the patients.

As karolina keep saying, it happens unfortunately in financially less well placed hospitals, even before that, in the case of you, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors which almost favour the emergence of infections.
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there or the further spread of the virus can be stopped, where these protective measures are adhered to, so.
The government program against to
In the grasp to get causes enormous costs for the health insurance, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of to, or their containment was held in the government program.
After the first signs of the program is successful, as published data prove the tendency of the declining in England.
The European Center for disease prevention (ECDC), the prevention of the emergence of viruses (including), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities.
