In the budaörser the price of the usual Christmas "napi" also this year around 16% were increased, but in all price increases of over per registered.
After the prices in the food markets in the last December ",", the price increase not out to be drastically, compared with the already high, former level.
However, it has an effect on the consumers, certainly as a deterrent, that, in the last year for which they still far less had paid hoof, this year, not even for 10,000 is available.
The price of the "napi" shopping basket crossed the by at least 91 hoof examined in the markets.
The highest price amounted hoof.
(was the price at 6.800.)
The prices for unicum and live fish, almost on increased strongly, however the prices for nut and poppy.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, when there was, however, for 139 forint.
It was with the product limited price slump with no less than 200 forint.
Surprising was here two Coca-Cola, the price of a bottle of less than 200 forint, thus including the drink cost pledge only 257.
Nevertheless this year in the "napi" at the most expensive, and at best.
Our calculations indicate that the prices in the "napi" shopping basket with the Christmas in the last year, around 15, while Tesco and cut each around 18 per cent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between shopping basket of last year and the current year constituted 21%.
The average rise in prices was 1.480,00.
The average increase in prices in the previous case was still 1,206.00, however, the tax increase with the prices at last Christmas apparent.
Exactly this process has met the trade badly: apparently the department stores could not so right to decide what price margin they should use in the individual articles, since the effects of the increase in prices to the consumer were unforeseeable.
(if the vendor the peripheral speed of a product badly plans, it can by substantial profits fall in the price margin, after the choices).
The price increase of the "napi" goods in the past year so radically, that the most expensive basket the value of 2006 by 1720 exceeded, whereas the price difference at the cheapest basket only 844 forint fraud.
Such extremes were not observed this year, since the most expensive basket cost around 1,630.00 forint more than in the previous year, and even with the cheapest, there was a rise in prices of forint.
In comparison with the two last Christmas showed a catastrophic price increase the price of the daily consumer items on the in less than 20 months by more than 30%.
(this is not necessarily again confirms the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, with some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months, a more than a price increase.
So in addition to flour as well, for example in the case of eggs.)
If one takes a look, however, in the "napi" shopping basket, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price of the product is already in the previous year, even in the worst case by little more than 10 per cent.
Obviously are in a stronger position than the egg - after all, they could the drastic price increase pass on to the multinationals.
In the golden deplore the hypermarkets not; it is constantly about good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not look at the prices more.
From all large quantities bought, lasting food go in over the counters.
Wednesday morning there was in all three department stores endless with the cash as suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country is a smaller frequency reports, so that many multinationals with complain, they could not even reach the planned turnover, and not only in the case of food, but also with lasting materials.
