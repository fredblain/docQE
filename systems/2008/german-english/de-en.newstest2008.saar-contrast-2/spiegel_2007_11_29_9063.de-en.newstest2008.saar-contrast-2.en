Venus is the twin of earth
The Venus, despite their anti-life atmosphere of the earth, as so far more similar thought: the European space probe "Venus express" has theory into the atmosphere and Poland's, as they arise in the winter also on earth.
For nearly three decades assume scientists, that it is on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus express" produced the proof - they sought out electromagnetic waves on the fringe of the atmosphere: the theory on the Venus shoot at a level of around 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud Christopher reported by the University of California in Los Angeles in science magazine "nature".
According to the famous "ursuppen-theorie" theory that life on earth develop: thunderstorms should have stimulated in the ocean reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the elements of life.
Not so on Venus: "if it ever life over there, it must have been in the very early history", explain Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington.
Today, it is on the surface of the Venus little live: the atmosphere is approximately one hundred times more closely than on earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus, is perhaps the of the earth, but it is a twin", said russel.
Why the Venus, the earth in mass and size is so similar to an entirely different development, is the basic question.
The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research, because, since the beginning of the nineties not probe more specifically to the study of this planet was on the way.
The latest research results now in several "nature" are introduced, emphasize according to the researchers, not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"they also show that the parallel our with the earth are greater than at first assumed, communicate the ESA.
So the researchers found in addition to the already well-known whirlwind at the North Pole, also a at still much faster.
This phenomenon reminds air on the earthly writes a group piccioni of the Italian Istituto by Giuseppe Di astrofisica spaziale e hemisphere.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers almost exactly the same size.
Also as tomorrow or described planet circles in just 225 days around the sun.
It concerns, but much more slowly themselves: a takes 243 earth.
Although the Venus with of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly the earth, scientists assume that both planet under very similar conditions developed.
On both water which remained on the earth in oceans, on Venus, but in the area was lost.
And while carbon dioxide on earth in carbonate rocks, makes it on Venus, the majority of the atmosphere.
