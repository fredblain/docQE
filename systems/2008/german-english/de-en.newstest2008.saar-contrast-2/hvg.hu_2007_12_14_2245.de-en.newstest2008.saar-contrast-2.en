Six as a deterrent, in order to annoy
E-mails which we forget, we never received - harmless lies, which we do not notice: they bring "," at work to the weekday.
The only question is whether one of these small used, or is it better to the challenge and tries to this misleading, aggravating for other situations.
Tips.
"sorry that I have forgotten to pass on to you that someone from the referred - a colleague says".
That it has missed a meeting?
At best, one regrets it and attempts to make it again to when one perhaps with the calls and admitting, one would have forgotten to align the report that is the usual way).
The thing is usually dismissed with an excuse.
Before one oneself in excuses, one should consider, with one of his colleagues can truly prepare unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations.
Something lent, which does not belong to one?
There is hardly a little pithier as if one according to a document or the telephone, but it is not there.
Yesterday was still on the desk - it is today?
Or will the believed lost ballpoint pens about on a colleague's desk?
No one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow, because they are annoyed if they find that something disappeared.
Therefore, no covers or mail from the office in the bag because they could meet: no more, since, if one 's but urgently needs.
Gossip about the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means, one of which has already been put in the world, to stop.
Who, with whom, which made?
Where, and why?
One should the information (or assumptions) on the private life of the colleagues if possible not to tie the nose!
And if someone opens and its internal secret tells us, we should not abuse this confidence!
The best one keeps quiet as a grave, instead of just is not present to adjust, even if other about the problems of the colleagues also know.
Without reason ill announced?
If one is in office in order to present itself ill with reference to tormenting headache report because one just feels uneasy, or simply would only like to rest, one should take a clear: the work of their own, urgent, projects with fixed dates must now the colleagues instead of a themselves.
Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore!
If one already knows at that one it at the next day do not get into office, or that something could interfere why one must remain at home, one should announce it in time, so that neither the colleagues, nor the boss unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Hum, tittering, telephoning
One is right in his work deepened, but you do giggle disturbed by the colleagues?
Unintentional a telephone conversation that one should not have heard better?
One should not the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (one over their heads,) moaning or permanent nerves.
All this can be very disturbing, even if it is not just in a task (write plan, organize) deepened.
Are the other always to blame?
A project is not ready in due time, one has a letter or important nachrichte, one should not forget to send the fault of its own forgetfulness not with other search!
As far as possible, one should not on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best one admits his errors and excuses if others were affected by this as well!
The question of how one mistake again, or which missed retrieve can only too missed!
In the office - a feeling like to home?
Pants and schlapfen: force for at home, but in the office lost nothing!
Not even then one should so casually dress, if it would actually permit the job!
Only not to become too - one should both his colleagues, and also itself as far as respect, that one dresses accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
