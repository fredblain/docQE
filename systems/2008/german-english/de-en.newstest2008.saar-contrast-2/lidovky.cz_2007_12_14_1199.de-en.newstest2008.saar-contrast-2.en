Budget is through
Yes, it is done.
The budget is approved.
What is special one at this budget?
It is the first budget which this government has designed and without support the opposition was accepted by the.
For the current year still with the support of the ssd (social democrats) approved because it Minister (of this party) had submitted, and it therefore could not allow to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no against the government nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Parliament approved this traditionally considered, nevertheless, some highly meaningful law calmly.
This is to a certain extent paradoxical.
This rule begins and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the budget, whether one likes or not.
The budget is an essential component of the policy, however, is covered by the power of the government and the opposition.
This is a subject for the media, and therefore they devote more attention to it.
A fight among politicians is much more interesting for the public as a bare figures.
The national budgets suffered at the last social democratic governments under three weak points, the budget for the year 2008, not at the same time can eliminate:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure, because of law obliging, whereby it is not only about the pensions, but also about social, the "implicit" coalition of ssd and ksm (Communist) in the last year before the choices.
The second is the account budget policy as a result of the first.
The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the deficits of the local authorities.
The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and eingermassen under control.
However, a true time bomb is the deficit of the local authorities.
Many mayors distributed by except gains from taxes, and bank loans further sources for investments, often mostly bonds, through which they their in excess responsible.
In the last few years they managed to these debts by massive sales of stocks of energy and other supply networks, in which they had received from the State to pay off.
Now this source already dried up.
As far as we only at official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy for some years, like the rest of the world, a growth through which the incessantly himself boasts.
This represented a unique opportunity for their governments, public finances in order.
Instead, these governments were to the state, however, still more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Pakistan, Albania or Egypt have much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a giant disgrace, which mainly be ascribed to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, seen in the global scale, at least are threatened by poverty.
Therefore, no nassiven social which, unfortunately, just in the last few years very in gigantic extent was blown up.
Even if it is successful, a part of the absurd populist expenditure, which were adopted this year before the elections, to delete if it is clear that in next time not to a shift of the pension entry age and to a pension, then virtually any policy in this country, and, all the same, who is in power, he will not have anything as pure administration.
It is only slightly exaggerated, if one says that then from the dominant politicians, civil servants are the largest part of the tax revenue mechanically on pensions and social divide.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but it can only the expulsion of normal expenditure by duty areas.
The planned for 2008 deficit of 70 billion Crowns would be quite superfluous if former governments not spent in the last ten years, which would have only worked.
If we do not want that it really comes to that from the dominant politicians pure verwaltungsbeamte, then we must be patient and that is not too strong coalition government, however, which is conscious of the fact that the State, just as much as it can take to taxes and charges in the situation is, rest with the preparation of further wish.
Only these make a gradual enforcement of a balanced budgets.
