Spectacular repair at the station
Astronaut Scott and his comrades of the crew of the international space station () more than seven hours in the area have used the spectacular repair a defective carry out for the continuation of the scientific work at the station is indispensable.
A risky exit, on the basis of its duration, the distance from habitable, the speed with which he was organized, and of the "tools, in order to carry out the repair, several record achieved.
The problem arose on Wednesday, when the astronauts the module of the ferry discovery had, a large part of the cylindric soon the European and Japanese scientific should receive.
This is a kind of Pier module for the laboratories.
However, one must be able to provide them with current.
The second task of the occupation, it was therefore a tons heavy module for electricity generation on solar panels, which was already on the convert to bring it into its final position.
After they had moved it made the occupation of the restructuring of the solar panels of whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened, that one of the collectors, as akkordeone make through a cable on a number of approximately a meter was damaged
The restructuring was stopped, in order not to damage the collector still more.
The astronauts who originally for a ferry and then another, the rotation system was incorrect should repair felt compelled to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott was selected at the end of the long arm of the 30 meters remote-controlled ferry at the station had been made round in order to carry out the repair.
It is one of the best????, this (wetraumgaenger) NASA.
Large, resistant, very much that he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
Therefore, skilled doctor was selected the collector trained to operate.
After he had examined the damage exactly it cut the cables and incorrect attached a kind of rails on the damaged place.
It was of a second????, this near the inside, supported by commander, and of the other astronauts Peggy among them, the crew.
This tool, which he used a, stick around on the solar panels, which several hundred volts produce an electric blow to prevent, had the astronauts on board the station devised and tinkered ".
When the action was concluded Scott, waited until the was completely folded, before its tools and returned into the station.
Yesterday afternoon, enjoyed the astronauts diversion half a day before today seven "on the shuttle back to Wednesday the most likely to enter upon the earth.
