Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are regulated legally exactly, so that the practice of working days around the holidays, established in the meantime, however, give us the coming year some such days.
Also in the European Union and in America, one means something different under "holiday".
The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and days.
Days are mostly church holidays or stand with important historical events in context.
We celebrate new year as well, for example: both the last day of the old, when the first day of the new year, are days - already so that the latter alone can rest.
In the whole year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
These are the 15 March at the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, the establishment of state, on 1 May the work celebrated on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead.
Furthermore there are two holidays at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our Heads of State or religious holidays rarely on a weekend fall, the practice of the "," proved itself in the cases in which we before or after the holiday, only one day would work.
The price of the prolonged weekends, though, that we on Saturdays in front of work very well, or must go to school.
When this day before or after the holiday, you should at long last be processed, since long years by the Employment Minister in its own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and recipients, for public employees and officials of the public service.
Only companies and facilities are excluded, in which the company without interruption, therefore, also at the holidays, continued.
This year the rules only through the holidays, at the end of the year, is somewhat mixed up: from the 24th December remains in this country really do, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the specifically for adjustment taking holidays.
In the next year fall more within the holidays or at the end of the week, so that, at the working days will be less than this year.
The calendar is around the day of the work on the head, so that the people by four days now at home can remain.
Saturday, the 26 April a working day, so that the Friday, 2 May can be a day of rest.
The second change is connected with the holiday on 23 October, on Saturday, the 18 October will be one of the Friday, 24 first of all have to process.
The end of the year will however be dominated by the holidays, after all, from the 24th December and do it even if New Year's Eve on a Wednesday.
