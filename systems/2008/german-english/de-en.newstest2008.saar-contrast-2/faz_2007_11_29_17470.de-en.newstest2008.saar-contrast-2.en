These are not warhols boxes
Who the concepts of Sweden and wood thinks Ikea but not Andy in.
Or anyway?
At present, raise in Sweden dark shadow on warhols.
A large part of the listed there by the "Stockholm" are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper expresses some months ago about the authenticity of Andy warhols of the yearly 1968 stirred up internal investigations come in, in Stockholm now to a result: the six "boxes", the former of which the Museum in 1995 as has bequeathed are copies - and probably the majority of another about one hundred of the "Stockholm, on the international art market in circulation.
The history is interlocked, a confusing artistic and kuratorischer productions.
In 1964 created in New York, its first "boxes" painted boxes, which on the design of the cardboard boxes of "brillo".
An exhibition of his work in 1968, stated - with warhols agreement - hundreds of brillo cardboard: this originated (for reasons of cost) is not of, but were delivered directly from the brillo-kartonagenfabrik.
It was not a question of works of art, but the examples in order to bare exhibits.
At the same time, in 1968 probably the permission of a few brillo wooden produced in Sweden to make, though not in, were issued.
Contemporary witnesses are talking now about fifteen boxes, which then as authorized original-andy-warhol-brillo-boxes with the name "Stockholm" to right in the auction and history.
Some of them have on auctions, more than 100 000 dollar.
The problem is now that of the legendary of museum later falsely claimed, it 1968 approximately one hundred in Sweden was produced and issued him then left.
In fact, 105 boxes before 1990 in Malm√∂ for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time, was already dead for three years.
Lars bystroem, on the curator, along with the six even three from the Swedish private property, of which two 1968 were made in Stockholm: their chipboards were first and ground after that with a White was applied.
The structure of the copies from the year 1990, on the other hand it betrays that the with a without coat directly on the applied was, moreover, it is not a question of oil, but about color.
"these boxes were not by the artists autorisiert and from the official list of Andy warhols" can be removed, the director of the, Lars announce: "if the 'Andy in kind board' in New York did not come to a different conclusion is that the in the six boxes in its collection as copies / classify."
Already in July certainly the board announced, the "serious accusations" to follow in the area of the soap powder boxes are raised.
However, since there in one remains silent.
