The climate on Venus, a view of the future of the earth reveal
Perhaps Venus was once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data on an orbit supply European show that the planet Earth still a twin resembles more aware than up to now.
The Venus is the sewing Estonian planetary the earth.
The two worlds have approximately the same size and have similar planet courses, however, the Venus the sun is somewhat closer.
Before billion of years had there been conditions on Venus, very similar to those on earth would have been and could have been even inhabitable scientists believe today.
However, because of the carbon dioxide, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower suggested Venus, a quite different one.
Today the planet of water robbed and has a surface temperature, which is enough, lead to melt and by and flash storms devastated.
The findings of the space probe Venus express the European Space Agency travel for a year examined, offer a view of how the earth, in view of the disastrous climate changes could develop.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department of physics the Oxford University, one of the director of the Venus express mission, said: "It is clear why the climate on Venus so different to that of the earth, while the planet rather similar otherwise."
"our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which the Venus before billion of years as the earth has started, possibly with an environment."
