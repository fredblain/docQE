Test Peugeot 207 sw 1 (6) vti voruteile disappear.
To tell the truth, I was never a particular fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving properties were not much, the quality of, the control and also the processing could be described as more below average.
But it is now its successor, the Peugeot 207, on the market, and the situation is much better.
The kombi with the name of sw has moved on a bit, and it only remains for me to change my mind.
The traditional hatchback of 207 tested, I had to, for example, about the lack of a freedom on the back seat.
These complaints are there, because the dimensions of the kombi is designed in such a way that not even zweimetermänner suffering.
Soon further
The internal resources I start by briefly, in order not to repeat myself.
It is a very successful design, where I only because of the poor central tunnel reservations.
I would like a little more designe# criminal organisation, where the car is otherwise a very elegant impression.
The seat is convenient, and the time is over, where we may well be short of beschwerten seats and head restraints.
Also, of course, the back towards the 206 has improved substantially.
As for the space, can also be compounded here if the size of the market.
In the kombi too has already been mentioned, is the lack of their freedom.
In the boot suitcase
The main thing is that car but the loading area.
The, I must aufklappbaren (the window backwards as well and beladbar platzsparend.
The areas are a restraint belts, equipped with a perfect compromise.
They affect not, auseinanderziehen and are also more severe objects.
However, we are talking about the loading volume.
It is under the table in the basic structure of 428 litres in comparison with the competition is a rather average value.
Not, however, in relation to the car sold in the Czech Republic offer this class, the fabia Skoda combi.
If we take the 207 sw with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot at hefty 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or in a child car invite this value is already critical.
However, I must stress the positiva nor the after the umklappen of very shallow loading area or the very low loading kante.
120 PS in four ranks
Our test vehicles with a vierzylinder- was 1.6 litres with benzinmotor's cylinder capacity and an output of 88 KW.
And, quite frankly, there should be a 1 600 kubik- engine, propels familien-hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and a good way forward.
If I compare Skoda with his counterpart in the works, as would sometimes be with a auspuff lappen blocked, then I can only be impressed by it.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of the car is not just volkstümlich.
Nevertheless, we must remember that we have a well-funded car with a geräumigen innneren and a very good engine have tested.
The basic price of vehicles with the 1400er in petrol engines of SEK 329900 is still on.
With our engine costs from 410900 Crowns which is quite a lot.
The allocation of the premium is proposing test car again with an extra SEK 80000 effect.
However, we have had difficulty airbags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic scheiben# wische# raus# solution, electricity and the fensterheber and...
It is costing a total of SEK 531900 car pure and simple.
That is a lot, but do you anticipate the supplementary budget of a fabia together and they will arrive in a very similar amount.
Therefore the decision, it only remains to be chosen which brand.
