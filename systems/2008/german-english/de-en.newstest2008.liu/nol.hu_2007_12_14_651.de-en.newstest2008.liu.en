Continental days are not widely holidays
In Hungary are holidays carefully regulated by law, so that the practice of the umdisponierens working days around the holidays, however, has now been established, robbing us less such next year.
In the EU and in America, it goes without saying, 'holiday'.
The Hungarian legal distinction between public holidays and working free days.
Labour free days are mostly church holidays, or are in connection with major historic events.
For example, we are celebrating neujahr: both the last day of the old, and the first day of the new year, working free days alone - the latter for the silvester-feiernden can rest.
Throughout the year, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The public feiertage, on 15 March, the revolution of 1848 and reminded of 23 October, the day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, the political establishment, on 1 May, the work on 1 and 2 November we remember our deaths.
In addition, there are two holidays, pfingsten at Easter and Christmas.
As our Heads of State, nationhood or religious holidays rarely come to a weekend, the practice of 'arbeitstags- postponement' in the cases where we stood before or after the day would only work for one day.
The price of the extended weekend, however, is that we, on the samstagen to work very well, or in the school must go.
When this day, before or after, at the end of the day, will be worked for many years by the Labour Minister in a regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and -nehmer, for public officials and officials of the public service as well.
Are only exempted companies and institutions, in which the operation without interruption, and therefore also of the public holidays.
Today, the organisation of work only by the end of the year, slightly confused with effect from 24 December, the life formally here at home, as most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the economic balance of time to leave suspended.
In the next year more holidays in the weekly centre, or at the end of the week, so that the working days will be less umdisponierungen than this year.
First the calendar around the day of the work 'upside down', so that the people of the same four days in a row can stay at home.
Saturday, 26 April will be a working day, so that the Friday, 2 may be a day of rest.
The second umdisponierung is linked to the day, on 23 October, on Saturday, 18 October on the Friday, we will have to deal with 24 October in advance.
The end of the year will, however, completely in the name of public holidays are from 24 December, after all, to stand still, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
