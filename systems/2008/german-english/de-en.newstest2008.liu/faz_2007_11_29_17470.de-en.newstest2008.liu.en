This is not warhols boxes
Who the concepts of Sweden and wood trunk unites, think of Ikea, but not in Andy warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, in Sweden fabrizierte wood cases of dark shadow over warhols list of materials.
A large part of the vierundneunzig there brillo- boxing listed by the 'type Stockholm' are counterfeiting.
After the Swedish newspaper a few months' expressen doubts about the authenticity of Andy warhols brillo- boxing of 1968, stirred up internal investigations in the moderna museet in Stockholm, now a sobering results: the six 'brillo- boxes', the director of the former museums# pontus Hulthén's speech the moderna 1995 museet Constantine, vermacht are - and perhaps also copies of the large proportion of around one hundred further brillo- boxing of the 'type of Stockholm' on the international art market are in circulation.
The background is a verschachtelt confusing circle of artistic and kuratorischer productions.
Warhol 1964 introduced in New York, his first 'brillo- boxes "bemalte wood boxes on the rot-blau-weißen design of cardboard boxes of the seifenpulvers' brillo '.
An exhibition of its work in the moderna 1968 was museet - with warhols agreement - hundreds of brillo- of cardboard boxes: these were (from cost reasons), but warhol were not delivered directly from the brillo-kartonagenfabrik.
It is not art works, but their role models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, warhol 1968 has probably given permission to produce a few brillo-holzkisten in Sweden, but not in the moderna issued museet.
Zeitzeugen are now talking of about 15 cases at the time, the original andy- authorised warhol- brillo- boxes with the term 'type of Stockholm' is correct in the arts and auction history.
Some of them have at auction reached more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that the legendary director museums# Hulthén's speech pontus falsely claimed later, there are around one hundred cases of wood in 1968 and produced in Sweden has been issued, the warhol then have left to him.
Indeed, hulténs 105 everything in Malmö until 1990, for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
At this stage warhol three years was already dead.
I heard, byström chefkonservator at the moderna museet, in addition to the six museums# own brillo- boxes three from the Swedish private possession, two of which were drawn up in Stockholm in 1968: its pressing span# records were first and grundiert, abgeschmirgelt was then with a White ölfarbe task pinsel.
The structure of the copies from 1990, however, reveals that the colour with a painter role without grundierung directly to the pressing span# had been also want - it is not oil, but acrylfarbe.
'these cases have not been authorised by the artists and if the official list of Andy warhols brillo- boxes' can be removed, the director of the moderna, museet Lars, nittve stated: 'If the' Andy warhol type authentication board 'in New York, not to a different conclusion, the moderna the museet six boxes in its collection as copying / display classify' material.
Back in July, the authentication board has announced that the serious accusations', which, in terms of the seifenpulver- boxes.
However, since we are in unerbittliches there remains silent.
