The hellish Venus is the world zwilling
Venus, despite their life is hostile atmosphere of the world than has so far been similar thought: the European spacecraft Venus express', 'lightning in the atmosphere and wind upset in Poland, as also in the winter in the world.
For almost three decades scientists indicate that Venus blitzt.
Now, the European sonde 'Venus express' the evidence - they sensed electromagnetic waves in the margins of the atmosphere: the lightning on Venus shooting of a level of around 56 kilometres of cloud to cloud, Christopher Russell reported by the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific journal.
According to the famous' ursuppen- theory 'lightning life on earth: to create storm in the ocean reactions, have suggested to the education of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: 'If ever there were living in them, it must have been very early history, declared by the Solomon Sean Carnegie institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of the Venus barely alive: the atmosphere is nearly a hundred times as the poet, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degree.
'The Venus is perhaps the vicious zwilling throughout the world, but it is a zwilling' Russell said.
Why the Venus, the earth in mass and size is just such a completely different development has taken, is the fundamental question of the esa-mission.
The start of 'Venus express' in November 2005 was a milestone for the venus- research, because since the beginning of the 1990s, no more sonde for research into this planet.
The latest research results, which is now in a number of 'nature', presented -artikeln underline the researchers believe that not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They show that the characteristics of our neighbouring planet with the earth are greater than was first thought, shares the ESA.
So, the researchers in addition to the already well-known vertebrate wind in the North Pole a cloud concession to the s√ºdpol, which is still very much.
The phenomenon of air flows at the irdischen winter hemisphere, writes a research team by Giuseppe piccioni of the Italian Istituto Di astrofisica spaziale e fisica cosmica.
The second central planet of the solar system is almost the same as the earth and is 12.100 kilometres in diameter almost exactly the same size.
The as morgen- or evening star described in less than 225 days planet under the sun.
It is much more slowly but with themselves: a venustag takes 243 earthly days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar in the earth, hardly researchers claim that both planet under very similar conditions have been created.
On both there has been the water, on the ground, was on the oceans of Venus but in the space was lost.
And while carbon dioxide on the ground, karbonatgesteinen it makes on Venus most of the atmosphere.
