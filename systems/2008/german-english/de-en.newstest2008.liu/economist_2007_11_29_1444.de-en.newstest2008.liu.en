Everything is open
Mitt romey said that he is not worthy of a presidential candidate, of a white man to be consulted.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency, in the end of a debate on youtube in the ordinary voters on video issues and to submit them to send the candidates.
None of the questions on Wednesday evening, 28 November, were raised as ridiculous as the white man, Democrats on the global warming in the debate youtube speak of the other party.
But the issues, and the answers, this time spiegelten exactly the state of the republican party in the elections next year.
It is not known as the producers of CNN, the debate, mitunterstützten the potential candidates youtube zeigenden clips auswählten.
However, in the first half hour of debate, the longest the individual issue has been devoted to the issue of immigration in the heart.
The issue is one of the most potent issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of hybrid electorate a flat wähl# to operate, if you have heard that they liked things: the television station said intensity of the agreement as the candidates strictly on the borders of languages.
The strictest and longest exchange between rudy Giuliani was the evening, the national leaders, and romney in the crucial polls in iowa and new Hampshire forward was.
The image of companies' shackles tried Giuliani, he is flexible with regard to illegal immigration, when he was mayor of New York.
It romney attacked the former governor of Massachusetts accused of a crime, illegal immigrants for work on his house to cease.
The two, particularly formidable apart as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates' Amnesty '(the illegal a regular status and the opportunity to the citizenship) would support would be.
Relatively unimportant candidates as Duncan hunter, a kalifornischer members of Congress and Tom tancredo congressmen, a Member of Parliament from Colorado, has been able to press on this subject.
Neither of the two men has serious opportunities in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they earlier and more than other on the immigration pauke gehauen.
At least in the area of immigration in the candidate countries share the same views: tougher limits, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, the republicans help the differences between liberal and Christian Conservative to forget or to emigrate.
However, the debate has been clearly problematic than other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he arms restrictions have supported in the past.
John MacKein and romney debating whether simuliertes drowning should be regarded as torture.
One of the questioner asked whether the candidates every word of the Bible.
This meant that the Giuliani arguing that although the Bible privileged paper, it should be the history of jonah and perhaps not quite literally, think of Europe.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Now huckabee Mike - contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
As he has been pressed, whether they are in favour of Jesus, he said lachte and intelligent Jesus was in order to apply a political office.
The race is exceptionally wide open.
Huckabees rise in iowa, together with Ron pauls recent spendener# consequences and his beifalls# storms in the debate by Wednesday.
These two are hochgeschossen from nothing, because the two wing of the Party not to one of the better known and more traditional candidates.
In the year 2000, and a candidate from the outset, the party and convincingly, together with winning a message on the size of the USA and a zwinkern on both arms of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
