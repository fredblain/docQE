Climate propaganda
As the debate on climate change both the sceptics of climate change, as well as those who are in the social and political debate, on the basis of a brutal criticism, must make the whole movement as a strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement that, as in the case of the intergovernmental President Zapatero, the fight against climate change is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even,  proposes a new contract with the planet to conclude .
This proposal, however, will make him in erklärungsnot concerning the action or lack of action on the part of his government, which has played a decisive role in Spain, that within the EU at the top of the list of the countries to which the provisions of the Protocol kioto- least.
Who is responsible for the failure to comply with the requirements of the sectors, and this is due to its government, which is why the  Treaty with the planet  proposed that this development cannot be stopped.
It is also now, forced the Spanish citizens provided for the measures to combat climate change outright.
What businesses will be affected by this behaviour on the part of the citizens, which is to be changed, the individual and collective austerity measures need to be carried out and the economic consequences.
To be more specific, those who are victims, and to save the planet will pay.
However, there are and there will be no such declarations in the future.
It is precisely because it is the aufopfern and pay for it.
Because the measures against climate change in real terms are unpopular can be used.
They are free, and inconvenient for much of the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the proposed by the Spanish benzin-cent Zapatero election in strategic terms, so dangerous that he had to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now the planet with nothing, in other words with pure propaganda and empty chapter to save without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, committees and committees, protocols and new posts.
With its agreements with the planet, the otherwise so appropriate politicians for electoral campaigns, or not yet, however, instead of the challenging expenditure, to add the meeting and with its sanftmut and goodness other.
But this will only happen if the agreement differs from its purely virtual nature and therefore also claims that the bicycle is not the only means of transport in the future, or we will only with a range erfrischen.
