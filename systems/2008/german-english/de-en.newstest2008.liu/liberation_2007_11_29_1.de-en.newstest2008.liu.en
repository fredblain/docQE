For a teddy# bears a name, there was now a court in Khartoum.
After indication of its prosecutor, the British teacher in Sudan, because insult of Islam, was charged on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion.
The British six to seven years of pupils, allowed a teddy# bears the name of Mahomet, although any description of the Islamic prophet is banned.
They would have to ausgepeitscht it deserves.
After several times parents of pupils in the Sudanese kultusministerium had been complained to the 54-jährige primary school teacher to the unity of the high school of Khartoum, on Sunday at home and taken up in Article 125 of the Sudanese criminal code to the insult of Islam.
In fact, this matter at the beginning of September, as the teacher by its resumption of a name calling seven-year pupils in the class select Teddy.
Children are the  eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed , Robert boules head teachers.
Finally, as the class, 20 by 23 votes for children as favourite first name Mohammed.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but also a very frequent forename in Sudan.
Then the children have a paper on the class, drawn up with the photograph of the bears the signature and my name is  Mohammed .
The bear even bore no shield with this name, but the problem is simply that the presentation of Islamic guides will be regarded as an insult of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues from Gillian Gibbons have said, of the same school in Sudan, informed, you well know, and you would never have had done something, as it is a religious faith, to  I only regret that it has asked for the children, to vote in favour of a name , in its view, this is a   innocent mistakes.
An opinion which many pupils of the teacher in these areas, as  very sensitive to their pupils and  as  person never in the class  describe talking about religion.
It should be noted that the forename Mohammed, at the same time, the most common in the United Kingdom's second name is accommodated in English, on the other hand there are 14 different ways.
This often Muslim families selected forename is regarded as a sort of homage to the prophet (it is often the erstgeborenen) given a family.
But what are the rules in relation to the use of this vornamens?
We must, for example, be it a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
