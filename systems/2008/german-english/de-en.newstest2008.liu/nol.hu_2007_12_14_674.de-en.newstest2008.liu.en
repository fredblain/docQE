Political capital Hungarian guard of increased risk.
In the view of the department for risk analysis section) (risk analysing the activities of political capital in this August, with the support of the movement for a better Hungary 'formed Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and of the region in several respects.
In the report risikowarnungs- 'of the Institute stated amongst other things: in the context of the activities of the Hungarian guard, the highest political risk the tightening up of the existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and nicht-zigeunerbevölkerung in Hungary, even in the short term, lead to violent ethnic conflicts'.
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, probably at the provocation of such a debate, so that research institute.
As has already been mentioned, this will be a failure on the part of the political leaders: considered 'persons of public life, the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groups, who are now left to their political strategy at the Roma ungarn- contrast have built'.
It is believed that this will exacerbate the problem, the sensible dialogue, foot injuries, and the likelihood of violent clashes would increase.
This means forschungsinsitut ausserdem, the activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, 'the image of Hungary abroad, especially as substantial damage confidence in the stability and democratic maturity.'.
Let us remind ourselves that, since the autumn of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary in the recovery and continuously since summer 2007, 'a number of national defence club founded' organisations have been singled out.
These groups' common characteristic of each define as a civil organisation, while you open to claim that its Members - sometimes armed - defence tasks (for civil protection, national defence, ordnungshütung), in the name of the ineffectiveness of the police, the army, or the State itself ', it said.
Furthermore, all of this is in accordance with the method, the attempt to the various different political and party apathy of the population, based on political aspirations to camouflage as civil initiative.
The emphasis on the civilian nature and the association, not just to the circumvention of legal obstacles in the course of the entry on Court which might arise at the same time, it is a political strategy.
As the analysis is observed, the activities of the Hungarian guard, which is also a risk factor for relations with neighbouring states.
In recent months, the Hungarian guard in several neighbouring States quoted as a potential source of danger, some extreme nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries in the creation of the Hungarian guard against the confirmation of its own policy ungarn-.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region, it said.
From the point of view of the research institute is the creation of the Hungarian guard is not an isolated phenomenon in zentral-ost-europa, so the political risk for the entire region.
As has already been mentioned, the activities of the Hungarian guard with which the Bulgarian national guard, whose establishment in August 2007 from the extreme right Bulgarian National Union (bnu) has been announced.
In the light of the creation of the Bulgarian guard, the roma-massenausschreitungen in some districts of Sofia (krasna poljana).
The bnu, the incidents at the reason for the establishment of the national guard, taken with the argument that the objective of the organisation of the 'national protection'.
Your opinion, namely in the last 17 years of a 'gypsy terror' in Bulgaria, felt by the state, and has, however, remained indifferent as political resources.
Furthermore, the initiative should have a heated debate in the Bulgarian public losgetreten.
As I said, the increased risk for ethnic conflict is also shown by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced their own guards to resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian guard has many similarities with which the Bulgarian national guard shows, it is likely that the Hungarian Roma also organise, with their own protection at the threats, at the risk warnungs# report by political capital.
Attila, juhász director of research in political capital said to question the intelligence agencies: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and should be clear risk changing trends will inform the public opinion, as in the case of the provision of risk warning report.
