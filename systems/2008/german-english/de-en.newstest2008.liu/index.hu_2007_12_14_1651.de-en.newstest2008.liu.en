It is widely used to save
Today, more than a thousand infections in hospitals, registered in an improper use of antibiotics were due.
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the surfeit of personnel - the tide of all factors that are not necessarily the infections, such as the chief doctor of the national epidemiologie# centre.
It is widely used in the right.
In the traumatologie- department of the jános hospital has recently been diagnosed in a mrsa- infection.
The antibiotic-resistant is possible in a male patients, found after a serious accident in hospital.
The patient is isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here.
The people of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, the man who had, however, with a mrsa- infection, to return to an important operation since then, because of the bakteriums still in the body of the patients, is still not being carried out.
By 10 December of this year for hospitals 1094 resistant strains infections caused by multinationals in the national nosocomialis surveillance system, so to speak, the chief doctor of the national epidemiologie# centre, karolina böröcz.
So many resistant strains infections caused by multinationals in the hospitals have been registered with safety so that the number of unreported cases is higher.
Around two thirds of the infection (683 cases), the mrsa, against methicillin-oxacillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
The staphylococcus aureus (SA) is possible, approximately one third of the people in their nose, without that it would cause a disease.
Sa-bedingte infections (such as hals#, entzündung almond, entzündung inflammations of skin or tend to react wounds) Well, they are well curable antibiotics.
However, the funds are too high or incorrectly applied extent, due to the good respondierenden antibiotic resistant bacteria, under appropriate conditions in the hospitals quickly.
Particularly in patients with geschwächtem, or for bad funktionierendem immune system, but also in the elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria serious infections, such as wund# infection or blood poisoning, therefore, sepsis.
The medical head of the hospital jános according to the mrsa- infection is nothing special, these events are among the kranke# House of daily life.
It should not confuse the epidemic, manhte tibor nyulasi - there is mrsa not only there, where they are not.
Resistant to antibiotics
'these patients in isolation, nursing staff will contribute to empty shoes and masks of supplies, and we have the necessary for the treatment of antibiotics' - so tibor nyulasi.
In its entering the hospital at the patients mrsa, however, does not always an infection cannot be avoided.
Very rarely sampling
The majority of the infection triggered by mrsa in hospitals, however, would be avoidable if the current conditions and circumstances detrimental to the control of the creation or the spread of the multinationals, böröcz karolina resistant anthrax.
After this infection found in hospitals and retirement homes, which should examine the hospital with eingelieferten patients and isolate infected mrsa- immediately.
In the Hungarian hospitals, the microbiological samples but not so often.
Not least because on the part of the public health insurance fund is no support for this study.
The majority of cases, therefore, would only come to light the patient, if a bemerk# mrsa- infection, that has the medical head of the epidemiologie# centre.
On the part of the European Union, there are strict recommendations on the use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures.
Antibiotic treatments will be targeted, that is to say, microbiological studies are necessary so that no resistance to the resources can be, however, this directive of hospitals, not always respected.
Under the ambulanten, or in the basic needs of patients are microbiological sampling, even less so karolina böröcz.
The cuts are being made used
Scientific evidence demonstrates that a mrsa patients on the other most of the staff.
That is why the handwashing just, or the wearing of gloves and masks a great importance, however, there are also considerable shortcomings in this area in hospitals.
By mrsa infection contact, or rather in the domestic hospitals, but not always the possibility to isolate the infected patients.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds, just one, although it is ranked between epidemiological point of view, from a distance of at least 1.5 m.
As karolina further böröcz points out, it is unfortunately less well placed in the financial hospitals even before that used to be saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that actually favour the emergence of infection.
Such infections are much less often proven, or the further spread of the infective agent inactive cannot be reversed, where these protection measures are complied with, böröcz karolina.
Against mrsa intergovernmental programme
Mrsa- infections to get to grips with the health insurance caused enormous costs, it will therefore be combatted everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of mrsa, or their containment in the legislative programme.
The first signs the programme is successful, as published data show that the trend is the mrsa- infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC), the prevention of the emergence of big resistant cause (including mrsa), and the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities.
