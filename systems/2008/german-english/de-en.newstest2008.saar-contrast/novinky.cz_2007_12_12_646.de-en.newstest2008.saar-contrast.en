Test Peugeot 207 sw: voruteile fades
In order to say the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its handling characteristics were not much value, the quality of the gear shift, the guidance and also the processing could one as rather designate below average.
Now but his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and this is about much better.
The combination with the designation sw is still a piece of further and only remains for me to revise my opinion.
As I had tested the classical hatchback 207, I had to me, for example about the too small on the rear seats.
There are now no longer these complaints, because the body combination is formed in such a way that not even suffer.
Quickly further
I go through only shortly, in order not to repeat me too much.
It is a quite excellent design, where I have only because of the miserable central tunnel's objections.
There I would welcome a little more designerische organization, where otherwise the car makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable and are the times past, where perhaps we complained about to short seats or head restraints.
Also the side has fundamentally improved in comparison with the 206.
What the room supply concerns here as well, one can feel the increased dimensions of the body.
In the station wagon is also the already mentioned lack of, is eliminated.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main point at this car is, however, the cargo hold.
I must (also because of the reverse window) as very well beladbar and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with safety belts, which represent an ideal compromise.
You do not disturb, make itself and hold even more difficult objects.
But let's talk about the case volume.
It amounts to according to table in the basic equipment 428 litres, which in the comparison to the competition is a rather average value.
Though not in comparison to the vehicle of this class, the Skoda fabia combi.
If we the 207 sw with the new generation of the product from Mlad√° Boleslav, compares we determine that the Peugeot around clearly perceptible 52 liters.
For a foreign vacation or while inviting a pram this value is already critical.
But in order to emphasize the positiva, I must still the loading space completely flat after turning the cargo hold or also the very low loading up edge.
120 PS in four rows
With our test car was with a four-cylinder capacity of 1.6 litres and a performance of 88 KW. Equipped
And honestly said, so should have a look, which propels a family.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Skoda, which sometimes works, as would be its exhaust with a rag clogged, then I can only be inspired by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not just national.
However, we must remember that we are a well equipped car with a spacious innneren and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400s gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns still concerns.
With our engine it costs as 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment quality of the test beats still once with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
We had however bags, automatic air conditioning system, automatic windshield wiper electrical window lifters behind and and...
So the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
That is a lot, but you calculate once the additional equipment fabia together and they will arrive with a very similar sum.
Therefore only remains the decision, which mark one wants to choose.
