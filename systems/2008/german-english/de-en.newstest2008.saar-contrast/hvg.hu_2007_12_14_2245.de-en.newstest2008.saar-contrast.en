Six as a deterrent, in order to annoy colleagues
E-mails which we forget to send, messages, which we never receive - harmless lies, the US don't notice any more: they bring "color" in the everyday life on the job.
The question is whether one becomes accustomed to these small used, or provides one better to the challenge and attempts this misleading, for other angry situations consciously.
Tips.
"sorry, I have forgotten to pass on to you that someone from the marketing department called" -- a colleague says.
That one has missed a meeting through?
At best one regrets it and tries it again when maybe one phones the marketing department and admitting, one would have forgotten to align the message (this is the less usual method).
Is usually the thing with an excuse. Dismissed
Before one involves oneself in embarrassing excuses, one should consider, with which one his colleagues can truly prepare unpleasant moments, and try to avoid these situations intentionally.
Something lent, which does not belong to one?
There is hardly something sinewy as if one after a document, or the telephone, but it is not there.
Yesterday the notebook device still lay on the desk - it is today? away
Or lost believed ball-point pens for instance on the desk of a colleague? discovered
Without one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow, because they are annoyed, if they determine that something got away.
Thus, no covers or mail from the office put into the bag, because it could meet: no more there, if one's nevertheless urgently needs.
Gossip about the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means, a gossip, which was already put into the world. To stop
Who with whom?, which made
Where and why?
The one should information (or assumptions) about the private life of the colleagues after possibility not every tie to the nose!
And if someone opens and his innermost secret betrays us, we should not abuse this confidence!
Best one is silent as a grave, instead of just not present to pass on, even if others about the problems of the colleague also know.
Without reason ill? reported
If one calls in the office, under reference to tormenting headache to ill, report because one just feels uneasy, or simply would only like to rest, one should himself about one: to realize the own work, urgent, projects with firm dates must now the colleagues instead of one themselves.
Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore!
If one knows already on the day before that one it on the next day not into the office will manage, or that something could get in the way, why one must remain at home, one should announce it in time, so that neither the colleagues, still the leader unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Hum,, giggle, telephoning
One is hollow just in his work, however, is suddenly by the loud giggling of the colleagues? disturbed
Unintentional a telephone conversation overheard that one better should not have heard?
One should not the colleagues with sums, singing, loud discussions (the one leads over their heads), trample, continuing grumbling or nerves.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just in a task (write, plan, organize) recessed.
Are always the other? blame
Is a project is not ready in due time, one has an important letter or important realigns forget to send, one should not the fault of the own forgetfulness at other! search
As far as possible one should not on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
Best one admits his errors, and apologizes, if others were affected also by it!
The question, how one the error again, or which missed retrieve can, is only too made!
In the office - a feeling like to home?
Pants and schlapfen: comfortably for at home, but lost nothing in the office!
Not even then one should dress so casual, if it would actually permit the job!
Only not to become too - one should both his colleagues, as also themselves even as far as that respect one dresses accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
