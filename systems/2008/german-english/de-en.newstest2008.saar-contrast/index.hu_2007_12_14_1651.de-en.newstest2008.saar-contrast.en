In many places at disinfectants
This year more than one thousand infections in hospitals were registered, the due to inappropriate handling antibiotics. Were
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overflow of the beds, the overload of the personnel -- all factors, the the embankment of the infections not good at all, so are the leading doctor of the national epidemiology Center.
In many places also with the disinfectants.
In the traumatology-department of the to hospital recently an mrsa infection was diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient, after a serious accident to the hospital. One was
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, a little later had the man, however, with a mrsa infection to return. An important operation could since then because of the bacterium which still is in the body of the patient, not yet to be carried out.
Until December 10th this year were from hospitals activated by virus infections initiated at the national nosocomialis surveillance system, so the leading doctor of the national epidemiology Center,. Karolina
So many infections released by multi-resistant exciters were thus registered in the hospitals with security, but the true figure might be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were by the mrsa, the staphylococcus aureus resistant staphylococcus aureus. Triggered
The staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium contributes about a third of the people in their nose, without that it would cause an illness.
SA limited infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) usually react well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
The means are however measured out too high or used inappropriately, arise from the well respondierenden bacteria antibiotics resistant, the under appropriate conditions in the hospitals. Spreads fast
In particular with patients with weakened, or durably badly functioning immune systems, but also in older, or patients with a low body weight these bacteria can cause heavy infections, such as infection or blood poisoning, thus sepsis.
The medical director of the to hospital, according to the mrsa infection is nothing special, such occurrences. Belongs to the
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, tibor nyulasi - there is not only there, where it is not searched.
Resistant to antibiotics
"such patients are isolated, the nursing staff carry rubber gloves and masks with the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - so.
With their admission into the hospital will the patients examined, nevertheless an infection can always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of the infections in hospitals triggered by mrsa would be avoidable, however the currently reigning conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the containment of the origin or the spreading of the virus, says.
After this infection mainly occurs in hospitals and homes for the elderly, the taken patients should investigate and mrsa immediately isolate.
In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not practised, however, so frequently.
Last but not least because it on the part of the national health insurance company no subsidies for this investigation.
The most cases would come to light before then, if the patient has already a noticeable has, so the medical head of the epidemiology Center.
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there are, however, also in Hungary to guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be, this means microbiological examinations are necessary, so that no resistance can form against the means, however this directive of hospitals are also not always kept.
Under the ambulatory, or in the basic supply the patient microbiological sampling are even still rarer, so. Karolina
One saves with the disinfectants
Scientific evidence proves that mrsa from a patient on the other the most frequently by the nursing staff will transfer.
Just therefore the manual washing, or the carrying of gloves and masks are of a great importance, however, there are also on this area considerable shortcomings in the hospitals.
Mrsa is transmitted through droplet infection or contact in the local hospitals, however, There isn't always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds connected barely although it between them from the epidemiological view, a distance of at least 1.5 meters. That should give
Like karolina keeps on saying, it happens unfortunately in the financially less well placed hospitals even that with disinfectants is saved, it gives few nurses, many patients - all factors, which almost favour the emergence of infections.
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there and / or the further distribution of the virus can be stopped where these protective measures are adhered to, so. Karolina
Government program against mrsa
In the mrsa grip to get the causes Health insurances enormous costs, therefore they are fought everywhere.
In England for example, the prevention of mrsa, and / or their containment was held in the government program.
After first signs the program successfully -- as published data prove, the tendency of the declining in England.
The European Center for disease prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the emergence of viruses (under that also mrsa), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities.
