Which insurance is suitable for me on? the best
The motor vehicle insurance which a possible claim caused by the driver, covers contains a high cost, whose height of depends on various factors, among other things of age, sex, time of the preparation of the driving licence, family status, kind of the cars to be insured and its use, etc
To own a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the fitting motor vehicle insurance as the correct vehicle model.
First of all it must be clear to one with what we have to do it here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is in writing by means of an versicherungsvertrags were recorded, which specifies that the society receives, and in exchange is engaged with a case of loss the appropriate sum paid in compensation.
The premium is the price of an insurance consists through several factors, among others age, sex, time of the preparation of the driving licence, family status, kind of the vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance set their prices according to the statistics, so that with a more severe danger of accident also higher payments are due.
For this reason both via women less contribution payments achieve, because statistics prove that these groups thanks to their caution. Show a smaller accident rate
The same also applies to married people, since this according to statement of the statistical values and therefore also after conviction of the enterprises, to fewer accidents tend as singles.
The use, which is attached to the vehicle impairs the frequency of the driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more probable the damage.
With the list of the bonus the insurances must take into account a whole number of points.
For this reason the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance, the most likely approaches his personal needs.
We list at this place is now the most important points, the one with the selection of an insurance should take into account, in order not only a power-, but also a choice oriented. To be able to meet
Under 25-year old meet with the choice of a low-priced insurance numerous obstacles, such as the small driving practice and the "young" driving licence.
Even if it is for an ideal insurance cover would be the best to sign a full, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can select a full hull with, so that the achievements of an indeed fully covered, but offered at a low price.
This kind of contract includes that the customer a part of the amount that resulted by the damage himself. Must pay
"the amount will before conclusion of the contract and based on the height of the insurance premium. This is more highly ever smaller the sum", explains Luis Noguera, main agent of Spain with Europe, for a mediation. On-line
Another option is the extended insurance, the the customer against external damages, not however against the harm arisen at the own car.
In addition, this type of the insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here. A Council
If you are under 25 years old, it lies in your hand to lower the cost of insurance; so your credit increases itself when trying to drive carefully and to avoid accidents.
A credit is a lowering of the base rate at the corresponding insurance company.
In the opposite for this purpose a payment a rise of said rate.
"the height of credits and punishing payments hang from the society and their returns.
If the enterprise has a rich year behind it, can permit itself to increase the bonus ", explains.
As soon as the 25-year exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to sign a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving the accident rate sinks.
Thus, it is the most sensible for a full comprehensive insurance with. To decide
"normally the young people can not profit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident than also at the time of the driving not", describe the Spanish chiefs of the European enterprise, and adds that the majority of the accidents in the second occur, after the "fear of the beginner" was put down.
Nevertheless, it is the case of a married customer, doesn't have any children to effect a fully comprehensive insurance; naturally only then, if it the financial situation of the appropriate person. Also allows
On the part of the insurers, married couples with children as the customers with the lowest accident rate, and correspondingly low as well from its payments.
In this case would be a full comprehensive insurance with (at an amount by the 300 Euros) the best option. In the case that one received a high credit, has recommended an extended insurance, the first to the third shows commitment.
"they travel altogether more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power, which permits it to them, a higher payment of dues to set", determine Luis Noguera.
For pensioners it offers itself, with a full hull (at an amount by the 150 euros), or an extended insurance, to conclude, the only at a sufficiently high credit.
Finally one must observe that the car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damages, but also because they high costs, which require it, that a thorough selection is met, which corresponds to our personal situation.
