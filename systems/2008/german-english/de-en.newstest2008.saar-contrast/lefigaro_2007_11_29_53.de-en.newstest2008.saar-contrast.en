Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott parazynski and his comrades of the crew of the international space station (iss) will more than seven hours in the area, have used the spectacular repair of a defective solar, carry out for the continuation of the scientific work on the station is indispensable.
A daring exit, on the basis of its duration, the distance of habitable module, the speed with which it was organized, and the one of the astronauts tools, in order to carry out the repair, several record achieved.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts the module harmony of the Space Shuttle discovery, had a big cylindrical part that soon the European and Japanese scientific laboratories. Should receive
This module is a kind of jetty for the laboratories.
But one must be able to supply it with river.
The second task of the crew, it was therefore a 17.5 tons heavy module for the current generation via solar collectors, which was already on the turn over, in order to bring it into its final position.
After she had moved it, the crew made itself to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module, whose span amounts to 76 meters.
And in this case, it happened that one of the collectors, which itself as accordions, let through a jammed cable on a length of approximately a meter was damaged
The restructuring was stopped, in order not to damage the collector still more.
The astronauts, the originally the Space Shuttle discovery for an abandoned and then another collector, whose rotation system was incorrect should repair, saw itself forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott parazynski was selected at the end of the 30 meters long remote-controlled arm of the Space Shuttle, which been mounted on that of the station was round in order to carry out the repair.
He is one of the best spacewalker (wetraumg√§nger) of NASA.
Large, resistant, very skillfully, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46 skilled doctor was therefore selected, the "hurt" solar collector "operate".
After he had examined the damage exactly, it cut the faulty cables and attached a kind of rails on the damaged place.
It was of a second "spacewalker, of the in the proximity of the inside, supported, and, from inside, of the other astronauts, among them Peggy whitson, officer of the crew.
The tool, which he used, a mini-hockey with insulator tapes, around on the solar panels which produce several hundred volts, an electric blow to prevent, had the astronauts on board the station devised and "tinkered".
When the action was terminated, Scott parazynski waited until the collector was completely folded, before he his tools and swept back to the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts enjoyed diversion half a day, before today, seven astronauts on the space shuttle back to most likely Wednesday the return flight to the earth.
