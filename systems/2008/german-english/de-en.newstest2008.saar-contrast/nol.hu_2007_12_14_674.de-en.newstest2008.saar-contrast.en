Political capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk
According to the department for risk analysis (risk division) of political capital the activities in this August with support of the "movement for a better Hungary," Hungarian guard founded the risk of Hungary and the region in more respect.
In the "risk" of the Institute of it means among other things: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk represents the "aggravation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary, even at short notice could lead to violent ethnic discussions."
Main reason for that is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, which supposedly on the provocation of such a confrontation aims, according to the research institute.
As reported, will this as a failure on the part of the politically responsible persons: looked at "persons of the public life have the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political grouping, which now their political strategy on the have built up".
One suspects that this intensify the problem, the rational dialogue impossible extremities favour, as well as the probability of violent quarrels would increase.
The forschungsinsitut means, the activities of the Hungarian guard would have, not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the local and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad substantially, in particular, what the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity." affects
We remember: since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary continuously in the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several, "national self-defense association" organizations were founded.
"these groupings it is common that they each case define themselves as civilian organization, while they boast openly about their members on - sometimes armed - Defense tasks of preparing (disaster control, national Defense,), under appointment on the unsuitability of the police, the army, and / or the State itself,", it was said.
And further: that everything happens in accordance with that method, which tries, different, on the policies and of the population, based, political efforts as civil initiative. To disguise
The emphasis of the civilian character and the association therefore serve not only the evasion of legal hurdles, in the course of the registration with Court -- could emerge, it is at the same time a political strategy.
Like to be inferred from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk factor also for the relations with the neighboring States.
"in the last months, the Hungarian guard was in several States as a potential source of danger, quoted so many a politician of certain neighboring countries sees in the emergence of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own. Anti
That everything has effects on the political stability of the region "- it was called.
From the viewpoint of the research institute is the establishment of the Hungarian guard is not in, thus the political risk for the entire region grew.
As reports, the activities of the Hungarian guard with those of comparable to the Bulgarian national guard, whose foundation in August 2007 of the Bulgarian's National Union (bnu). Was announced
In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian guard the stood the riotings in a district of Sofia (krasna poljana) have taken place.
The bnu has the incidents equal to the cause for the establishment of the national guard, with the argument that the aim of the organization is the "national protection".
According to their opinion was indeed in the past 17 years a real "terror" marked in Bulgaria, the state however remained idle and indifferent - so political capital.
And further: the initiative would have an intense debate in the Bulgarian public. Kicked loose
As said that the increased risk for ethnic discussions is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard to reasons.
There the activities of the Hungarian guard so far many similarities with those of the Bulgarian national guard shows it is not to be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma likewise, with the organization of their own protection to react to the threats it is called in the risk of political capital.
Attila juh√°sz, Director of research with political capital said on request of the report: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Every year would be published annually and should is tendencies be recognizable, the public opinion is informed, as in the case by the publication of the risk.
