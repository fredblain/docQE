These are not warhols boxes
Who the concepts of Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not at Andy warhol.
? or however
Currently raise in Sweden dark shadow on warhols.
A majority of the ninety-four listed there of the "Stockholm" are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "expresses" some months ago doubts about the authenticity of Andy warhols of of the year 1968, has stirred up internal inquiries come in the moderna museet in Stockholm now to a result: the six "boxes", which the former the of museum moderna museet 1995 as donation has bequeathed are copies -- and presumably also the major part of the another about one hundred boxes of the "Stockholm", which are on the international art market in circulation.

1964 created in New York its first "boxes", painted wooden, which are on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the "brillo". That
An exhibition of his works in the moderna museet 1968 issued - with warhols agreement - hundreds of brillo from cardboard: these weren't (from reasons of cost) of warhol, but they were delivered directly from the brillo-kartonagenfabrik.
It wasn't around works of art, but their models, around bare exhibits.
At the same time warhol 1968 probably the permission, some produced few brillo wood crates in Sweden, to let the though were not exhibited in the moderna museet.
Contemporary witnesses are talking now about fifteen boxes which then as authorized original-andy-warhol-brillo-boxes with of the name "Stockholm" to right in the art and auction history.
Some of them have more than 100 000 dollars on auctions. Obtained
The problem is now that of the legendary director of Museum has claimed later by mistake, it is in 1968 about a hundred boxes in Sweden was produced and issued to him then left.
105 boxes were only 1990 actually in Malm√∂ for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.

Lars bystroem, chief curator at the moderna museet, along with the six museum boxes also three from Swedish private property, of which two were made 1968 in Stockholm: their chipboards were primed and ground first, afterwards was White color with a brush. Applied
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 however tells that the with color without a painter coat directly on the laminated was applied - in addition it concerns not oil-, but around color.
"these boxes were not by the artist and should autorisiert from the official list of Andy warhols boxes be removed", indicates the director of the moderna museet, Lars announce: "if the 'Andy warhol kind authentication board' in New York to another conclusion does not come, the moderna museet the six boxes in his collection as copies / classify."
Already in July, the authentication board has admittedly announced, to follow the "heavy accusations" in the area of the soap powder boxes are raised.
However since then, one himself there in relentless silence.
