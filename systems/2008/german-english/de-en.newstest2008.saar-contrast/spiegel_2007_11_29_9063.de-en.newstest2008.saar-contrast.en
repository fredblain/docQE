Venus is the twin of earth
The Venus is despite their anti-life atmosphere of the earth as a similar ones so far meant: the European space probe "Venus express" has flashes in the atmosphere and eddies at the Poles were discovered, as they arise in the winter also on earth.
For nearly three decades scientists assume that it flashes on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus express" produced the proof - they tracked down electromagnetic waves on the fringe of the atmosphere: the flashes on the Venus fire in a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud to cloud, told Christopher of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "nature".
According to the famous "ursuppen-theorie" lightning the life on earth develop: thunderstorms shall have activated reactions in the ocean, which led to the formation of amino acids, the components of the life.
Not so on the Venus: "if there were ever lives there, it must have been in the very early history", Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington.
Today there might on the surface of the Venus hardly give something lively: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on the earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus is perhaps the of the earth, but it is a twin", said russel.
Why the Venus, the the earth in mass and size so similar, a so entirely different development, is the basic question.
The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research, since since the beginning of the nineties no probe more specifically for the Exploration of this planet. Was on the way
The latest research results which now in several "nature", be introduced after emphasize view of the researchers not only the uniqueness of the Venus within of the solar system.
"they also show that the common characteristics of our neighbor planet with the earth are greater than first accepted", communicate with the ESA.
So the researchers found next to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, also a vortex at the, the still substantially faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the terrestrial winter hemisphere, a team of researchers writes about Giuseppe piccioni of the Italian Istituto Di astrofisica spaziale e hemisphere.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers. Almost just as large
The also described as a morning or planet circles in just 225 days around the sun.
But he concerns a lot slowly themselves: a lasts 243 earth days.
Although the Venus with temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds of the earth, scientists assume that both planets had arisen under very similar conditions.
On the two water collected, which remained on the earth in oceans, on which Venus however lost into the area.
And while carbon dioxide on the earth in carbonate rocks, makes it on the Venus, the majority of the atmosphere.
