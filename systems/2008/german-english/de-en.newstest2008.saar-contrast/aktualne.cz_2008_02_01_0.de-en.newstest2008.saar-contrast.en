Fraudulent broker risked because of feelings of inferiority billion
Bottomless swindler
So describes his former employee of the French bank giant Société Générale owner the local banka.
They came because of him around almost five billion euros.
However, it seems rather so that Générale was only a large player, who wanted to do it like his colleagues beyond that surely not was unable.
To the difference to all large banking houses it recognized in time the crisis. At the amerikanischenn mortgage
"It is psychologically rather weak," was from the mouth of his superiors to be heard, who reported it to the police.
Like however from the statements, the result, the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, published, he was a human being, at the end of last year with its business of profits in the amount of 1.6 billion euro had obtained.
Crisis not only in America
"everything I wanted was for my bank, to earn money," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he had managed just at the American crisis to earn half a billion euro.
The opportunity in addition he had already indeed at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were already first messages over that so-called mortgages as they low-income customers or such, who had already in former times, are given in difficulties would be fallen.
Influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis however.
Générale didn't believe this and was right.
At the end of the year, he had his profit up to 1.6 billion euro.
"already than I had earned the first half billion, I did not know, as I should explain that," admits and continue to say that he has kept nothing definitely for itself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he falsified documents, so that one would not come him to the pulps.
He even succeeded to lead its bosses behind the light, even if the gradually, for eurex interested in its business.
Risk profit
Feared he to be exposed?
Probably scarcely.
"I thought, that they the simple fact that I have earned 1.6 billion for the Bank, satisfies."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
In the Société Générale it occurred in the year 2000, immediately after he his study at the University of Lyon, had ended. A
His annual salary amounted to about 51000 dollars.
After two years, he was already assistant of a broker and in the year 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he will never earn as much as others.
"already during my first conversation in the year 2005 I knew that one watched me.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, "explained the investigator.
But already soon after its entry the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance he earned much, by setting at the London bomb attacks half a billion euro losses on exchange of this title.
And that was the trigger -- he wanted more now.
As long as you make profit, we let you
"this is like a snowball," he told the policemen.
But the bosses knew allegedly from everything, and / or suspected it.
"as long as I earned money, one closed the eyes."
But then came at the beginning of this year. The great blow
On a single day he lost a billion euros.
At a weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to balance that.
When he came to work on Monday, he was already not more employees of the Bank.
And a few days later the Bank announced that it lost five billion euro on his account.
And how they came on for him? the tricks
It looked suspicious through a vacation.
"I have only four days from the previous year.
A broker, who takes no vacation is one, which does not want that one sees for him in the tickets, "said definitively.
