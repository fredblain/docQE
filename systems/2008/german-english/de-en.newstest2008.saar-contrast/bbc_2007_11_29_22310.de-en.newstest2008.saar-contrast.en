New fears over natural gas controversy between Russia and the Ukraine
A new price quarrel between the Ukraine and Russia, which increases the danger that Russian exports of fuel are impaired to Western Europe.
The largest part of the Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) is conducted by the Ukraine and every argument between the two nations is watched very exactly.
Kiev has warned that if the Moscow the price that it must pay for the natural gas increases, it from Russia higher transit charges into account will put.
A former conflict between the two states in the last year reduced supplies in the European Union states.
The latest quarrel between Kiev and Moscow happened at a time, to which the Ukrainian Government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom try to achieve an agreement about it, how much the Ukraine for Russian natural gas in the year 2008. Must pay
According to Gazprom, more must be charged to the Ukraine, since the company agreed up to 50% for natural gas from the neighboring Turkmenistan to pay.
Analysts say that this could mean that the Ukraine 40% more for the imports of Gazprom. Must pay
"It is important for us, our arguments as one of the most important in the case of conversations to use", said the Minister of economics of the Ukraine of the news agency Reuters.
"The changing natural gas prices should certainly be connected with our arguments regarding the amount of the transit charges [to Western Europe] over the Ukraine."
In the last large natural between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 cut Gazprom deliveries in the Ukraine.
This led in consequence to a case of the exports to Western Europe, which drastically pushed the prices in the height.
Russian gas constitutes a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the world's largest gas deposits but much of this remains underdeveloped.
The consequence is that Gazprom completes its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
