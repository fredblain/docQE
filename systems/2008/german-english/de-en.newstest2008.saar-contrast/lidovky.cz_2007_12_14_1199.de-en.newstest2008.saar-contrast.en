Budget is through
Yes, it is created.
The national budget is approved.
What is special one at this budget?
It is the first budget which this government has designed and without the support of the opposition by the coalition was accepted.
For the current year was still with support of the cssd (social democrats), approved because it Minister sobotka (of this party) had submitted, and the cssd could not allow it therefore rejecting him.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence against the government nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Parliament approved this traditionally few paid attention to, nevertheless highly important law in all peace.
This is to a certain extent paradoxical.
Rules over everything begins and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the budget, whether one likes this or not.
The budget is an essential component of the politics, however, is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
That is for the media a more grateful topic, and therefore they devote more attention to him.
A controversy among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober numbers.
The national budgets suffered at the past social democratic governments under three weak points, which the budget for the year 2008 not on once: can eliminate
The first is the high share of expenditure because of law obliging, at which it is not only about the pensions, but also about social expenditures, which the "silent" coalition of cssd and ksm (Communists) in the last year before the elections has concluded.
The second is the account budget policy as a result of the first.
The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the local authorities.
The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and one javelin measures under control.
However, a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the local authorities.
Many mayors spent, about except incomes from taxes, taxes and bank credits further sources for investments, often mostly from bonds, by which they caused their city halls in the excess.
In the last years, they succeeded, these debts by massive sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks, the them in the train had received from the State to pay off.
Now is this source already dried up.
As far as we ourselves only at official and verifiable facts, we notice that:
Our economy for some years, like the rest of the world, a growth through, whose the cssd incessantly himself boasts.
This represented a unique possibility for their governments to take public finances into order.
Instead these governments were to blame for the state, however, still more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt have much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a giant disgrace which mainly be ascribed to the former governments.
We belong to the countries, which, in the global scale, seen at the least of poverty are threatened.
Therefore no nassiven social programs are necessary, which unfortunately just in the last few years quite in gigantic extent was blown up.
Even if it is successful, a part of the unreasonable populist expenditures, which were adopted this year before the elections, to paint, is clear, that if it does not come in next time to a shift of the pension entry age and to a pension reform comes, then virtually any politics in this country, and, very now who is in power, he will not have anything as a pure administration.
It is only easily exaggerated, if one says that then from ruling politicians officials become, the largest part of the tax revenue mechanically up on pensions and social expenditure.
Therefore the this year's budget can not be a revolution, but can only to the displacement of normal expenditures by duty areas.
The deficit provided for 2008 of 70 billion Crowns would be quite superfluous if earlier governments in the last ten years would have not distributed, which only went.
If we don't want that it really comes to that from ruling politicians pure verwaltungsbeamte become, then we must be patient and this is not too strong coalition government, however, which is conscious that the state can spend only so much, as it is at taxes and fees to take in the situation is quiet at the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these make a gradual penetration of a balanced national budget.
