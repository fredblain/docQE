Banks want to cope with crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided together against the crisis on the financial markets to fight.
So more than 100 billion dollars by means of auctions on the currency markets.
On these auctions, the banks auction of interest rates, to which they are ready to lend each other money.
For example the American fed sends 40 billion dollars on auction, further 24 makes it for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.
It is after the assaults of the, is the first time that the central banks of the individual States agree on such a coordinated procedure for the defense and / or reducing the consequences of a financial crisis.
"this step is to remove the greatest difficulties of the economy, thus the increasing lack of freely available capital, which the banks can lend," wrote in a report for its customers Bernard pool of the consultancy firm economic outlook group.
"the coordinated action of the central banks reduced the probability of a recession in the USA of 65% on about 50%," added in his report.
The banks have because of not operated credits already around 60 billion dollars, primarily in the United States.
Analysts expect still further losses.
"" the central banks really must have been afraid of it, which still everything can follow, when to this procedure decided, "said the economist of ABN AMRO, kieran Davies.
"It appears that the situation is really bad," he further said.
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have access to loans, credits even more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce the consumption and the American economy into a recession, possibly with effects on the growth in the whole world.
The central banks have decided, after they had not succeeded, the so-called libor, lower the rate of the used with the moneylending between banks.
This means that the banks had constantly fear, to lend each other money and that although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the autumn had lowered their interest rates repeatedly.
"this will have the same effect as a further lowering of the interest rates," said Greg salvaggio of tense consulting of the Agency Reuters.
Some analysts are of the opinion that this step of the central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, and indeed the case of the property market in the USA.
