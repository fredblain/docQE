Budget is through
Yes, it is created.
The national budget is approved of.
What is special at this household?
It is the first household, which this government sketched, and which without support of the opposition by the coalition majority one accepted.
For the current year still with support of the?SSD (Social Democrats) one approved of, because it Minister Sobotka (of this party) had submitted, and which could not take the liberty?SSD it therefore to reject him.
In contrast to the lively debate before the tuning over the motion of no confidence against the government this time nothing dramatic happened.
The Lower House approved of this traditionally little considered, nevertheless most important law in all peace.
That is to a certain extent paradoxical.
All governing begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the household whether pleases or not.
The household is a substantial component of the policy, however covered by the struggle for power of the government and the opposition.
That is for the media a more grateful topic, and therefore they dedicate more attention to him.
A controversy among politicians is many more interesting for the public than sober numbers.
The national budgets suffered at the past social-democratic governments under three weak points, which the household can eliminate for the year 2008 not at one time:
First is the high portion of expenditures, which are because of obligating of law, whereby it does not only concern the pensions, but also around social expenditures, which the "tacit" coalition of?SSD and KS?M (communist) decided in the last year before the elections.
Second is the defizitaere budgetary policy as consequence of the first weak point.
The third restriction exists in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budgetary deficits of the municipalities.
The largest risk is not however the national budgetary deficit.
This household is public and eingermassen under control.
A true time bomb is however the budgetary deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors spent, in order to open except incomes from taxes, deliveries and bank credits further sources on investments, often inconsiderately debenture bonds, by which they were to blame for their city halls in the oversize.
In the last years it succeeded to them, these debts by massive sales of shares of the energy and of different supply networks, which had received it in the course of the privatisation from the state to pay off.
Now is this source already triumphs.
As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we state that:
our economics already for some years, how the remainder of the world goes through, a growth phase, whose the?SSD without omit yourself praises.
That represented a unique possibility for its governments of bringing public finances in order.
Instead these governments were to blame for the state however still more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, kept house many more reasonably than our republic.
That is a giant dishonor, which is to be attributed predominantly to the former governments.
We belong to the countries, those, in the global yardstick seen, to few by poverty are threatened.
Therefore no nassiven social programs are necessary, which redundant-proves unfortunately straight completely in the last years in gigantic extent was blown up.
Even if succeeded, a part of the unreasonable populist expenditures, which were adopted this year before the elections, to paint, is clearly that if it does not come in next time to a shift of the pension entrance age and to a pension reform will remain, then ends practically any politics in this country, and, equal to who in power is whole, for it nothing as pure administration.
It is only easily exaggerated, if one says that then from dominant politicians officials become, who divide the largest part of the tax receipts mechanically on pensions and social expenditures.
Therefore the household of this year can no revolution be, but can only to the displacement of normal expenditures by expenditures for obligation stop order.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns, planned for 2008, would be quite redundant, if former governments had not spent in the last ten years, which only went.
If we do not want that it comes really to the fact that from dominant politicians pure civil servants become, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, that is aware however of its that the state can spend only so much, as it is at taxes and fees to take able peace during the preparation of further reform laws to wish.
Only these make possible a gradual penetration of a balanced national budget.
