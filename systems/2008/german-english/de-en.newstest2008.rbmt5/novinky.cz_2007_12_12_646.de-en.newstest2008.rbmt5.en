Test Peugeot 207 SW 1,6 VTi: Voruteile shrink
In order to say the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its handling characteristics were not much worth, the quality of the gear shift, the steering element and also the processing could one as rather designate below average.
But its successor, the Peugeot 207, is now on the market, and that is better around much.
The combination with the designation SW is still another piece further, and for me remains only to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classical Hatchback 207, I had to deplore myself for example over the too small head liberty on the rear seats.
There are not these complaints now any longer, because the body combination is in such a way arranged that two-meter men will not even suffer.
Fast further
I go through the interior equipment only briefly, in order not to repeat me too much.
Concerns a Design quite succeeded, where I have objections only because of the miserable frame tunnel.
There I would welcome somewhat more designerische organization, where the car makes otherwise a so elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times, where we possibly weighted about to short seats or head restraints.
Also the side stop improved opposite that 206 substantially.
Which concerns the space offer, one can feel the increased dimensions of the body also here.
In the combination also the lack of head liberty, already mentioned, is eliminated.
Suit-case into the trunk
The main thing at this car is however the loading space.
I (also because of the opening by hinges rueckfensters) must call that very good loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with straps, which represent an ideal compromise.
They disturb not, can be pulled apart and held also heavier articles firmly.
But we converse about the load volume.
It amounts to according to table in the basic equipment 428 litres, which in the comparison to the competition a rather average value is.
However not in the comparison to the vehicle of this class?koda the Fabia combi usually-sold in Tschechien.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mlad√° Boleslav, we state that the Peugeot stays around clearly noticeable 52 litres.
For one foreign vacation or when inviting a buggy this value is already critical.
But around the Positiva to emphasize, I must mention still the loading space completely flat after turning the rear seats down or also the very low ladekante.
120 HP in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with capacity of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 KW.
And honestly said, then a 1600-Kubik-Motor should look, which propels a family Hatchback.
It is quiet, has a small consumption and moves away well.
If I compare it with its counterpart with?koda, which sometimes works, as if its exhaust with a rag would be clogged, then I can be only inspired by it.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not popular straight.
We must remember however that we tested a well equipped car with a roomy Innneren and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400er petrol engine at a value of 329900 crowns still concerns.
With our engine it costs starting from 410900 crowns, which already quite much is.
The equipment Premium of the test car strikes again with 80000 crowns additionally to beech.
We had however Kopfairbags, automatic air conditioning system, automatic windshield wiper release, electrical window lifters in the back and and...
Thus the car costs altogether smooths 531900 crowns.
That is a quantity, but sums up you once the zusatzausstattung of a Fabia and you with a completely similar sum will arrive.
Thus remains only the decision, which mark one wants to select.
