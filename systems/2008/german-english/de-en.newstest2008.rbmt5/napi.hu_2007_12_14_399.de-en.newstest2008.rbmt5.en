With the party-faithful voters the difference precipitates clearly owing to the high determination of the opposition proponents: More than two thirds (71 per cent) face fifth (20 per cent) agreement for the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are according to inquiry under the parliamentary entrance hurdle: They come in the total population on two per cent.
The number of party voters grew in both bearings by a per cent.
In the comparison to the last tiefpunkt the general economic tendency continued to worsen - the portion of those, which judge the economic situation of the country as "expressed badly", was so high never before (41 per cent), while they regard further 46 per cent "rather bad" as.
After hope-fuller prospects in the spring and summer the families see the change of their financial situation again more pessimistic.

Thirteen per cent of the asked ones have large confidence or confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the portion of the proponents for Viktor Orbán constitutes 38 per cent.
Approximately 54% do not trust the head of the government at all, compared with 27% distrust against the party chief of the Fidesz.
