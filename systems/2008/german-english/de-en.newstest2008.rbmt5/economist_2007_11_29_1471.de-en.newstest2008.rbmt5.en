Map sharks
Does the credit crisis stick on America credit card market?
If blood is in the water, is it is only natural that dorsal fins whirl excited.
Now where of Americas is ailing property market, the raubtiere have the credit card market of the country in the visor.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs count on the fact that the credit card losses could 99 billion dollar reach, if the infection danger of under-financed credits spreads on other forms of using credits.
Signs of the strain are clearly visible.
There are rises both with the writing off and with the default rates, which measure the portion of the credits, which are too late not in each case retractably or more as 30 days.
The HSBC announced in the last month that she took 1.4 billion dollar collection of charges from their American consumer financings, partly because of the weakness of credit card takers.
It is nevertheless too early, in order to purge in panic.
Losses and defaults are still low.
According to the Ratingagentur Moody almost was the third quarter default rate of 3.89% a full per cent point below the historical average.
The degradation with the rates can be explained partially by technical factors.
A change in the American private insolvency law laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of declarations of bankruptcy, which constitute again for a large part of the Keditkartenverluste; the number of registrations (and thus default fees) again it would rise whether the general conditions for applicants for the credit worsen or not.
The industry reports also of solid payment rates, which show, how much of their debts the consumers pay to each month off
and the confidence into credit card-based securities is rather strong, despite the stop in other corners of the structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research enterprise, counts on the fact that the expenditure quantities will be higher for 2007 in the long run 25% than last year.
There are surely direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more probable that consumers take up credit card debts, now that home of one's own credits drain.
The map exhibitors look however on the cash flow instead of on present values, therefore falling house prices release not necessarily a change in the credit-worthiness of the applicant for the credit.
They can be of advantage even for the map exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers for paying the raterate rates further sink, if the real estates are less value than the value of the loan; as result the map debts under the repayment priorities become more important.
Map exhibitors can react also many faster and more flexibly than credit givers to the stormier conditions, by changing interest rates or credit borders.
That should reduce theoretically the risk of a fast re-valuation of net assets.
"we will wake up not a daily and the loans evaluate completely again", say Gary Perlin, Capital Ones main financial adviser.
Even if a sudden understocking crisis is improbable in the credit card market, the risks of a lasting wing over are substantially material.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction America will certainly stand into the recession urge, the industry before a grimmigeren future.
Hold they for far look out for these shark fish fins.
