Richard Gere is simply not zynisch enough
With "The Hunting party" and "Moerderi peace" are occupied again two films with the Balkans war.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts set too much on Action and Geballer or however them are too agitate blessed.
There also Richard Gere in "The Hunting party" cannot help.
The good message first: The war criminals Karadzic and Mladic hide themselves still in the mountains of the Balkans, but just there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, now the actor Richard Gere was regained.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties-years last, because all too many nice-inconsequential roles in well-being feeling films for women and all too many press conferences drove the desire out on Hinsehen about Buddhismus.
Now is Richard Gere sudden the most important argument, itself "The Hunting party - if the hunter to the chase becomes" (why to have film titles today actually always as long and confused to be as engine driver collective agreements?) to regard perhaps nevertheless.
It supplies a marvelously augenzwinkernde representation: Strictly speaking its war reporter Simon Hunt is what from Gere could have become, if the fate and the filmbranche were not so benevolent: A man, who has its very best times for a long time behind itself, who retained its fall still considerable remainders of the former charm however even as ruin-same monument.
But despite this trumpfes "The Hunting party" sets the endless number of failed Balkans war films together with the German production of "Moerderi peace", which likewise starts in this week, only away.
With "Moerderi peace" one can make short process: The film acts of two German soldiers in the Kosovo (Adrian Topol, max of Riemelt), which saves a Serbin from kosovarischen snipers, on which the one promptly also still with her falls in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are here once not explained as exclusive root of all evil, the televisionflat film loses itself all too fast in Geballer and Action.
A kind "alarm for Cobra 11" remains without motorway however for it with war.
On the other hand can be investigated at "The Hunting party" almost exemplary, why it did not give actually ever a correctly good Balkans war film.
Perhaps the history of three US war reporters, who open themselves, in order to seek out the Serbian upper war criminal "the fox", could have become with another director and another film script author (both in personnel union Richard Shepard) to another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories resemble each other striking: Both marks go small teams into the forest, in order to achieve somewhat, what military to be able and both marks does not become it a journey into the insanity.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting party" is that one does not let Simon Hunt be simple the heruntergekommenen cynic with heart, when who is presented he us at the beginning.
No, the Script must it in addition still another romantic affair with a late murdered Muslim Bosnierin andichten.
Finally "The Hunting party" does not go then the brook down, if within the last five minutes in the quick-motion apparatus procedure succeeds to the reporters, what NATO, CIA and all head money hunters of the world in five years creating: The war criminal catch and the Muslim Bosniern to the fair revenge left.
That is so bad that one would like to call the international Court of Justice into the Hague because of crimes against the cinema logic.
The film has a deeply human request.
It wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic rumlaufen still freely, and it does not suspect the Americans and the Frenchmen (here they are to be exeptionally times united) pursuit due to secret political arrangements too to operate intensively.
But well the meaning and the bad are sometimes so similar itself that a famous breaking poem comes into the sense.
Therein it means over the holzmaske of an asiatic Daemons on the workbench of the poet: to "I see the swollen front veins suggesting Mitfuehlend,: like it is arduous, to be bad ".
Films like "The Hunting party" have exactly such swelling heads, however suggest, like it are arduous to be good.
The problem is not limited to the category of the Balkans war film.
Recently it is in this newspaper reports that all Iraq films Hollywoods were large flops.
One can add: It did not give also ever a good South Africa film.
Nearly always applies: If a star on the crisis centres or mine fields of the world roams itself, then comes as thereby raus as "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "the other world of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamond" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all the conflicts are temporally simply still too close.
Decades had nevertheless to offense, before Hollywood with "Schindlers list" could turn a good film over the Holocaust.
Some film will probably still mature - those as classical authors of valid Viet Nam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal jacket" were not celebrated at that time now by any means unanimously as masterpieces.
Perhaps but we know today, where each mass murder comes into real time on equivalent two screens at home, also simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And the Bedenkenlosigkeit, which needs it, in order to tell good stories, robs from the film script writers.
"its or Nichtsein" or "the large dictator" became so good finally also, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet, how badly the Nazi regime really prevailed.
Perhaps one may not want to be good, if one wants to make good films.
Perhaps one must have the sarkastisch dissociated artist view of the Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk.
When to parallels between its historical novel "Lempri√®res was asked the dictionaries" and the Balkans war, he answered: "it is only because of the fact that some things never change.
Large cities will be always terriblly dangerous, humans become in greyful way to be always murdered and to war in Yugoslavia will always prevail."
