Which insurance is suitable for me best?
The KFZ insurance, which takes one off of the driver caused possible case of loss, contains a high cost, whose height depends wiederrum on different factors, among other things from age, sex, time of the production of the driving licence, family status, kind of the car which can be insured and its use, etc..
A car to possess is only the beginning.
Because even more with difficulty the suitable KFZ insurance is to be found than the correct vehicle model.
First of all it must be clear one with which we have to do it here.
An autoinsurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurant.
This agreement is held in writing by means of an insurance contract, which specifies the fact that the society receives the agreed upon insurance premium and is in response obligated to submit with a case of loss the appropriate sum paid in compensation.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance, for which by several factors builds itself up, among other things. Older, sex, time of the production of the driving licence, family status, kind of the vehicle which can be insured or its use.
The insurance companies determine their prices according to the statistics, so that with a higher danger of accident also higher payments of dues become due.
For this reason both over 25-year old and women fewer payments of dues carry out, because statistics must prove that these groups exhibit a smaller accident rate owing to their caution.
The same applies also to married persons, there these according to statement of the statistic values and therefore also after conviction of the enterprises, to fewer accidents bends like unmarried ones.
The use, which is attached to the vehicle, impairs the frequency of driving and concomitantly the probability of an accident.
The more frequently the use, the more probably the damage.
With the list of the premium the insurance must consider a whole set of points.
For this reason also the driver must study the situation thoroughly, in order to select exactly the autoinsurance, which comes to meet its personal needs earliest.
We do not only list the most important points, which one should consider with the selection of an insurance here now, in order one achievement -, to be able to meet but also an price-oriented choice.
Under 25-year old meet with the choice of a low-priced insurance numerous obstacles, e.g. the small driving experience and the "young" driving licence.
Even if it were best for an ideal insurance protection to lock an insurance against all risks there are nevertheless more inexpensive alternatives.
The careful drivers can select insurance against all risks with self participation, so that the achievements of an insurance against all risks are covered, but offered for a low price.
This kind of contract contains that the customer must pay a part of the amount resulted from the damage.
"the amount is specified before conclusion of the contract and on the basis the height of the insurance premium. This is more highly the smaller the sum which can be paid ", explains Luis Noguera, general agent of Spain with roofridge Europe, a switching enterprise for on-line insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damages, not however against the damages developed at the own car.
In addition this kind of the insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here an advice.
If you are old under 25 years, it lies in your hand to lower the cost of insurance; thus your credit note increases, by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit note is a lowering of the basis tariff with the appropriate insurance company.
In the opposite in addition contain a punishing payment a rise of mentioned tariff.
"the height of credit notes and punishing payments depend their yields on the society and.
If the enterprise has a yield-rich year behind itself, it can take the liberty to increase the bonus payments ", describes Noguera.
As soon as the 25-Jahre-Marke is exceeded, it is to be locked for the drivers more simply a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving experience the accident rate sinks.
Thus it is most meaningful to decide for an insurance against all risks with self participation.
"normally the young people can draw no use from their past experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of driving not", describe the Spanish chiefs of the European enterprise, and add that the majority of the accidents in the second practice practice occur, after the "fear of the beginner" was put down.
It is more advisable nevertheless at a married customer, who does not possess children, to lock an insurance against all risks; naturally then only if it also permits the financial situation of the appropriate person.
On the part of the insurers married couples with children apply as the customers with the smallest accident rate, and accordingly low also its payments of dues fail.
In this case an insurance against all risks with self participation (with an amount around the 300 euro) would be the best option. In the case that one received a high credit note, is recommended an extended insurance, which begins only to the third vehicle year.
"you drive altogether more relaxed and possess a larger purchasing power, which permits it to them, a higher payment of dues to set", determine Luis Noguera.
For pensioners it offers itself, an insurance against all risks with self participation (with an amount around the 150 euro), to lock or an extended insurance which begins only with a sufficiently high credit note.
Finally one must note that the autoinsurance is somewhat very important, not only, because she protects the driver from possible accident damages, but also, because she saves high costs, which require it that a thorough selection is met, which corresponds to our personal situation.
