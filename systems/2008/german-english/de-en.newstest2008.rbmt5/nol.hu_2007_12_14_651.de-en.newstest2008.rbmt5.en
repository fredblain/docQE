Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are regulated legally exact, so that the practice of making new arrangements the working days was meanwhile established approximately around the holidays, however give to us the coming year less such days.
Also in the European Union and in America one understands something else by "holiday".
The Hungarian juridical system differentiates between state holidays and work-free days.
Work-free days are mostly church holidays, or stand with important historical events in connection.
We celebrate New Year for example also: Both the last day of the old, and the first day of the new yearly are work-free days - thereby the latter alone the Silvester celebrating to rest itself can do.
In the whole year we have altogether fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are 15 March, which reminds of the revolution of 1848, and which 23 October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August the establishment of state, on 1 May the work, is celebrated on 1 and 2 November thinks of we our dead ones.
Beyond that there are ever two holidays to Easter, Whitsuntide, and Christmas.
Since our state -, national or religious holidays on one weekend fall rarely, the practice of the "working day shift" worked satisfactorily in the cases, in which we would work before or after the holiday only one day.
The price of the extended weekends is however the fact that we very probably work on Saturdays before it or into the school to go must.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be processed finally is specified, since long years by the employment minister in its own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and takers, to public employees and officials of the public service equally.
Excluded are only companies and mechanisms, in which the enterprise without interruption, thus also at the holidays, is continued.
This year working rules is only brought somewhat in disorder by the holidays at the year end: Starting from 24 December the life in this country stops formally, since most for the days between Christmas and Silvester time reconciliation, or which particularly for it waived vacation take.
In the next year fall more holidays into the week center, and/or on the end of the week, so that it will give fewer changes of plans at the working days, than this year.
The calendar is placed first approximately around the day of the work "on the head", so that humans can remain equal four days at the piece at home.
Saturday, which will be 26 April one working day, thereby Friday, 2 May one quiescent day can.
The second change of plans is connected with the holiday on 23 October: On Saturday, which 18 October one will process Friday, 24 October first must.
The end of the yearly will be located however completely in the indication of the holidays, after starting from 24 December everything remains lying and standing, even if Silvester on one Wednesday falls.
