Everything still openly
Memo Romey said, it did not keep it worthy a presidency candidate by a schneemann to be asked.
Nevertheless the republican explained itself candidate for the presidency in the long run ready to place itself to a debate on YouTube in which normal voters questions on video accepts and submits, in order it the candidate to send.
None questions, which were at the Wednesday evening, which 28 November, were raised, as ridiculously as the schneemann, which asked democrats over the global heating up in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this mark exactly the condition of the republican party, which breaks open into the elections in the next year.
It is not well-known, exactly like the producers of CNN, which every now and then-supported the debate, which to YouTube showing tie-clips selected the beginning candidate.
However in the first half hour of the debate, which was dedicated longest to an individual topic, immigration stood in the center.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters a dial to serve, if they heard things, which pleased them: The TV organization noticed points of the agreement as the candidates strictly about the borders spoke.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national outrider, and Romney, which pushed themselves forward in the crucial inquiries in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake the call off, it regarding illegal immigration was flexible, when he was a mayor of New York.
It attacked Romney in which it the former governor von Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for work on its house to have adjusted.
The two argued particularly violently as interrogators asked whether one of the candidates would support a "amnesty" (would give the illegal ones a regular status and the possibility on the nationality).
Unbedeutendere candidate such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressional representative, and Tom Tancredo, a congressional representative from Colorado, succeeded to after-hook it with this topic.
None of the two men has serious chances with nominating, but both remain in running, perhaps because they gehauen in former times and harder as others on the immigration bass drum have.
At least within the range of the immigration the candidates divide on the whole the same opinions: sharper borders, intolerance opposite illegal Migranten.
This topic, together with fears over poisonous toy from China or other concerns over the remainder of the world, helps to forget the republicans the differences between liberals and Christian conservative ones or minimize.
But the debate was brought clearly problematic as other topics to the language.
Mr. Giuliani was asked, why he had supported weapon restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be regarded as torture.
One the interrogator asked whether the candidates believed each word of the Bible.
This led to the fact that Giuliani held the point of view that although the Bible was its preferential book he the history of Jonah and perhaps literally did not believe the whale.
A further interrogator asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations at the first place in a recently accomplished inquiry in Iowa owing to its Christian conservativism existing for a long time - said that the death penalty was necessary painfully, but.
When it was pushed on it whether Jesus would endorse it, he laughed over and said Jesus was too intelligently for itself for a political office to be applied.
Running remains unusually far open.
Huckabees ascent in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls recent donation successes and its applause storms in the debate of Wednesday.
These two are not high-shot from that anything, because the two wings of the party could not agree so far yet on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates.
In the year 1980 and 2000 a candidate has the party from the outset and convincingly united with a victorious message over the size of America and a Zwinkern to both wings of the party.
This mark is split the party and the result is by far not clear.
