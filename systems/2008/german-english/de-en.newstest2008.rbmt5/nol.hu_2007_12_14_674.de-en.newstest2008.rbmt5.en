Political Capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk
In opinion of the department for risk analysis (Risk Analysing division) of Political Capital the activities in this August of the Hungarian guard created with support of the "movement for a better Hungary" raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several regard.
In the "risk warning report" of the institute it means among other things: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk represents the "aggravation of the ethnical tensions already existing between the gypsies and population of non--gypsy in Hungary, who could lead even at short notice to violent ethnical arguments".
Principal reason for it is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, which probably aims at the provocation of such an argument, so Forschungsinstitut.
How reports, this is regarded as omission on the part of that politically responsible persons: "persons of the public life left the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groupings, which developed now their political strategy on the Rome outer yarn contrast".
One assumes the fact that this intensify the problem, whom makes reasonable dialogue impossible extremities favour, as well as would increase the probability of violent arguments.
In addition the Forschungsinsitut means, which would have activities of the Hungarian guard, not least damaged owing to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad substantially, in particular which concerns the confidence in stability and democratic ripe ones".
We remember: Since autumn is 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary continuously in the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several were based, "national self-defense association" organizations calling.
"these groupings it is common that they in each case define themselves as civilian organization, while they prahlen openly with the fact their members up - every now and then armed - tasks of defense to prepare (disaster control, national defense, order guarding), with reference to the unfitness of the police, the army, and/or the state" it was said.
And further: All this happens in accordance with that method, which tries, different, to camouflage on the policies and Parteiverdrossenheit of the population based, political efforts as civil initiative.
The stress of the civilian character and the association form serve thus not only the evasion of legal hurdles, which could emerge in the course of the entry with court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
How is to be inferred from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk-increasing factor also for the relations with the neighbour states.
"in the last months the Hungarian guard in several neighbour states was quoted as potenzielle source of danger, so some ultranationalistischer politicians of certain neighboring countries sees in the emergence of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungary politics.
All this has effects on the political stability of the region "- it meant.
From the view of the research institute the establishment of the Hungarian guard is not a single phenomenon in central Eastern Europe, thus the political risk for the entire region grew.
As reports, the activities of the Hungarian guard are comparable to the Bulgarian national guard, whose establishment was communicated in August 2007 by the right-wing extremist Bulgarian national union (BNU) with those.
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian guard were located the Rome to eating excesses, which took place in a borough of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents equal to the cause for the establishment of the national guard, with the argument that the goal of the organization is the "national protection".
According to their opinion a proper "gypsy terror" was in Bulgaria noticeable, the state remained however doless and indifferently - in such a way Political Capital in the past 17 years.
And further: The initiative would have kicked loose a violent debate in the Bulgarian public.
How said, also proven the increased risk for ethnical arguments by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to create for resistance purposes their own guard.
Since activities Hungarian guard so far many similarities with those Bulgarian national guard shows, not to exclude is it that the Hungarian Roma likewise, with which to the threats reacts, is called to organizing its own protection it in the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juh√°sz, director of research with Political Capital said on request of the press agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis report published, and should is informed annually risk-changing tendencies be recognizable, the public opinion, as in the case by the publication of the risk warning report.
