Small Saarland, good education
The smallest Land of the Federal Republic is prominent during the professional training and shines even with the international adjustment of its universities.
Only in an education field the Saarlaender presses the same deficit as the remainder of the country.

The portion of foreign studying with 15,6 per cent is accordingly high.
But also the Saarland brings the national children in above average number to the universities - many of them without a conclusion at the High School.

So that the children in former times the last Kita year is to be learned to begin free of charge - a model, which in the meantime also different Lands of the Federal Republic copy.
Whether the achievements of the pupils improve lastingly will show, only future comparative studies.
With Pisa 2003 shrank the portion of the risk pupils of 29 to 20 per cent.
Altogether the Saarland did not increase however as strongly as other Lands of the Federal Republic.
Bavaria count better.
And to the annoyance of the Saarlaender Fremdsprachenkenntnise are not measured with Pisa - within this range one could score otherwise.
