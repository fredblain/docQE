According to Institut, who determines that the percentage rose pill user inside between 20 and 40 years, which use the pill of 5% in the year 1970 to today 60%, the liberalisation of the empfaengnisverhuetung nevertheless better "control of the fertility" made possible.
Anyhow nowadays eight of ten births are carefully planned.
With one of five pairs even on month exactly computes, and, if possible, in spring to get, which season, in which it seems most pleasant, a child.
