Venus is the hoellische twin of the earth
The Venus is more similar despite their life-hostile atmosphere of the earth than so far meant: The European space probe "Venus express" discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind eddies to Poland, how they arise in the winter also on earth.
For nearly three decades scientists assume that it flashes on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus express" furnished the proof - it sought out electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: Lightnings on the Venus shoot at a value of approximately 56 kilometers of cloud to cloud, report Christopher Russel of the University OF California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory" lightning let the life on earth develop: Thunderstorms are to have reactions lively, which led to the formation of amino acids in the ocean, the components of the life.
Not so on the Venus: "if it ever lives gave there, must have been it in very early history", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington.
Today there might be something alive on the surface of the Venus hardly: The atmosphere is approximately hundreds times more closely than on earth, it prevails every now and then to temperatures of 500 degrees.
"the Venus is perhaps the devil twin of the earth, but she is a twin", said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, hit so completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research, since since beginning of the nineties no more probe was particularly for the study of this planet on the way.
The newest research results, which are presented now in several "Nature" articles, do not only underline the singularness of the Venus in opinion of the researchers within the solar system.
"you show also that the thing in common of our neighbour planet with the earth is larger than first accepted", communicate the Esa.
Thus the researchers beside that found already admitted to eddy wind at the north pole also a cloud vortex at the South Pole, which turns still substantially faster.
The phenomenon reminded of air flows on the terrestrial winter hemisphere, writes a researcher team around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The secondaryinternal planet of the solar system has nearly the same mass as the earth and is nearly just as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
Also as tomorrow or evening star marked planet circles in scarcely 225 days around the sun.
It turns however many more slowly around itself: A Venustag takes 243 ground connection days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly of the earth reminds, scientists assume both planets under completely similar conditions developed.
On both water collected, which remained on earth in oceans, on which Venus however into space was lost.
And during carbon dioxide on earth, constitutes it is fixed in carbonate rocks on the Venus the majority of the atmosphere.
