In the Budaoerser commercial triangle increased the price of the usual Weihnachtskorbes of the "Napi" also this yearly by 16 per cent, however in all hypermarkets price increases were registered of over 1.000 HOOF.
After the prices are "away-galloped" in the food markets in past December, the price increase failed prozentuell not drastically, compared with the anyway high, earlier output level.
However it affects the consumers certainly deterring that that, for which they had paid in the last year still well under 9.000 HOOF is available this yearly not even for 10.000 HOOF.
The price of the "Napi" of warenkorbs exceeded the magic 10.000-HUF-Grenze by at least 91 HOOF in the examined markets.
The highest price amounted to 10,573 HOOF.
(in 6800 the price was with 6.800 HOOF.)
The prices for Unicum and alive fish remained almost to previous year level, strongly rose however the prices for Putenbrustfilets, nut and poppy.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data centers of the statistic office of Hungary, with Auchan gave it however to 1kg bread waking for 139 Forint.
There was no competition-conditioned collapse of prices on under 200 Forint with the product.
The price two litres of a Coca Cola pledge bottle of under 200 Forint was likewise surprising, thus cost here the beverage inclusive pledge only 257 HOOF.
This yearly in the "Napi" nevertheless cut most expensively, and Cora to goods basket comparison off Auchan most favorably.
Our computations resulted in that Cora the prices in the "Napi" warenkorb opposite the Weihnachtspreisen in the past year around 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased in each case by 18 per cent.
The difference between the cheapest warenkorb of the previous year and the most expensive heurigen yearly amounted to 12%, while the increase between cheapest warenkorb of the past most yearly one and most expensive of the current yearly constituted 21%.
The average price rise amounted to 1,480.00 HOOF.
The average price increase still was in the previous year about 1.206,00 Forint, however the value added tax increase became apparent with the prices to last Christmas.
Exactly this procedure met the trade badly: Apparent the department stores could not decide so quite, which price margin them with the individual articles to use to be supposed, since the effects of the price increase were unpredictable on the consumer behaviour.
(if the dealer the peripheral speed of a product badly plans, can he around substantial profits fall in the price margin, according to the traffic intensity arranges themselves.)
Mehwertsteuer caused the price increase of the "Napi" of warenkorbes failed in the past year in such a manner radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the difference in prices amounted to with the cheapest basket only 844 Forint.
This yearly such extremes were not observed, since the most expensive basket cost more around 1.630,00 Forint, as in the previous year, and even with the cheapest there was a price rise of 1.284,00 Forint.
In the comparison of the two last Weihnachtssaisons a catastrophic price increase, the price of the daily consumer items showed up in the hypermarkets in as 20 months around more than 30 per cent less rose.
(this again does not confirm necessarily the data centers of the statistic office of Hungary: With some basic food the statistic office in the period of 12 months determined one more than 30-prozentige price increase.
So in for instance beside flour also with eggs.)
If one throws however a view into the "Napi" to warenkorb, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the already in the previous year expensive product rose even in the worst case around hardly more than 10 per cent.
Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position, than the Eilieferanten - nevertheless they could shift the drastic price increase upon the multis.
In the golden commercial triangle the hypermarkets do not deplore themselves; It is reported constantly by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not look no more on the prices.
From all large quantities are bought, durable food go into pallets over the counters.
Wednesday morning gave it in all three department stores endless queues with the cash, when suddenly the number of the customers exploded.
However by the country a smaller customer frequency is reported, so that many multis deplore themselves with the public opinion analysts, it could not even the planned conversion achieve, not only with food, but also with lasting consumer goods.
