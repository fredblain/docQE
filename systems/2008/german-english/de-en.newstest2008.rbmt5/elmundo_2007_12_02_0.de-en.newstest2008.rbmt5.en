A colleague informs about the admission of illegal Internetdownloads in the penal code:
A. The Download of a song would be a law break, which with six months detention concerned become.
If you out-rob however wiederrum a music business under a value of 400 euro, then this is considered only as simple offence (article 623,1).
B. If you out-rob the business up to a value of 1000 euro, then the theft is criminal offence-classified as, yet the punishment precipitates smaller than with a Download (article 234 penal code).
C. If you klaust a car and it later again return forty hours, then the punishment is still smaller than with a Download (article 244,1).
D. It is to be participated less serious in a fight than in a music data exchange.
In a rebellious argument to take part a term of imprisonment of three to 12 months involves (article 154 penal code), while data exchange entails a liberty withdrawal from six months to two years
(article 270 penal code).

My family doctor presents one of his long, strange research articles with the title to me: "money leads to activation of certain brain ranges, above all, if other more of it get."
Thus the feelings resulting from the monthly salary payment depend on the content of the colleagues.
The study was provided to assistance by a tomographisch magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last expenditure of the science magazine Science.
According to statement Bernd of weber, author of the study and director Bonn brain research centers of the Life&Brain, "the activation was strongest if the participant gave correct answers and its fellow player failed however."
The researchers could recognize the fact that the brain activities failed always very moderately, if both participants with their answer lay correctly and so also the same got content; but if one of them received the double, it came also to a stronger brain activity."
I am not completely safe me whether it requires actually as much scientific expenditure to arrive at such a result.
