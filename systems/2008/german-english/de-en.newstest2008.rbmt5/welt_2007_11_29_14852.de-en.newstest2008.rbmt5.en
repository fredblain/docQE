The fathers herb skirt return
Of Germany super+'s group of the seventies makes music again: The three volume members of Harmonia again planned their consoles with a concert in Berlin.
To the Revival a Mitschnitt appears from their large time "Live one 1974".
They were substantially more famous abroad already at that time.
The fixed sensation occurs then in shape of three set gentlemen at the evening board.
Everyone has its small box before itself, its cables and above all its buttons.
Dieter Moebius thront in the bloom-white shirt with 63 years in the center.
Left flanks from Michael red ago, 57 years young and in the possession of laptop and guitar.
Right, regarded from the auditory, Hans Joachim Roedelius, curves 73, concentrated at the console.
Everyone contributes noises, every now and then even a Beat.
And sometimes it adds itself inadvertently to a conventional piece of music.
That does not seem to disturb then also the gentlemen themselves largely.
The fact that the volume Harmonia makes music again provided among herb skirt lovers for some excitement.
Whereby one may reveal here: Purposeful demands resulted in that the name did not schwirrte by the collective Popgedaechtnis, but by any means so lastingly, in order to miss this volume for 32 years painfully.
But why not also the German is to be allowed to celebrate its living legends from the seventies-years?
Particularly since what misleading herb skirt is called, was considered in England and America always more than in the own country.
When the music economy lent the survivor of the Cologne group of CAN 2003 the echo price for the life's work, one saw in the hall into asking German Popgesichter.
As also still talk yourself Hot Chili Peppers in the Laudatio with volume the La Duesseldorf and Neu! thanked you, knew the surprise no borders.
With concerts Michael squatted with talks red ago later Hot Chili Peppers on the stage like an old buddy.
The problem of the Ignoranz at home and the clarifying in the foreigner is one.
The memory is already overtaxed with Harmonia, because the Trio existed only two years and in this time also a far smaller effect power unfolded than them of others was later assigned.
Moebius and Roedelius had made music to many promising name cluster already before with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under that.
First one played in the cellar under the citizens of Berlin stagestage stage.
Afterwards in Duesseldorf, for economic reasons for a disk label maintained by the church.
With power station had helped out briefly red ago and itself afterwards as a guitarist with new!, the at that time perhaps most radical German group, a call erspielt.
Around 1973 followed red ago however the cluster musi edges in the exile after forest in the Weser mountain country.
There, in the old person Weser yard, a ruin from that 16. , they lived century as city-volatile Kommunarden.
Less ideologically than in the municipality I, where Roedelius could have trouble still as child girls.
Rather in pointed-awayful artist existence.
Also a wimpel of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein was alleged and for the art a name in the check garbage.
Some held Harmonia of it.
The first album was called "music of Harmonia" and following "De Luxe".
Because so left and modestly the music also sounded, the volume suffered material emergency.
The brushwood collecting did not serve alone the self identification.
The CD "Live ones appeared now 1974" with a concert in Griessem, before one scarcely 50-koepfigen record background was along-cut, as someone believes to remember itself.
From red ago at that time the desire came to force and occasionally practice Harmonia.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The volume explained its separation to 1975.
Its existence landed red ago with albums like "flaming hearts" in the Esoterisch spherical one and secured themselves.
Since that time cluster was animated in the Achtzigern again and is more successful, than it was Harmonia ever.
The Griessemer live album is to be owed to Herbert Groenemeyer.
Its disk company Greenland sat down it to the goal of maintaining the herb skirt as characteristic German contribution to the alive music.
Again! thereby like Roedelius solo work was already excavated.
The physical reon purchasing of Harmonia takes place in the citizen of Berlin house of the cultures of the world.
Publicly, in the context of the festival Woldtronics subsidizes.
Julian Cope is there, the Britisher, Altpunk and author of the manual "herb skirt Sampler".

With which the entire range of the influences of the herb skirt on the following Popmusik would be outlined.
Thereby the blank character of the super+'s group is filled out by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most peculiar sounds in the hall: "those only true music, it belongs the future."
There are pictures, which show the producer with Harmonia in the farmer room.
The putting formation projections of further black-and-white photos of confused verkabelten geraetschaften serve.
Before it are again with the improvisation concerned three veterans.
No more, by sticking microphones on the organ and on the schlagzeug, in order to draw from the instruments over tinkered effect devices outrageous tones.
Today the electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technical deepened Tueftler.
In it also the choir of the house does not change anything.
Under the line Barbara of morning star under sound clouds one coughs and one gewispert and in a beautiful place with Emphase "Aaaaaaaah!" sung.
Herb skirt was always a very English term.
It never concerned skirt.
The roots were looked for less in the Blues, than in colleges of music (CAN), technologies (power station) or on the escape before artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Who here "' 68!" calls, has not completely wrongly, and Harmonia cannot be brought of it still from the peace.
Still the selfmost understandable is thoroughly considered on the stage.
Where does music catch on and when does it stop?
That can rob the nerves or give volatile moments of large luck.
