Banks want to master crisis
The American Federal reserve, the European central bank and the central banks of Great Britain, which Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets.
Thus more than 100 billion dollar by means of auctions at the currency markets will arrive.
On these auctions auction the banks of interest rates, to which they are ready mutually money to borrow.
For example the American Fed sends 40 billion dollar on auction, further 24 makes it loose for the European one and the Swiss central bank.
It is after the notices 11-Septembers the first time that the central banks of the individual states agree on an in such a manner coordinated procedure for the defense and/or reducing the consequences of a financial crisis.
"this step is to eliminate the largest difficulties of the economy, thus the increasing lack of freely available capital, which the banks can lend," wrote in a report for its customers Berne pool of broadcasting corporations Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"the coordinated action of the central banks reduced the probability of a recession in the USA of 65% to approximately 50%, added" Baumohl in its report.
The banks already lost because of not served credits by 60 billion dollar, particularly in the United States.
Analysts expect still further billion-losses.
"" the central banks must have really had fear before it, which still everything can follow, when to this procedure decided, "said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"it looks in such a way that the situation is really bad," continued to say he.
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have heavily entrance to loans, for their customers of credits become also more expensive.
That would reduce the consumption and would fall the American economy into a recession, possibly with effects on the economic growth on the whole world.
The central banks decided to after they had not succeeded, which sucked. To lower LIBOR, the Londoner interbank rate, which is used with the moneylending between banks.
That means it that the banks had constantly fear to borrow itself mutually money and although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the autumn their interest rates had several times lowered.
"that will have the same effect as a further sinking of the interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of tense Consulting of the agency Reuters.
Some analysts are the opinion that this step of the central banks contributes the case of the property market in the USA to the heating of the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem.
