On the islands of the Karibik you find in redundant measure.
Only on an island you find however still much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the large Antilleses.
At present the Spaniard was Cuba their bastion for conquest America.
Kolumbus called it the most beautiful place, which one human eye each saw.
Havanna became once a camp or a transit camp of treasures, which had robbed the Spaniards in America and then to Europe transported.
And then the American epoch came.
The hotel Nacional originated in completely at the end 20. Century.
To build it left to one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that applied in the USA as crime (particularly during the prohibition), became on Cuba gladly seen and supports - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among its guests were among other things.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, franc Sinatra.
In Havanna multistoried buildings grew, over the broad boulevards drove cars, which ranked among the cult symbols of the fifties of the past Jahrhundets.
Ernest Hemingway bought a messuage in San Francisco de Paula, in whom proximity of Havannas, and in Cojímar he had his yacht to lie.
At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio star of the show Business and politician out completely their signatures left America.
And today?
At the walls of the Bodeguita of Havanna also you can leave your autograph.
At the bar in the hotel Nacional one mixes cocktails completely for you according to desire.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havanna until today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiat in salty and damp air fell apart already long.
Havanna, in particular its oldest part, may not have strongly heruntergekommen, anywhere finds one in the periphery as many marvelous colonial objects of interest here as straight.
Other places are out-deseamed straight, for example Trinidad.
In view to it that the tourism brings urgently needed money, it gave it for this development green light.
In the last fifteen years not only in Havanna new hotels developed, but also in Varadero, at the coast of the province Holguín and also on Inselchen such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and other one.
Cuba offers still another Marotte, which is singular in the world and tightens above all railway lover.
Steam and the same-trieven narrow-gauge railways brought the zuckerrohr of remote plantagen to the sugar factories.
Their vehicle park was not renewed over decades, and so one sees there putzige and fully functioning locomotives, whose lengthen contemporary elsewhere in the museum.
Trip goals
The majority of the visitors of Cuba does not omit the bedeutendendsten places.
So one does not have to write over Varadero or Havanna any longer in detail.
It remains mentioning only that in already the mentioned is messuage Hemingways a museum, whose attendance should not to be able to be escaped that, which likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most pictorial angles of Cuba.
The sumptuous vegetation grows on lime soil.
The Mogotas, lime hill and rock, rise steeply from the valley soil, in its cavities accumulated fruitful soil, by which rock ranges also weathered are covered by close vegetation.
This valley is it, where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is cultivated.
In its end form you can meet it, if you visit one of the cigar factories of Havanna.
Possibly it appears some also interesting that the Chilean consequence of the TV serial "major Zeman" was turned there.
Trinidad
An age-old city, which was created briefly, after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought you the trade with slaves and sugars.
The wealth embodied itself in decorations the beauty of the small city.
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly affected by the later French settlers, hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, between which sea and the Escambray mountains convenient, is a so remote place that there was no road, which would have connected the area with the remaining country there still in the fifties of the last century.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it remained unconsidered.
Nothing was built, but therefore also nothing torn off, for everyone was glad there that he had a roof over the head.
If one has more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worthwhile itself to regard interesting places in the environment as for instance the beach Playa Ancón or the "valley of the sugar factories".
In the evening one should go then into the Casa de la Música, which animates itself after the darkness, and where the music is not silent up to the morning.
Baracoa
Some call this small town in the east of Cuba completely the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this opinion is affected also by the way there.
Both roads, which lead from Guantánamo there, must overcome high and zerkueftete mountains and run by a landscape, which is hardly affected by human interferences.
The UNESCO took up this eastern Vorposten Cuba owing to there unaffected nature to its world inheritance listing.
There best chocolate manufactured, in church shows one cross of Kolumbus (in reality it developed about hundred years after the travels of Kolumbus), and of hills, where the former castle, which stands current hotel El Castillo, are several board mountains to see, from those El Yunque the most well-known are.
Over coffee, which rum, which cigars, which Sierra Maestra mountains, which pig bay and the island Isla de Pinos, over whom Tropicana tropicana-Kabarett, which Heiligtum of of the Cuban Patronin Caridad del Cobre, over whom Santeria, an African religion, to which the descendants of slaves profess themselves, over all that one could many sides write.
But, as one says in such a way: Better with own eyes regard.
