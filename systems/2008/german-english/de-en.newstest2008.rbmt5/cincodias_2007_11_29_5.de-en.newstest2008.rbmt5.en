Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutes from on Mondays to on Fridays 12 hours on the day.
Popular decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
Altogether 200 of it is settled in the most economiceconomics regions of Spain.
For Institut, who operates under the label name Popular max, these addresses mean a large milestone.
In addition, for the remaining Spanish institutes, since Popular represents as a first bankers' syndicate the jump dares to extend and Saturday of 10h to 20.30h set the opening times of its branches of weekday to 20.30h.
The bankers' syndicate BBVA, which is likewise reported the extension of their opening times in the addresses repeated reads, seized so far still no definite resolution.
The to time current negotiations of the bank with the trade unions seem an agreement to aim at, with which 75% of all branches of Saturday are closed and but at a weekday to open in the afternoon, if also not for customers.
Whether further banks of the new initiative follow will depend, which adapts to the business opening times, on the empirical values of the Popular bank.
And straight that is also the intention, which pursues Popular with its project.
A goal is it to extend the opening times of those branches those due to its layer purchase-merry customers of independent, small and centralconstant enterprises, in addition, those of large department stores to seize can.
The bank would like to open the new 200 branches in the course of the coming 18 months, there it around new, but changed opening times does not act.
But the bank will transform the premises of those addresses, which already are in business zones, and them at the same time the individual customer profile of the different zones to adapt.
Thus the extension of the opening times is connected with a new spatial arrangement of the branches, which is characterised by a more current, farbenfroheres Design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera insures the fact that the restructuring does not require larger investments, but with a increased personnel attitude, there a branch would accompany now no longer six, but eight or nine employees needed.
The addresses, which will be equipped even with the additional premises for the KMU, will sell no financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the empirical values failed positively, so Ángel Rivero.
The addresses of the roads Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and the Gran Vía were selected for it which an intelligent resolution seems to have been.
Popular leads momentarily approx.. 2500 addresses.
And further 60, which operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and exhibit likewise extended opening times, even at sunning and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax the model of the BBVA is not used, since most of them instead for the sales will offer a broad selection of non--financial services.
"we would like to represent no competition for our customers", explain Rivero.
With Telefonica they came provisionally to the agreement to sell assistance of external bank personnel of mobile telephones.
