Nicaraguan court confirms twenty-year-old detention for Expraesidenten
An industrial tribunal in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year-old detention for the former president Arnold Alemán on Thursday, to which it had been condemned 2003 because of finance fraud at a value of 100 million dollar (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
However it was later from the prison dismisses and lived under house arrest on its Hazienda with the nicaruanischen metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes again behind lattices, is at present unclear according to the press agency AP.
The chairmen of the industrial tribunal, Ileana Pérez, according to it will depend now on the detention officials whether one lets Alemán its punishment serve at home, or whether it must in the prison.
A court proved before four years that Alemán had shifted regularly money of the government on accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts belonged in reality to its related and closest trailers.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund, which Alemán had furnished for the financing of its election campaign 2001.
