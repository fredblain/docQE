The climate on the Venus could show a view on the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to the life, said scientists yesterday.
Data of a European spaceship present at an orbit show the fact that the planet resembles a turned away twin of the earth still more than so far was conscious.
The Venus is the naeheste planetary neighbour of the earth.
The two worlds possess approximately the same size and have similar planet courses, however the Venus of the sun is somewhat closer.
Before billions of years on the Venus conditions would have prevailed, which would have been very similar to those on earth and even habitably, believed scientist could have been today.
But because of the carbon dioxide greenhouse effect without brakes, the erosion of the atmosphere by sun exposure and a slower rotation speed the Venus hit completely different development course.
Today the planet of water is robbed and has a surface temperature, which is hot enough, lead to melt and by hurricane-strong hoists and lightning towers is devastated.
The realizations of the space probe Venus express of the European space travel agency, which planned for one year examined, offer a ernuechternden view of how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climatic changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the department of physics at the University of Oxford, one the director/conductor of the Venus express mission, said: "it becomes clear, why the climate on the Venus to that earth is so different, while the planets are rather similar otherwise."
"our new data make it possible to design a scenario in which the Venus before billions of years began like the earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
