But its report pointed out that other important controls were correctly accomplished with a sample by five health authorities.

In addition passport -, work permit - belongs, and to qualification controls.
the Scottish government examines at present its politics and guidelines for controls before beginning of employment for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The secretary for health Nicola Sturgeon said: "it was me a request this work to implement in view of the terrorist attack on the airport Glasgow."
