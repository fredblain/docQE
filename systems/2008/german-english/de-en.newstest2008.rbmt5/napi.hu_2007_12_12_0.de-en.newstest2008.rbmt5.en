Food debt at European inflation
Principal reason for the rise of the inflation measured in the euro zone are the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro zone the price increase was higher in November than expected - after the 2,6 per cent in October an annual inflation rate was registered by 3.1 per cent, how the statistic office of the European Union in Luxembourg reports.
Official prognoses proceeded from only 3 per cent, announced Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British, and Canadian issuing bank the European central bank (EZB) did not lower the Leitzsins. After their discretion the rising rohstoffpreise and the easy decrease of unemployment the emergence of an inflationary spiral would favour the reduction of the rate of interest.
The EZB is anxious, the inflation rate under two per cent to keep at least scarce or at the two-per cent mark.
According to an analyst be the EZB in the dilemma: One must "agree upon" the inflation, in order to exclude later action need.
With 3,3 per cent the inflation rate reached a twelve-yearly record high in November in Germany; in Spain climbed the rate of 3,6 to 4,1 per cent.
For the rise of the inflation in the euro zone the risen food and energy price are responsible.
The MATIF Weizennotierungen rose by 88 per cent, and the course for soy beans reached likewise a record high since 1973.
Also with food oil and milk products there was a substantial price increase in 2007.
The world price for crude oil rose in this year by 52 per cent - in the past month the cost per barrel of the black gold reached almost 100 US dollar.
According to the EZB the inflation will rise in the year 2008 of 2,1 to 2,5 per cent, however one counts 2009 on a decrease on 1,9 per cent.
For the coming 3-4 months analysts proceed from a 3-Prozent-Inflationsrate, number the annual average rate however with 2,1 per cent.
For 2008 experts count on the fact that the EZB will twice lower the interest.
