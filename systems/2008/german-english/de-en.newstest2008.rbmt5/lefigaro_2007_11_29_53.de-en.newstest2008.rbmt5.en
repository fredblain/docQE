Spectacular repair at the space station
And its comrades of the crew of the international space station (EAT) more than seven hours in space will have used astronaut Scott Parazynski, in order to accomplish the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific work on the station.
_ a dare door, which due to its duration, which distance of habitable module, which speed, with which he organize, and which of the astronaut "tinker" tools, in order the repair accomplish, several record obtain have.
The problem arose on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindric part, which was to take up soon the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind jetty for the module laboratories.
But one must be able to supply it with river.
The second task of the crew was it thus to convert 17.5 tons a heavy module for generation of current over solar collectors, which already on EAT YOURSELF found, in order to bring it into its final position.
After it had shifted it, the crew made itself to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module, whose span amounts to 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be unfolded like Akkordeone was damaged by a gotten jammed cable on a length by approximately a meter
The restructuring was stopped, in order not to damage the collector still more.
The astronauts, who should repair the space shuttle Discovery originally for a kontrollgang abandoned and then another solar collector, whose rotation system was incorrect, saw themselves forced to dedicate itself to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk at the end of the 30 meters long remote controlled arm of the space shuttle, which at that the station one had attached, around in order the repair to accomplish.
It is one the best "Spacewalker" (Wetraumgaenger) of NASA.
Largely, resistantly, very skillfully, he has a well developed torso and long arms.
The 46-jaehirige learned physician was thus selected, whom "hurt" solar collector "operate".
After it had examined the damage exactly, it split the incorrect cable and fastened a kind rails on the damaged place.
It was supported by a second "Spacewalker", which remained in the proximity of the air-lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, Kommandantin of the crew.
The tool, which it used, a mini hockey stick, with insulator tapes, in order to prevent on the solar collectors, which produce several hundred V, an electrical impact, had the astronauts on board the station devised and "tinkered".
When the action was terminated, Scott Parazynski waited, until the collector was completely unfolded, before it counted and into the station back turned its tools.
Yesterday the astronauts enjoyed afternoon a half day relaxation, before today seven astronauts turned Discovery on the space shuttle back, in order to presumably begin Wednesday the return flight to the earth.
