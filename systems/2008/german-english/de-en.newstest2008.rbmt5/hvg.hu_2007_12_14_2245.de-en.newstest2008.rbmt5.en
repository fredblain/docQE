Six deterring little things, in order to annoy teammates
Enamel, which we forget to send, to language messages, which we never receive - harmless lies, which are not noticeable to us any longer: They bring "color" into the everyday life on the job.
The question is bare, whether one gets accustomed to these small incommodities, or places themselves one better to the challenge and tries these misleading to vermweiden for other annoying situations consciously.
Tipps.
"Sorry, I has forgets you to align that someone from the marketing department called" - a colleague says.
That one missed thereby a meeting?
One regrets it at best and tries it again to good-close perhaps, by calling at the marketing department and confessing reumuetig, one would have forgotten to align the message (that is the less usual method).
The thing with an apology is dismissed mostly.
Before one involves oneself into embarrassing excuses, one should consider, with which one can to prepare and try its colleague indeed unpleasant moments to avoid these situations consciously.
Something lent, which does not belong to one?
There are hardly something Nervigeres, as if one after a document, office supply, or the telephone seizes, not there but it is.
Yesterday did the booklet equipment still lie on the desk - this morning is it away?
Or lost believed ball-point pens for instance on the desk of a colleague discovered?
Without to ask one should not itself anything of the colleagues check-out counters, because they are by right annoyed, if they state that somewhat got away.
Thus, no covers or post office its from the office into the bag put, because it could meet one: keins more there, if man's nevertheless urgently needs.
GET ratchet over the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a gossip, which was already set into the world.
Who with whom, which made?
Where and why?
One should not bind the information (or assumptions) over the private life of the colleagues after possibility for everyone to the nose!
And if someone opens and tells us its internal secret nevertheless, we should not abuse this confidence!
Best one is silent like a grave, instead of aligning straight the not present one, even if others know about the problems of the colleague also.
Without reason ill announced?
If one calls in the office, in order to announce itself with reference to tormenting headache ill, because one feels straight uneasy, or to simply only rest itself, should one would like to realize oneself over one: Now the colleagues must settle the own work, urgent completions, projects with firm dates instead of one.
The colleague thus badly do not along-play!
If one already knows at the vortag that one will not create it on the next day in the office, or that somewhat interfere could, why one must remain at home, should one it in time announce, so that neither the colleagues, still the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Gesumme, Gekicher, telephoning
One is deepened straight in its work, by the loud Gekicher of the colleagues is however suddenly disturbed?
Inadvertently a telephone call belongs, which one should not have heard better?
One should not the colleagues with sums, singing, loud discussions (which one leads across its heads away), Getrampel, continuing grumbling or Noergeln nerves.
All this can be disturbing much, even if they are not deepened straight in a task (write, plan, organize).
Is the other debt always?
If a project is finished not within the prescribed period, one has an important letter or important realigns forgotten to send, should not look for one the debt of the own forgetfulness not with others!
After possibility one should not dissuade oneself from on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
Best one confesses oneself its to error, and apologizes, if others were affected also by it!
The question, how one good-makes the error again, or which missed retrieve can, is only too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training trousers and Schlapfen: Comfortably for at home, however in the office nothing lost!
Not even then one should dress so casual, if it would actually permit the job!
Only not too schlampig will - one should respect oneself both its colleagues, and so far that one dresses accordingly in the office - if desired, also prettily and elegantly!
