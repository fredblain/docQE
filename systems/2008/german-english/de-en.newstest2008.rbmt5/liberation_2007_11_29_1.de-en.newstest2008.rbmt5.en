Because she gave a name to a teddybaeren was demonstrated, it today a court in Khartum.
According to indication of her lawyer the British teacher, who had been accused in the Sudan of offense of the Islam, was condemned on Thursday evening by a court in Khartum to 15 days detention and following classification.
The Britin was accused of six to seven-year-old pupils to have permitted to give to a teddybaeren the name Mahomet although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would have earned it to be expenditure-whipped.
After parents of pupils had weighted several times at the Sudanese ministry for education and cultural, the 54-jaehrige basic lady teacher, who was active to the Unity High School of Khartum, was at home taken up on Sunday with itself and accused of according to the article 125 of the Sudanese penal code of the offense of the Islam.
This affair actually takes its beginning in September, when the teacher requests her six to seven-year-old pupil to select a name for the class teddy.
"the children suggest to Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed" eight names, among them, report head master Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class co-ordinates, 20 from 23 children Mohammed select as dearest first names.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a first name very frequent in the Sudan.
Subsequently, the children provided a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and to the caption "my name are Mohammed".
The bear did not carry a sign with this name, but the problem is completely simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as offense of the Islam.
One of the moslemischen colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, which informs at the same school in the Sudan, explained, he knew her well, and she would have never something would have done, with which she could step too close to a religious faith, "I regrets that she asked the children, for a name to only be correct", its judgement concerns it here only a "innocent error".
An opinion, which numerous pupils of the teacher divide, the this as "very attentively opposite their pupils" and as a "person, who never speaks in the class about religion" describes.
One considers that the first name Mohammed is simultaneous also the secondary name given in Great Britain at the secondly most frequent, for which in English 14 different ways of writing exists.
This of moslemischen families selected first name is often considered as a kind Ehrerbietung at the prophets (it is given frequently to the Erstgeborenen of a family).
But how the rules in the reference to the use of this first name read?
May one give it for example to a toy?
This is naturally a question of the interpretation.
