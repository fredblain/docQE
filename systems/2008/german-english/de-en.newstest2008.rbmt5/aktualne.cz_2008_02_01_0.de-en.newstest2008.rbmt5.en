Fraudulent broker risked billions because of inferiority feelings
Soil-loose cheat
Thus Jerome Kerviel the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer?ní designates its former employee banka.
She came because of him around nearly five billion euro.
It seems however rather in such a way that Kerviel was only a large player, who wanted to do it equal its colleagues beyond that surely not was unable.
To the difference to all large banking houses it recognized in time the crisis by amerikanischenn the mortgage market.
"it is psychologically rather weak," was from the mouth of its superiors to be heard, who indicated it at the police.
Like however from the statements Kerviels, which published the French media, for example the daily paper Le of moons, was it comes out humans, the end of last yearly with its business of profits at a value of 1.6 billion euro had obtained.
Crisis not only in America
"everything that I wanted, was to be earned for my bank money," states it in its statement.
In the summer he had succeeded in earning straight at the American crisis a half billion euro.
The opportunity in addition it had already erspaeht at the yearly beginning.
In February gave it already first messages over that so-called Sub Prime sub-Prime-Hypotheken, how they are given income-weak customers or such, who had already in former times payment by instalments problems, in difficulties were guessed.
Influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis however.
Kerviel believed that not and kept right.
At the year end it had raised its profit up to 1.6 billion euro.
"as I had already earned the first half billion, did not know I not, as I that to be explained should," admit Kerviel and continue to say that he had kept definitely nothing for itself.
During the whole verhoers it admits that it falsified documents, so that one would not come it on the schliche.
It succeeded to it even to lead its bosses behind the light even if gradually the Eurex stock exchange were interested in its business.
Risk profit
Did he fear to fly up?
Probably hardly.
"I thought that she satisfies the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
From where did it take the courage to risk so much?
He had to gain its position gradually.
The Société Générale it occurred in the year 2000, after it had directly terminated its study at the University of Lyon.
Its annual salary amounted to about 51000 dollar.
After two years he was an assistant of a broker and in the year 2005 already became he an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollar.
He knew nevertheless that he will earn never as much as others.
"with my first discussion in the year 2005 I already knew that one observed me.
Because of my training and also because of my vocational and personal development, "Kerviel explained the investigation official.
But already soon after its entrance first large success came.
With the shares of the alliance he earned much, by setting a half billion euro with the Londoner bomb attacks on kursverluste of this title.
And that was the trip - now he wanted more.
Solang you profit makes, leaves we you
"that is like a schneeball," said it the policemen.
But the bosses knew allegedly from everything, and/or suspected it.
"I money earned, closed one the eyes so long."
But then this yearly the large impact came at the beginning.
On only one day it lost a billion euro.
On one weekend in the middle of January wanted it to adjust.
When he came on Monday to the work, already was he no more employees of the bank.
And a few days the bank announced later that it had lost because of him five billion euro.
And how did they come it on the schliche?
It made itself suspicious by one vacation.
"I took only four days from the previous year.
A broker, who does not take vacation, is one, which does not want that one looks him into the maps, "said Kerviel finally.
