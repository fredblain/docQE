The Spanish private station Telecinco doubles for the first time its stock exchange value and overhauls thus its rival Antena 3.
"we created it."
With this sentence the managing director of Telecinco, with stock exchange conclusion gave his satisfaction to Paolo Vasile kund. The transmitter led by it had increased its value by double its rival the Antena 3.
An aspect however absorbed its joy: "that is exactly which me is hurt; not that we a higher growth, but that we had smaller losses ", determined it.
It stressed that they did not sink despite the weak market "too deeply."
Telecinco terminated yesterday the day with a plus of 2,54%.
This profit reduces its past losses of this year on 15,66%.
According to data of Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4,488.88 million euro now, whereby Mediaset controls the principal part of the capital (52 %), and Vocento only with 13% is involved.
The rival Antena 3 lost yesterday 1.52 per cent points and has since January a loss of altogether 40.5% to announce, so that its market value with 2,193.46 million amounts to half.
The market value of other quoted communication enterprises however rises; in the case of Sogecable on 3,571 million, with Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) on 2,518.53 million and with Vocento on 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it concerns "two similar enterprises", so Vasile.
Still the question, in which we can act to extent actually stock exchange-technically, appears uncertain to which price and as we it on customer level to be arranged lucrative can.
Telecinco explained one week ago its project to ascend this year to the first television station with more than 1000 million gross profits from incomes from advertising. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising enterprise of the group.
If the project should be converted, the transmitter would increase its advertising income compared with the 965.4 million from the previous year by 3,6%.
In the case of Antena 3 the net turnover rose around 1,6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while the net income from the television business could exhibit only a rise of 0,7% (630.4 million).
The analysts see the main factor for the stock exchange process of Telecinco, better in the comparison, with the high Payout Ratio, which the company could exhibit up to the current time: 2006 arranged the enterprise a 100 percent declaration of dividend led by Alejandro Echevarría.
Vasile insures however that the Ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of the portions of end mol, with Mediaset as parent company, nor, even if it is still too early for an official publication.
"we are committed to the official compromise to disburse at least 50% of the portions even if we indicated so far always substantially more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stocks we could already increase by the purchase of 33% of the end mol portions.
According to statement of the analysts the market to time exhibits certain loss tendencies.
Lehmann Brothers reduced only recently its profit calculation with Telecinco for this year by 4% and for 2009 by 7%.
This is the result of shortening the prospective growth rate, which will decrease/go back 2008 of 10,5% to 8,4% and 2009 of 5,5% to 5,1%.
This lowered also the prospective calculation of profits of Antena 3 for 2008 around 4,5% and for 2009 around 7,5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: sets on his high effective return and his lasting potential and recommends therefore the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buy) attaches due to the "multiple incentives" and the prosperierenden market a more favourable position than Antena to 3 (hold).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to put expectations back in both cases in view of the "similar threats" (satisfied market and worse restaurant climate)
