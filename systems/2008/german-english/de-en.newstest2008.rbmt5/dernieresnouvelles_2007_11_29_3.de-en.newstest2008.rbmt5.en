A heavy memory
After they were confidentially treated more than 60 years, Nazi archives of bath Arolsen, which documents the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of archives, which are accommodated on an overall length by 27 km in bath Arolsen, could not be seen up to now, it was with a "humanitarian" intention, thus individual and named, thus on inquiry of a former victim or its member.
The eleven with their administration assigned state under it Germany, France, Israel and the USA in May 2006 agreed to make it accessible for researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this resolution was locked, the opening is valid since yesterday.
Delicate information
The entrance of the historians to bath Arolsen it to make possible to operate investigations "particularly about the Deportationen of prisoners, the passengers of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced laborers", explains Reto masters, directors/conductors of these archives, which are administered by the international committee of the red cross (CICR).
Until recently still several states, also Germany were to make these named-referred documents for the public accessible due to the delicate character of certain information.
As for example the alleged Homosexualitaet or the mental handicap of some Deportationsopfer.
The passenger lists of the concentration camps or of the Gestapo of issued warrants of arrest had been gathered after the war for a practical reason: To civilians to possibly supply with, who deportiert or which hard labour had been subordinated to find and them an evidence of their arrest, in order to smooth for them so the way to their remuneration.
Still today Arolsen work on more than 300 established ones of ten thousands of personal inquiries in bath.
Nevertheless, a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in the entrance to bath Arolsen.
"one may not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents", Pr. Wolfgang Benz, director/conductor of the research center for Antisemitismus of the technical University of Berlin, 2006 had explained.
