<seg id="6"> The ECB is anxious, the inflation rate under two percent, or at least just at the. To hold</seg>
<seg id="7"> The ECB is according to an analyst in the dilemma: one must "arrange" the inflation in order to exclude later action need.</seg>
<seg id="8"> With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached in November in Germany; a twelve in Spain, the rate of 3.6 to 4.1 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Responsible for the rise of the inflation in the euro zone the increased food and energy prices.</seg>

<seg id="4"> In the budaörser has the price of the usual Christmas of the "napi" also this year by 16 percent, though has increased in all were price increases of over 1,000 hooves. Registered</seg>
<seg id="5"> After the prices in the food markets in last December, "have", the price increase hasn't turned out drastic, compared with the anyway high, earlier level.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, it has an effect on the consumers certainly deterring that that, for which they last year still far under 9.000 had paid this year not even available for 10,000. Is</seg>
<seg id="7"> The price of the "napi" shopping basket crossed the by at least 91 hoof in the investigated markets.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The highest price amounted to 10,573 hoof.</seg>
<seg id="9"> (in 6800 the price was at 6800.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The prices for unicum and live fish almost remained on previous year level, have increased strongly, on the other hand the prices for nut and poppy.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, with auchan gave it, however, for 139 forint.</seg>
<seg id="12"> There was no at the product on limited price slump with under 200 forint.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Here was surprising the price two litres of a Coca-Cola returnable bottle of under 200 forint, therefore the drink cost inclusive pledge only 257.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless performed this year in the "napi" cut at the most expensive, and cora at came off.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Our calculations showed that the prices in the "napi" shopping basket opposite the Christmas in the past year about 15, while Tesco and auchan respectively increased about 18 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the this year amounted to 12%, while the rise between the shopping basket of the past year and of the current year constituted 21%.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The average price rise amounted to 1,480.00 hoof.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The average price increase still was in the previous year at forint, however, the added value tax increase at the prices to last Christmas. Manifested</seg>
<seg id="19"> Exactly this process has affected the trade terribly: apparently the department stores could not decide so right which price margin they shall use at the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on the consumption were unforeseeable.</seg>
<seg id="20"> (if the vendor the circulation speed of a product badly plans, he can fall about essential profits in the price margin, according to the traffic intensity.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The price increase of the "napi" turned out in the last year so radically that the most expensive basket the value of 2006 around 1720 exceeded, whereas the price difference was merely 844 forint at the cheapest basket. Amounted to</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Such extremes were not observed this year, since the most expensive basket cost around 1,630.00 forint more than in the previous year, and even with the cheapest, there was a rise in prices of forint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In the comparison of the two last Christmas showed itself a disastrous price increase, the price of the daily consumer items in the hypermarkets in less than 20 months around more than 30 percent. Increased</seg>
<seg id="24"> (This in turn confirms not necessarily the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: with some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months, a more than a price increase.</seg>
<seg id="25"> So in about next to flour also with eggs.)</seg>
<seg id="26"> If one takes, however, a look into the "napi" shopping basket, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the already in the previous year the product even in the worst case around hardly more than 10 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Obviously there are flour suppliers in a stronger position than the egg -- after all, they could the drastic increase in prices on the multinationals. Pass</seg>

<p>
<seg id="28"> In the golden complain the hypermarkets do not; it is reported constantly of good years.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not look at the prices more.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It from all large quantities are bought, durable food go into pallets over the counters.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Wednesday morning there were in all three department stores endless queues with the cash, as the number of the customers suddenly exploded.</seg>
<seg id="32"> However by the country a smaller customer frequency is reported, so that many multinationals complain with the pollsters, they could not achieve even the planned turnover, and indeed not only in the case of food, but also with lasting materials.</seg>

<seg id="1"> In many places at disinfectants</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This year more than one thousand infections in hospitals were registered, the due to inappropriate handling antibiotics. Were</seg>
<seg id="3"> The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overflow of the beds, the overload of the personnel -- all factors, the the embankment of the infections not good at all, so are the leading doctor of the national epidemiology Center.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In many places also with the disinfectants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the traumatology-department of the to hospital recently an mrsa infection was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient, after a serious accident to the hospital. One was</seg>
<seg id="7"> The patient was isolated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The injured person of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, a little later had the man, however, with a mrsa infection to return. An important operation could since then because of the bacterium which still is in the body of the patient, not yet to be carried out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Until December 10th this year were from hospitals activated by virus infections initiated at the national nosocomialis surveillance system, so the leading doctor of the national epidemiology Center,. Karolina</seg>
<seg id="11"> So many infections released by multi-resistant exciters were thus registered in the hospitals with security, but the true figure might be higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were by the mrsa, the staphylococcus aureus resistant staphylococcus aureus. Triggered</seg>
<seg id="13"> The staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium contributes about a third of the people in their nose, without that it would cause an illness.</seg>
<seg id="14"> SA limited infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) usually react well to antibiotics, they are well curable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The means are however measured out too high or used inappropriately, arise from the well respondierenden bacteria antibiotics resistant, the under appropriate conditions in the hospitals. Spreads fast</seg>
<seg id="16"> In particular with patients with weakened, or durably badly functioning immune systems, but also in older, or patients with a low body weight these bacteria can cause heavy infections, such as infection or blood poisoning, thus sepsis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The medical director of the to hospital, according to the mrsa infection is nothing special, such occurrences. Belongs to the</seg>
<seg id="18"> One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, tibor nyulasi - there is not only there, where it is not searched.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Resistant to antibiotics</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "such patients are isolated, the nursing staff carry rubber gloves and masks with the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - so.</seg>
<seg id="21"> With their admission into the hospital will the patients examined, nevertheless an infection can always be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Sampling too rare</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The majority of the infections in hospitals triggered by mrsa would be avoidable, however the currently reigning conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the containment of the origin or the spreading of the virus, says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> After this infection mainly occurs in hospitals and homes for the elderly, the taken patients should investigate and mrsa immediately isolate.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not practised, however, so frequently.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Last but not least because it on the part of the national health insurance company no subsidies for this investigation.</seg>
<seg id="27"> The most cases would come to light before then, if the patient has already a noticeable has, so the medical head of the epidemiology Center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there are, however, also in Hungary to guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be, this means microbiological examinations are necessary, so that no resistance can form against the means, however this directive of hospitals are also not always kept.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Under the ambulatory, or in the basic supply the patient microbiological sampling are even still rarer, so. Karolina</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> One saves with the disinfectants</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Scientific evidence proves that mrsa from a patient on the other the most frequently by the nursing staff will transfer.</seg>
<seg id="33"> Just therefore the manual washing, or the carrying of gloves and masks are of a great importance, however, there are also on this area considerable shortcomings in the hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Mrsa is transmitted through droplet infection or contact in the local hospitals, however, There isn't always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds connected barely although it between them from the epidemiological view, a distance of at least 1.5 meters. That should give</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Like karolina keeps on saying, it happens unfortunately in the financially less well placed hospitals even that with disinfectants is saved, it gives few nurses, many patients - all factors, which almost favour the emergence of infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there and / or the further distribution of the virus can be stopped where these protective measures are adhered to, so. Karolina</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Government program against mrsa</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> In the mrsa grip to get the causes Health insurances enormous costs, therefore they are fought everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="40"> In England for example, the prevention of mrsa, and / or their containment was held in the government program.</seg>
<seg id="41"> After first signs the program successfully -- as published data prove, the tendency of the declining in England.</seg>
<seg id="42"> The European Center for disease prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the emergence of viruses (under that also mrsa), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Political capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to the department for risk analysis (risk division) of political capital the activities in this August with support of the "movement for a better Hungary," Hungarian guard founded the risk of Hungary and the region in more respect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the "risk" of the Institute of it means among other things: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk represents the "aggravation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary, even at short notice could lead to violent ethnic discussions."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Main reason for that is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, which supposedly on the provocation of such a confrontation aims, according to the research institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> As reported, will this as a failure on the part of the politically responsible persons: looked at "persons of the public life have the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political grouping, which now their political strategy on the have built up".</seg>
<seg id="6"> One suspects that this intensify the problem, the rational dialogue impossible extremities favour, as well as the probability of violent quarrels would increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The forschungsinsitut means, the activities of the Hungarian guard would have, not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the local and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad substantially, in particular, what the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity." affects</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> We remember: since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary continuously in the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several, "national self-defense association" organizations were founded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "these groupings it is common that they each case define themselves as civilian organization, while they boast openly about their members on - sometimes armed - Defense tasks of preparing (disaster control, national Defense,), under appointment on the unsuitability of the police, the army, and / or the State itself,", it was said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> And further: that everything happens in accordance with that method, which tries, different, on the policies and of the population, based, political efforts as civil initiative. To disguise</seg>
<seg id="11"> The emphasis of the civilian character and the association therefore serve not only the evasion of legal hurdles, in the course of the registration with Court -- could emerge, it is at the same time a political strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Like to be inferred from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk factor also for the relations with the neighboring States.</seg>
<seg id="13"> "in the last months, the Hungarian guard was in several States as a potential source of danger, quoted so many a politician of certain neighboring countries sees in the emergence of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own. Anti</seg>
<seg id="14"> That everything has effects on the political stability of the region "- it was called.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> From the viewpoint of the research institute is the establishment of the Hungarian guard is not in, thus the political risk for the entire region grew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As reports, the activities of the Hungarian guard with those of comparable to the Bulgarian national guard, whose foundation in August 2007 of the Bulgarian's National Union (bnu). Was announced</seg>
<seg id="17"> In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian guard the stood the riotings in a district of Sofia (krasna poljana) have taken place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The bnu has the incidents equal to the cause for the establishment of the national guard, with the argument that the aim of the organization is the "national protection".</seg>
<seg id="19"> According to their opinion was indeed in the past 17 years a real "terror" marked in Bulgaria, the state however remained idle and indifferent - so political capital.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And further: the initiative would have an intense debate in the Bulgarian public. Kicked loose</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As said that the increased risk for ethnic discussions is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard to reasons.</seg>
<seg id="22"> There the activities of the Hungarian guard so far many similarities with those of the Bulgarian national guard shows it is not to be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma likewise, with the organization of their own protection to react to the threats it is called in the risk of political capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Attila juhász, Director of research with political capital said on request of the report: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Every year would be published annually and should is tendencies be recognizable, the public opinion is informed, as in the case by the publication of the risk.</seg>

<seg id="2"> In Hungary holidays are regulated legally exactly, so that the procedure for the reorganization of the work days around the holidays, in the meantime, though, has established the next year grants us less such days.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Also in the EU and in America one means something else under "holiday".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and days.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Work-free days are mostly church holidays, or stand with important historical events in connection.</seg>

<seg id="11"> Since our state, national or religious holidays rare on a weekend fall, the practice of the "shift" worked satisfactorily in the cases, in which we before or after the holiday only a day. Would work</seg>
<seg id="12"> The price of the extended weekends is, however, that we very probably work on Saturdays before it, or must go into the school.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Six as a deterrent, in order to annoy colleagues</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> E-mails which we forget to send, messages, which we never receive - harmless lies, the US don't notice any more: they bring "color" in the everyday life on the job.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The question is whether one becomes accustomed to these small used, or provides one better to the challenge and attempts this misleading, for other angry situations consciously.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Tips.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "sorry, I have forgotten to pass on to you that someone from the marketing department called" -- a colleague says.</seg>
<seg id="6"> That one has missed a meeting through?</seg>
<seg id="7"> At best one regrets it and tries it again when maybe one phones the marketing department and admitting, one would have forgotten to align the message (this is the less usual method).</seg>
<seg id="8"> Is usually the thing with an excuse. Dismissed</seg>
<seg id="9"> Before one involves oneself in embarrassing excuses, one should consider, with which one his colleagues can truly prepare unpleasant moments, and try to avoid these situations intentionally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Something lent, which does not belong to one?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> There is hardly something sinewy as if one after a document, or the telephone, but it is not there.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Yesterday the notebook device still lay on the desk - it is today? away</seg>
<seg id="13"> Or lost believed ball-point pens for instance on the desk of a colleague? discovered</seg>
<seg id="14"> Without one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow, because they are annoyed, if they determine that something got away.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Thus, no covers or mail from the office put into the bag, because it could meet: no more there, if one's nevertheless urgently needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Gossip about the private life of the colleagues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> There is no effective means, a gossip, which was already put into the world. To stop</seg>
<seg id="18"> Who with whom?, which made</seg>
<seg id="19"> Where and why?</seg>
<seg id="20"> The one should information (or assumptions) about the private life of the colleagues after possibility not every tie to the nose!</seg>
<seg id="21"> And if someone opens and his innermost secret betrays us, we should not abuse this confidence!</seg>
<seg id="22"> Best one is silent as a grave, instead of just not present to pass on, even if others about the problems of the colleague also know.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Without reason ill? reported</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If one calls in the office, under reference to tormenting headache to ill, report because one just feels uneasy, or simply would only like to rest, one should himself about one: to realize the own work, urgent, projects with firm dates must now the colleagues instead of one themselves.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore!</seg>
<seg id="26"> If one knows already on the day before that one it on the next day not into the office will manage, or that something could get in the way, why one must remain at home, one should announce it in time, so that neither the colleagues, still the leader unexpectedly confronted with the absence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Hum,, giggle, telephoning</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> One is hollow just in his work, however, is suddenly by the loud giggling of the colleagues? disturbed</seg>
<seg id="29"> Unintentional a telephone conversation overheard that one better should not have heard?</seg>
<seg id="30"> One should not the colleagues with sums, singing, loud discussions (the one leads over their heads), trample, continuing grumbling or nerves.</seg>
<seg id="31"> All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just in a task (write, plan, organize) recessed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Are always the other? blame</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Is a project is not ready in due time, one has an important letter or important realigns forget to send, one should not the fault of the own forgetfulness at other! search</seg>
<seg id="34"> As far as possible one should not on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!</seg>
<seg id="35"> Best one admits his errors, and apologizes, if others were affected also by it!</seg>
<seg id="36"> The question, how one the error again, or which missed retrieve can, is only too made!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In the office - a feeling like to home?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Pants and schlapfen: comfortably for at home, but lost nothing in the office!</seg>
<seg id="39"> Not even then one should dress so casual, if it would actually permit the job!</seg>
<seg id="40"> Only not to become too - one should both his colleagues, as also themselves even as far as that respect one dresses accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!</seg>

<seg id="13"> The formation, which originally had appeared in smaller clubs, was known to the wider public first, as the magazine "wan2" their first album from the year 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums and zagar, together with, to the almost only, also in the West marketable trendsetter.</seg>
<seg id="14"> And his band undoubtedly were "trendy", however, no-one was interested in knowing whether they also like to bear this brand.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The band has reacted as it should: with a new, still better album.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The now appeared new album with the title "cannot walk walk fly" could open new paths for them, however the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the pécser years.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The expression originates namely from the time when Balázs with yet another band was on the way.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The airy, flying allusion would be also in order, to fall, however, apart from the ethereal character of the music - the spirit of the time and the trends -- corresponding to louder guitar, the influences of the rock 'n' roll on.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24"> Balázs: the term "layer music" does not mean me straight much.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In my opinion, there are two boxes in the pop music, and indeed not mainstream and underground or alternative and pop, but commercial and honestly.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Even the so-called alternative or underground can be shallow and meaningless, exactly the same, they can also, however, only for the sale be produced, which makes it commercial music.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Also a good can arise from an honest motive.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The acceptance of the listener functions independently according to this principle, independently of languages and borders.</seg>

<seg id="30"> B. zs.: abroad, particularly to the west of us the pop music has a greater tradition.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="33"> Hvg.hu: what role comes to the audience at your work?</seg>

<seg id="35"> B. zs. Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.</seg>
<seg id="36"> However, we have never for the market.</seg>
<seg id="37"> With us the music does not develop, in order to serve a purpose, but from a certain reason.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The role of the public is usually marked with the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but it gives again only in the unreachable changes of the moment.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="42"> B. zs. We don't really go his way, once completely disregarded the fact that one attempts again and again, this in our music.</seg>
<seg id="43"> We see rather than which on the musical presence of the other one trust and they unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="44"> Originally were naturally comparisons of our work with the of to inevitable, since several of us come from his band and have taken another way.</seg>

<seg id="47"> Was the opening with a somewhat style in the direction of a wider audience? conscious</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> B. zs.: we had no plans to write a hit, the then as a train horse for the album. Is supposed to serve</seg>
<seg id="49"> In this song, it is a matter of more.</seg>
<seg id="50"> It was meant as final of the album, with which we, the and the somewhat more difficult topics. Wanted to dissolve</seg>

<seg id="52"> Why just it, which was the guidance principle?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> B. zs.: the basic idea was to do a gospel-like choir.</seg>
<seg id="54"> Then the idea came to combine the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.</seg>
<seg id="55"> So the six-headed choir arose - thus for sena, edina bori, judie jay, bori péterfy, [neo], sena, -, we then baptized that "underground stars". Have christened</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> B. zs.: there was the number already in the longer version, but as the material was ready for the album, we imagined that this number still "needs something."</seg>
<seg id="58"> The chord has really asked for a singing voice.</seg>
<seg id="59"> I still have one sung the in the same night, she has learned the girls later.</seg>
<seg id="60"> It everything came virtually immediately and alarming spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="61"> I can remember, I was then quite electrified, but it also has already needed the "stars".</seg>
<seg id="62"> With my voice alone the song would never become so strong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Hvg.hu: both on the plate, as also at the concert, however, one had the impression, the girls would be in the background.</seg>
<seg id="64"> It gives no solo part (except for the short solo from jay), they have no own role, sings perfectly together and are not louder than the music, therefore their gesang't only accompanied by the music.</seg>
<seg id="65"> Also on the stage they stood behind.</seg>
<seg id="66"> ? is it intention</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67"> B.zs.: that they are stood at the rear was so because of purely technical problems.</seg>
<seg id="68"> However we wanted them aware no solo roles.</seg>
<seg id="69"> In the number it also is all about that one to forget his ego a little bit should forget, who from where come and where is away, we simply allow us too, that these certain wings, the wings of the love.</seg>
<seg id="70"> I would like that others also feel this euphoric condition, which we have felt when the song has arisen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> Hvg.hu: which one was the most? song</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> B. zs.: with the musical work work actually none, it gave more difficult tasks rather when mixing.</seg>
<seg id="73"> For example in the case of "dorian Gray's dilemma", in which I play on a, or in the case of "rock 'n' roll goes to the girls", where the groove did not want to function longer, but after and little everything turned out, as in the case of a puzzle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> Hvg.hu: which is your favourite number of the new album?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75"> B. zs.: that changes continuously with the concerts and also now where I have the album "losgelasssen".</seg>
<seg id="76"> Currently there are "prophet is a fool", "escape from the earth" and the number "seed".</seg>

<seg id="1"> Budget is through</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, it is created.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The national budget is approved.</seg>
<seg id="4"> What is special one at this budget?</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is the first budget which this government has designed and without the support of the opposition by the coalition was accepted.</seg>
<seg id="6"> For the current year was still with support of the cssd (social democrats), approved because it Minister sobotka (of this party) had submitted, and the cssd could not allow it therefore rejecting him.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence against the government nothing dramatic happened this time.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Parliament approved this traditionally few paid attention to, nevertheless highly important law in all peace.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This is to a certain extent paradoxical.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Rules over everything begins and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the budget, whether one likes this or not.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The budget is an essential component of the politics, however, is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="12"> That is for the media a more grateful topic, and therefore they devote more attention to him.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A controversy among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober numbers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The national budgets suffered at the past social democratic governments under three weak points, which the budget for the year 2008 not on once: can eliminate</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The first is the high share of expenditure because of law obliging, at which it is not only about the pensions, but also about social expenditures, which the "silent" coalition of cssd and ksm (Communists) in the last year before the elections has concluded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The second is the account budget policy as a result of the first.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the local authorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id="19"> This budget is public and one javelin measures under control.</seg>
<seg id="20"> However, a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Many mayors spent, about except incomes from taxes, taxes and bank credits further sources for investments, often mostly from bonds, by which they caused their city halls in the excess.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In the last years, they succeeded, these debts by massive sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks, the them in the train had received from the State to pay off.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Now is this source already dried up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> As far as we ourselves only at official and verifiable facts, we notice that:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Our economy for some years, like the rest of the world, a growth through, whose the cssd incessantly himself boasts.</seg>
<seg id="26"> This represented a unique possibility for their governments to take public finances into order.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Instead these governments were to blame for the state, however, still more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt have much more reasonable than our Republic.</seg>
<seg id="29"> This is a giant disgrace which mainly be ascribed to the former governments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> We belong to the countries, which, in the global scale, seen at the least of poverty are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Therefore no nassiven social programs are necessary, which unfortunately just in the last few years quite in gigantic extent was blown up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Even if it is successful, a part of the unreasonable populist expenditures, which were adopted this year before the elections, to paint, is clear, that if it does not come in next time to a shift of the pension entry age and to a pension reform comes, then virtually any politics in this country, and, very now who is in power, he will not have anything as a pure administration.</seg>
<seg id="33"> It is only easily exaggerated, if one says that then from ruling politicians officials become, the largest part of the tax revenue mechanically up on pensions and social expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="34"> Therefore the this year's budget can not be a revolution, but can only to the displacement of normal expenditures by duty areas.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The deficit provided for 2008 of 70 billion Crowns would be quite superfluous if earlier governments in the last ten years would have not distributed, which only went.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If we don't want that it really comes to that from ruling politicians pure verwaltungsbeamte become, then we must be patient and this is not too strong coalition government, however, which is conscious that the state can spend only so much, as it is at taxes and fees to take in the situation is quiet at the preparation of further reform laws.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Only these make a gradual penetration of a balanced national budget.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Test Peugeot 207 sw: voruteile fades</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In order to say the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Its handling characteristics were not much value, the quality of the gear shift, the guidance and also the processing could one as rather designate below average.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Now but his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and this is about much better.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The combination with the designation sw is still a piece of further and only remains for me to revise my opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As I had tested the classical hatchback 207, I had to me, for example about the too small on the rear seats.</seg>
<seg id="7"> There are now no longer these complaints, because the body combination is formed in such a way that not even suffer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Quickly further</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> I go through only shortly, in order not to repeat me too much.</seg>
<seg id="10"> It is a quite excellent design, where I have only because of the miserable central tunnel's objections.</seg>
<seg id="11"> There I would welcome a little more designerische organization, where otherwise the car makes such an elegant impression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The seats are comfortable and are the times past, where perhaps we complained about to short seats or head restraints.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Also the side has fundamentally improved in comparison with the 206.</seg>
<seg id="14"> What the room supply concerns here as well, one can feel the increased dimensions of the body.</seg>
<seg id="15"> In the station wagon is also the already mentioned lack of, is eliminated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Suitcases in the trunk</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The main point at this car is, however, the cargo hold.</seg>
<seg id="18"> I must (also because of the reverse window) as very well beladbar and space-saving.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The cavities are equipped with safety belts, which represent an ideal compromise.</seg>
<seg id="20"> You do not disturb, make itself and hold even more difficult objects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But let's talk about the case volume.</seg>
<seg id="22"> It amounts to according to table in the basic equipment 428 litres, which in the comparison to the competition is a rather average value.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Though not in comparison to the vehicle of this class, the Skoda fabia combi.</seg>
<seg id="24"> If we the 207 sw with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, compares we determine that the Peugeot around clearly perceptible 52 liters.</seg>
<seg id="25"> For a foreign vacation or while inviting a pram this value is already critical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But in order to emphasize the positiva, I must still the loading space completely flat after turning the cargo hold or also the very low loading up edge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> 120 PS in four rows</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> With our test car was with a four-cylinder capacity of 1.6 litres and a performance of 88 KW. Equipped</seg>
<seg id="29"> And honestly said, so should have a look, which propels a family.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.</seg>
<seg id="31"> If I compare him with his counterpart at Skoda, which sometimes works, as would be its exhaust with a rag clogged, then I can only be inspired by him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The price list speaks volumes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The price of this car is not just national.</seg>
<seg id="34"> However, we must remember that we are a well equipped car with a spacious innneren and a very good engine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> The basic price of the car with the 1400s gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns still concerns.</seg>
<seg id="36"> With our engine it costs as 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.</seg>
<seg id="37"> The equipment quality of the test beats still once with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.</seg>
<seg id="38"> We had however bags, automatic air conditioning system, automatic windshield wiper electrical window lifters behind and and...</seg>
<seg id="39"> So the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.</seg>
<seg id="40"> That is a lot, but you calculate once the additional equipment fabia together and they will arrive with a very similar sum.</seg>
<seg id="41"> Therefore only remains the decision, which mark one wants to choose.</seg>

<seg id="22"> Another option is the extended insurance, the the customer against external damages, not however against the harm arisen at the own car.</seg>
<seg id="23"> In addition, this type of the insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Here. A Council</seg>
<seg id="25"> If you are under 25 years old, it lies in your hand to lower the cost of insurance; so your credit increases itself when trying to drive carefully and to avoid accidents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> A credit is a lowering of the base rate at the corresponding insurance company.</seg>
<seg id="27"> In the opposite for this purpose a payment a rise of said rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "the height of credits and punishing payments hang from the society and their returns.</seg>
<seg id="29"> If the enterprise has a rich year behind it, can permit itself to increase the bonus ", explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> As soon as the 25-year exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to sign a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving the accident rate sinks.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Thus, it is the most sensible for a full comprehensive insurance with. To decide</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> "normally the young people can not profit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident than also at the time of the driving not", describe the Spanish chiefs of the European enterprise, and adds that the majority of the accidents in the second occur, after the "fear of the beginner" was put down.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Nevertheless, it is the case of a married customer, doesn't have any children to effect a fully comprehensive insurance; naturally only then, if it the financial situation of the appropriate person. Also allows</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> On the part of the insurers, married couples with children as the customers with the lowest accident rate, and correspondingly low as well from its payments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> In this case would be a full comprehensive insurance with (at an amount by the 300 Euros) the best option. In the case that one received a high credit, has recommended an extended insurance, the first to the third shows commitment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> "they travel altogether more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power, which permits it to them, a higher payment of dues to set", determine Luis Noguera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> For pensioners it offers itself, with a full hull (at an amount by the 150 euros), or an extended insurance, to conclude, the only at a sufficiently high credit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Finally one must observe that the car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damages, but also because they high costs, which require it, that a thorough selection is met, which corresponds to our personal situation.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to Gazprom, more must be charged to the Ukraine, since the company agreed up to 50% for natural gas from the neighboring Turkmenistan to pay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Analysts say that this could mean that the Ukraine 40% more for the imports of Gazprom. Must pay</seg>

<seg id="1"> Pain of the Labour Party</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Gordon Brown still has a further pit for falling; its way from this remains the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.</seg>
<seg id="4"> No titles seem sold, Parisian pays no politician, no hotel bills toes. To have been</seg>
<seg id="5"> However the exposure, that a rich businessman donations for the British governing Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people masked, and that the party failed to announce this, is something without that contested Gordon Brown well would have managed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Than two months ago the Prime Minister the demand after a choice had escaped way the intelligence of the British insulting, by claiming that opinion polls would not have affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Instead, such as vince cable, the increasingly astute agency chairmen of the Liberal Democrats, it expressed, the once dreaded Brown has developed from Stalin to Mr. bean.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The awkward rescue of northern rock, a shattered bank, showed regulatory weakness and bad judgement under bombardment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Badly thought-out proposals for the change of the revenue laws have set enterprise associations against the government.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The loss of personal data of 25 million people showed inconceivable administrative bunglings.</seg>
<seg id="11"> A trio of generals in the retirement started a revolt in the House of Lords from protest against reductions of military expenditure: ministers of the armed forces to be, so they claimed, a partial time job is.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Now there are the various contributions of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, labours Secretary-General (and their former fulfillment) is already resigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Nothing of that means that brown direction breaks up withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it impossibly to rule.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Still being allowed to people trust in politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism if a new troop takes the office.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If it is clear once that it is improbable that a Prime Minister improves the situation and it does not even need long in this case to be, this delay is past: the public service begins to become leaky; the cabinet to start; the press looks for bad news; and the government is defensive and aimless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> On a way the position of brown is particularly difficult, because he in contrast to other political leaders can not say, to be a new broom.</seg>
<seg id="18"> So with pleasure he Tony Blair would deny, it was his. Lieutenant</seg>
<seg id="19"> The problems with northern rock and the, for example, hang together with decisions which brown made as a Chancellor of the Exchequer.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And even if the was not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes - as in the case of the "money for nobility" investigation of political party financing - go to the voters, possibly from this that he was it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In spite of that situation is not quite as bad as it looks</seg>
<seg id="22"> The offenses are not so terrible as the Conservatives describe it.</seg>
<seg id="23"> As in the case of Mr. bean, nobody died, or was entirely cheated.</seg>
<seg id="24"> And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to be delivered, which of course Stalinist tendencies always promised: a reliable, solid and easy brutal government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The new fuss about political donations is a good example.</seg>
<seg id="26"> The garboeske Abrahams, which compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, says he wants no public recognition for its goodwill.</seg>
<seg id="27"> This may be perhaps so, but the decision it wasn't entitled to it.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist from a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy entrance to those, which govern the country.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Watt, the says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will have to position itself some questions obviously; exactly as labours main finance recoverer the over the separate contributions in October. One told</seg>
<seg id="30"> But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing that indicates that he knew from these confusion, although the largest part of the payments made after his taking office in June. That was</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Up to now the Prime Minister finished half of the work.</seg>
<seg id="32"> He has fast the violation of the laws by his party, but sentenced he diluted this determination by reaching for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry to the topic - led, in order to make the measure full, of a bishop in the retirement and a judge.</seg>
<seg id="33"> In this case the "teachings to be pulled out of" not very complicated.</seg>
<seg id="34"> If the law was broken, it is a matter for the police.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Apart from that, there are other things to make the Mr. brown must, as something of a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in public life, to find the is vacant for six months, and to make progress with a drastic reform of political party financing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> That would require from the hardliners of the labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps the special financial relationship with the trade unions to abandoning - bitter pills for a party Member like Mr Brown.</seg>
<seg id="37"> But he should be conscious of some partial facts.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The Conservatives have now a clear leadership in the opinion polls; he has two years to win voters back; and the only way, as he can reach a victory is competence by incontestable honesty and solid.</seg>

<seg id="1"> England confronted with decision over the statements by owais Shah and</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Here two dilemmas, each of them almost just as difficult as the others.</seg>
<seg id="3"> As who should number 6 for England in kandy at this weekend, owais Shah or ravi bopara?</seg>
<seg id="4"> And, not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is supposed to make the decision?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second question is important, because David graveney, the, on call at least under this specific title, here is around the boss Peter moores and the captain Michael Vaughan to help to decide, and because the table of high morries, the English managing director, gradually with applications for national voter fills, if not even for what. In part-time</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Who does not even always get the sixth, will be unfortunate, but the life is often unfair and the sport is it beyond doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It is never simply to nail exactly what a human being made it possible the top of his profession to reach, while someone else over the lowest rank, sometimes from lack of luck instead of ability.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is not only necessary in the, where the choice is difficult, where judgements are necessary, which are subjective at the end always.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Is it the right time for bopara climb up?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Is it fair to Shah if he does it?</seg>
<seg id="11"> The same can perhaps also in a wider range, be asked whether for example John edwards or "tubby" banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good conclusions, which know the business well should be promoted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Who can say what the correct class for a cricketer, unless the possibility is given to him swimming or going down.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Numbers have of course a large influence on decisions, but chances also have this.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Within a team a cricketer must the eye of the captain to the right time catch, if he can take a wicket and a must get regular chances on the order, if he wants to do impression as a one-day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> To catch the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="16"> There were many, which in the last season better than, for example, as James Anderson were apparently in the first test, will play even if Stephen harmison declares itself as healthy and as the wind in the nets.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with each 33 runs in order to earn a position in this tour.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Chris tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope on still more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Whether Shah or bopara in the asgiriya stadium, plays a only can be.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it perhaps however makes little difference.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Four years ago in Sri Lanka played Gareth batty in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, it was, however, Paul collingwood, to consolidate then still fightingly around himself, the the breakthrough to an important testkricketspieler created and that, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, perhaps still underestimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Probably is that graveney, Vaughan and moorland, after a further discussion in the course of today's meeting in the asgiriya stage their conservative instincts and belly's greater experience over net enthusiasm will follow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> There are arguments for both.</seg>
<seg id="24"> For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of bopara, which is seven years younger with 22 years, and an excellent balance against balls.</seg>
<seg id="25"> But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in the may against West Indies in the test in Lord, his arena as a player from middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the selectors as Vaughan was healthy about his position for the next game to take back, seems the momentum from its striking to have taken the was obvious still in Bombay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In contrast the has Jack of all trades from Essex. Essex</seg>
<seg id="27"> He is of nothing on a impressed and its attitude off of it was taken to the point, as he recently with a vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen had estimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> He suffered from smaller injuries and presumably a shock, but the first, which he did, was his Vodafone (of course also gesponsort) out and his colleague Alastair Cook, which had observed this from the distance, and with enthusiasm to say: "have you seen this?".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Bopara is a much better player on the field, he bowls his central speed with some effect here on the grounds, which seems to fit him and hits with confidence and destiny.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The right man to select a thing, the right time to choose a different.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Perhaps this is the real art of the selection.</seg>
<seg id="32"> I slope in addition bopara now its chance to give, which does not mean that Shah not stand there perhaps nevertheless well, if, as the tea from Ceylon suggests, it is that, will play here this weekend.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Qassim Al atwani, a 38-year-old teacher from the overwhelming Sunni part of amariyah, returned with his two children, because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not permit to work Iraqis.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="16"> Salaam al-samarrai, a 51-year father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that nouri al-Maliki, the Prime Minister, had requested of the Syrian Government to impose visa restrictions for the fugitives, in order to compel people for the return.</seg>
<seg id="17"> More than two and a half million people are probably from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "to us it went well until Syria visited and the government pushed to the Iraqis no more visas to give, about them for the return in the Iraq to force", said the Sunni pensioners.</seg>
<seg id="19"> "I can not trust a government which supports the criminals, the House burned down after I went away."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A part of the reason for the drop of the power is that Sunnis from Shiite residential areas and vice versa were expelled, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have eased.</seg>
<seg id="21"> There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will stir sectarian tensions up again and it will come to conflicts.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He delivers a wonderfully winking representation: strictly speaking its war, the Simon hunt what from gere could have become, if the fate and the reporter were not so benevolent: a man, his very best times for a long time behind itself, but himself as a monument of his fall still preserved considerable residues of the former charm.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> With "murderous peace," one can make short process: the film is of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian topol, Max riemelt), the a serbin from SAVE, on which the one promptly also still in love with them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although it is welcome that here once not the Serbs as exclusive root of all evil are represented, the loses itself film too fast in geballer and action.</seg>

<seg id="20"> This is so bad that one of the International Court of Justice in The Hague because of crimes against the call would like to.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21"> The film has a deeply human request.</seg>
<seg id="22"> He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to agree for once) the following due to secret political arrangements too to operate intensively.</seg>
