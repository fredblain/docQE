<seg id="4"> Official prognoses came from only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In contrast to the American, British, and Canadian bank of issue, the European headquarters bank (EZB) did not sink the Leitzsins. According to your estimating the increasing raw material prices and the easy decline of unemployment would favor the interest decline the origin of an inflation spiral. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The EZB is endeavored to hold the inflation rate under two percent, or at least tightly at that two-percent-sign. </seg>
<seg id="7"> According to an analyst, the EZB is in the dilemma: One would must "arrange" the inflation in order to exclude later action requirement. </seg>
<seg id="8"> With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate reached in Germany in November a twelve-year-record high; in Spain, the rate of 3.6 climbed to 4.1 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Responsible for the climb of the inflation in the Eurozone let the increased groceries and energy prices be. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The MATIF-Weizennotierungen climbed around 88 percent, and the course for soybean reached also a record high since 1973. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Also in cooking oil and milk products, there was a considerable increase in prices in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The world market price for crude oil climbed this year around 52 percent - in the past month reached the price per cask of the black gold almost 100 U.S. dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the EZB the inflation in 2008 of 2.1 will climb to 2.5 percent, to be sure one reckons 2009 with a decline to 1.9 percent. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For the coming 3-4 months, analysts of a 3-Prozent-Inflationsrate 3-Prozent-Inflationsrate PERCENT 3-Prozent-Inflationsrate INFLATION RATE go out, number the annual average rate however with 2.1 percent. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> At the party faithful voters, the difference falls out thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates clearly: More than two-thirds (71 percent) stand one-fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP vis-à-vis. </seg>
<seg id="4"> MDF and SZDSZ lie according to survey under the parliamentary entry hurdle: They come in the total population to two percent. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The amount of the party voters grew in both warehouses by one percent. </seg>

<seg id="6"> In comparison with the last low point, the general economic mood further deteriorated itself - never before was the share of those, that badly" judge "expressed the economic situation of the country than, so highly (41 percent) while further 46 percent consider it to be "rather badly". </seg>
<seg id="7"> After hopefuler outlooks in the spring and summer, the families see the variation of its financial situation again more pessimistically. </seg>
<seg id="8"> For the coming year, the majority of the population calculates goes with a further deterioration of the situation; only one-tenth of an improvement. </seg>
<seg id="9"> A Gallup-survey carried out in December yielded that 71% of the questioned - a historic highly - the work of the prime minister as "sooner badly as right" judged. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Hypermarkets in the Budaörser trade zone retained also this year the average price increase of 16% of the last year, with which difference that it gave this year no increase of the value-added tax. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Article out of Napi Gazdaság</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In the Budaörser trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" increased were registered also this year around 16 percent, to be sure in all Hypermärkten price increases of more than 1,000 HOOVES. </seg>
<seg id="5"> After the prices in the groceries markets in the past December "davongaloppiert" are, the increase in prices prozentuell did not fall out drastically, compared to the anyway high, earlier exit level. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To be sure it does not influence determined the consumers deterrent that that had paid, for what it in the last year yet far under 9,000 HOOVES, this year once for 10,000 HOOVES available is. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The price of the "Napi" shopping basket exceeded the magic 10.000-HUF-Grenze around at least 91 HOOVES in the examined markets. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The highest price amounted to 10,573 HOOVES. </seg>
<seg id="9"> (In 6800 was the price about 6,800 HOOVES). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The prices for Unicum and living fish remained almost on preceding year level, strongly climbed are on the other hand the prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Praise for flour and bread gave the data the headquarters statistical office of Hungary corresponded, in Auchan it however 1kg bread roll for 139 Forint. </seg>
<seg id="12"> There was no competition contingent price slump in the product on less than 200 Forint. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Also surprisingly the price of a two liter Coca-Cola returnable bottle of less than 200 Forint was here, therefore the drink cost seized inclusive only 257 HOOVES. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless cut off this year in the "Napi" shopping basket-comparison Auchan most expensively, and Cora most favorable. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Our calculations yielded that Cora raised the prices in the "Napi" shopping basket vis-à-vis the Weihnachtspreisen in the past year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan respectively around 18 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the preceding year and the most expensive of the new year amounted to 12% while the increase between cheapest shopping basket of the past year and most expensive of the running year 21% settled. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The price climb average amounted to 1,480.00 HOOF. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The average price increase was in the preceding year yet about 1,206.00 Forint, to be sure the value-added increase in taxes became apparent in the praising to last Christmases. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Exactly this process badly encountered the trade: Apparently the department stores were not able to decide so quite, which price margin they should use in the single articles, because the effects of the price increase were unforeseeable on the consumption behavior. </seg>
<seg id="20"> (If the dealer the circulation speed of a product badly plans, can he around essential profits fall in the price margin, that itself after the traffic intensity arranges). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Mehwertsteuer contingently fell out the increase in prices of the "Napi" shopping basket in the past year so radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 around 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference amounted to merely 844 Forint in the cheapest basket. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Such extreme were not observed this year because the most expensive basket cost more around 1,630.00 Forint, than in the preceding year, and even in the cheapest, there was a price climb of 1,284.00 Forint. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In the comparison both last Christmas seasons a catastrophic price increase, that price of the daily commodities in the Hypermärkten climbed is in less than 20 months around more than 30 percent, appeared. </seg>
<seg id="24"> (This again does not confirm unconditionally the data of the headquarters of statistical office of Hungary: In many reason foods, the statistical office in the period of 12 months assessed a more than 30-percent increase in prices. </seg>
<seg id="25"> So in about next to flour also in wobbling). </seg>
<seg id="26"> If one throws however a view into the "Napi" shopping basket, this seems in latter almost impossibly because the price level increased the already in the preceding year of expensive product itself in the worst case around hardly more than 10 percent. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position, than the Eilieferanten - nevertheless could it the drastic price increase on the Multis shift. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> In the golden trade triangle, the Hypermärkte do not lament itself; it is reported running of good years. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores views not more at all on the prices. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Are shopped out of all large quantity, go durable groceries in palette over the counters. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It gave Wednesday morning in all three department stores endless snakes in the cash when sudden the number of the customers exploded. </seg>
<seg id="32"> To be sure a slighter customer frequency is reported of the country so that many Multis lament themselves at the opinion researchers, they could not reach once the planned revenue, and to be sure not only in groceries, but rather also in persistent consumer goods. </seg>

<seg id="1"> In many places is saved at disinfectant</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This year more were registered than thousand infections in hospitals, that were to be led back to an improper contact with antibiotics. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overburdening of the personnel - all factor, that are the damming of the infections not exactly beneficial, so the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many places is saved also in the disinfectants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Traumatologie department of the János hospital, a MRSA-infection was diagnosed lately. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The bacterium resistant against antibiotics was found in a masculine patient, who was delivered after a heavy accident into the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The patient was isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At the beginning of the year, there was here already a similar infection. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The injured of a heavy car accident was released out of the hospital, had to return little later the man to be sure with a MRSA-infection. An important operation could not be carried out since then because of the bacterium, that is still in the body of the patient, yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Until 10 December of this year released infections were reported out of hospitals 1094 through multiresistente pathogen at the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system, so the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center, Karolina Böröcz. </seg>
<seg id="11"> So many, through multiresistente pathogen released infections were registered in the hospitals therefore with security, would be allowed to be however higher the dark figure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) became of the MRSA, that released against Methicillin-Oxacillin of resistant Staphylococcus aureus. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Staphylococcus aureus (SOWED) bacterium carries about one-third of the persons in its nose, without that it would cause an illness. </seg>
<seg id="14"> SOWED-contingent infections (like about sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) react usually well to antibiotics, they are well curable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The means will dose improper used develop from quickly spread themselves to be sure to highly or, that well respondierenden bacteria antibiotics-resistant, that under corresponding conditions in the hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Especially with patients with weakened, or durably badly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with slight body weight these bacteria can heavy infections how about wound infection or blood poisoning cause, therefore sepsis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> According to the MRSA-infection is belong nothing special, such occurrences to the sick house everyday life to the medical leader of the János hospital. </seg>
<seg id="18"> One would not be allowed to confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA does not give it only there where it is not sought. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Resistant to antibiotics</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "Such patients are isolated, the care personnel carries rubber gloves and costumes in the provision, and we control the antibiotics" necessary for the treatment - so Tibor Nyulasi. </seg>
<seg id="21"> In its delivery into the hospital, the patients are examined to be sure on MRSA, not always can be avoided an infection nevertheless. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Sample removals too rarely</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The majority of the infections released by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, to be sure let the presently ruling conditions and circumstances be unfavorable for the checking of the origin or the expansion of the multiresistenten pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and age homes, the hospitals should examine the delivered patients and should isolate MRSA-infected immediately. </seg>
<seg id="25"> In the Hungarian hospitals, the microbiological sample removal becomes however not so frequent practice. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Finally because there are not no subsidies on the part of the national health insurance company for this investigation. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Most cases would come therefore first then at the daylight if the patient has already a noticeable MRSA-infection, so the medical leader of the epidemiology center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> On the part of the European Union, it gives gives strict recommendations to the corresponding use of antibiotics in the humane medicine, it however also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Antibiotic-therapies should be purposeful, that is, are microbiological investigations necessary so that no resistance to can form the means, to be sure this directive also not always is kept of hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Under the ambulatory, or in the reason provision of present patient let microbiological sample removals be themselves even even rarer, so Karolina Böröcz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Saved becomes in the disinfectants</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Scientific proofs belay that MRSA is transferred by a patient to the other most frequently by the care personnel. </seg>
<seg id="33"> For this very reason approaches gives the Händewaschen, or the carrying of gloves and costumes a large meaning, to be sure it also on this zone considerable deficiencies in the hospitals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> MRSA is transmitted through Tröpfcheninfektion or contact, exists in the domestic hospitals however not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The rooms are even often overfills, that lined up beds tightly to each other, although there should be between them from epidemiological point of view a distance of at least 1.5 meters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> How Karolina Böröcz further notices in, comes gives it unfortunately in the financially less well placed hospitals even before that in disinfectant saved becomes, it few caretakers, many patients - all factor that favor the origin of infections quite. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Such infections are there demonstrable far less frequent, or the further distribution of the pathogen can be delayed where these precautions are kept, so Karolina Böröcz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Government program against MRSA</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> To got MRSA-infections into the handle caused the health insurances enormous costs, therefore they are fought everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="40"> In England for example the prevention became of MRSA, and/or its checkings in the government program held. </seg>
<seg id="41"> After first signs, the program is successfully - belay like published data, is the tendency of the MRSA-infections in England retrograde. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The European center for illness prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the origin of multiresistenten pathogens (under that also MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities explains. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Political Capital: Hungarian corps increases country risk</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the opinion of the department for risk analysis (Risk Analysing division) of Political Capital the activities of the corps established Hungarian in this August with support the "movement for a better Hungary" raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several regard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the "risk warning-report" of the institute, it is named among other things: In the connection with the activities of the Hungarian corps, the highest political risk places lead could" the "intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gipsy and not gipsy population in Hungary there, that even short-termed to violent ethnic discussions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Let head reason for that be the strategy of the Hungarian corps, that aims probably on the provocation of such a discussion, so the research institute. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> How reports, this is looked at as a failure of sides of the politically responsible: "Persons of the public life left / the discussion of the Romany-question to representatives of radical political grouping, constructed have" that now its political strategy on the Romany-Hungary-contrast. </seg>
<seg id="6"> One assumes that these intensify the problem, that impossibly make sensible dialogue, extremities favor, as well as the probability of violent discussions increase would become. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Forschungsinsitut does not mean would have moreover, that activities of the Hungarian corps, finally thanks to the enormous attention of sides of the domestic and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad considerably damaged, especially what the confidence into the stability and democratic maturity concerns". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> We remember: Since autumn 2006 the reorganization is of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary continuously in the upswing so that since summers 2007 several were established itself, "national self-defense united" naming organizations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "These groupings is meanly, that it itself respectively as a civil organization define, while it openly therewith boast, its members on - sometimes armed - defense task to prepare (catastrophe protection, national defense, Ordnungshütung), with reference to the unfitness of the police, the army, or the country itself", was named it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> And further: That everything happens in accordance with that method, that tries, different to camouflage on the politics unwillingness and party unwillingness of the population being based, political strivings as a middle class initiative. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The emphasis of the civil character and the united form serve emerge could therefore not merely the evasion of juristic hurdles, that in the train of the entry in court - it is at the same time a political strategy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> How the analysis to take is, the activities of the Hungarian corps represent a risikoerhöhenden factor also for the relations with the neighboring states. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "In the last months the Hungarian corps in several neighboring states was quoted as a potential danger source, sees so many an ultra nationalistic politician of certain neighboring countries in the origin of the Hungarian corps the confirmation of its own Anti-Hungary-politics. </seg>
<seg id="14"> That everything has effects on the political stability of the region" - was named it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The foundation of the Hungarian corps is from the viewpoint the research institute no single phenomenon in headquarters-east-Europe, therefore the political risk grew for the total region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> How reports, the activities of the Hungarian corps are with which the Bulgarian national corps comparable, whose foundation in August 2007 was announced by the radical right-wing Bulgarian national union (BNU). </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian corps, the Romany measure riots, that took place in a quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana), stood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BNU took the occurrences immediately to the occasion to the foundation of the national corps, with which argument that the goal of the organization would be the "national protection". </seg>
<seg id="19"> According to your opinion was remained same in the past 17 years a regular "gipsy terror" in Bulgaria noticeable, the country however inactive and indifferent - so Political Capital. </seg>
<seg id="20"> And further: The initiative would have kicked off a violent debate in the Bulgarian public. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> How said, the increased risk for ethnic discussions is belaid also through the fact that some Bulgarian Romany-organizations announced to establish its own corps to resistance purposes. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Because the activities of the Hungarian corps until now many resemblances with which the Bulgarian national corps show it is not to be excluded that the Hungarian Romany also, with whom organizing of its own protection react to the threats, it is named in the risk warning report of Political Capital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Attila Juhász, research director in Political Capital said on inquiry of the message office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Annually risk analysis reports would be published, and risikoverändernden tendencies should be recognizable, is informed the public opinion, like in the case through the publication of the risk warning report. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Six deterrent trifles in order to annoy working colleague</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Never receive e-mails that we to post forget language messages, that we - harmless lies, that are noticeable us not at all more: They bring "color" into the everyday life at the job. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The question is merely whether one becomes accustomed to these small unpleasantnesses, or one stands better the challenge and tries these misleading, for other annoying situations deliberately to vermweiden. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Tips. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Sorry, I forgot to align that someone has" called of the marketing-department - says a colleague to you. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Did that one neglect through it a Meeting? </seg>
<seg id="7"> At best one regretted it and to rectify tried it in that one calls perhaps in the marketing-department and stood remorseful, one would have forgotten to align the message (that is the less usual method). </seg>
<seg id="8"> Usually the thing with an apology is removed. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Before one entangles himself into embarrassing excuses, one should consider wherewith one can its colleague moments of truly unpleasant ready and try to avoid these situations deliberately. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Loaned something, what not belongs one even? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> There is hardly somewhat more irritating as if one grasps after a document, office accessories, or the telephone, but it is not there. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Did yesterday the notebook device lie yet on the desk - today early is it away? </seg>
<seg id="13"> Is that or lost discovered believed ball-point pens about on the desk of a colleague? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Without ask should one himself nothing of the colleagues loan, for it right will annoy if it assess, that somewhat gotten away is. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Therefore, no envelopes or postal service it it out of the office into the pocket stick could encounter, for it one even: keins more there if one needs it yet urgently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Getratsche over private life of the colleagues? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> There is no effective means to delay a gossip, that was set already into the world. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Who with whom made, what? </seg>
<seg id="19"> Where and why? </seg>
<seg id="20"> One should not tie the information (or suppositions) over private life of the colleagues if possible every to the nose! </seg>
<seg id="21"> And if someone opens herself yet and betrays us its most internal secret, should not abuse we this confidence! </seg>
<seg id="22"> Best one is quiet like a grave instead of aligning the just not present even if other know also over the problems of the colleague. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Reported without reason suffer? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If one calls in the office in order to call in sick with reference to tormenting headache because one feels just unwell, or simply only would like to rest itself, should became clear be one over one in that: The own work, urgent settlement, projects with firm appointments the colleagues must now instead of one even settle. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The colleague therefore not vilely play! </seg>
<seg id="26"> If one knows already on the day before, that one will not create it at the next day into the office, or that something could dazwischenkommen, why one must remain at home, should report one it on time so that neither the colleagues, yet the boss are confronted unexpectedly with the absence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> G sharp ummahs, chuckle, telephoning</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Is one deepened just in its work, is disturbed however suddenly by the loud chuckle of the colleague? </seg>
<seg id="29"> Overheard unintentional a telephone conversation, that one better not should have heard? </seg>
<seg id="30"> One should not irritate the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (that one over its heads away leads), Getrampel, lasting scolding or grumbling. </seg>
<seg id="31"> That everything can be very disturbing, also if they are not deepened just in a task (write, plan, organize). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Is the other guilt always? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> If a project is not timely finished, one forgot an important letter or important message to post, should seek one the guilt of the own forgetfulness not with others! </seg>
<seg id="34"> If possible one should not dissuade himself on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues! </seg>
<seg id="35"> Best one its mistakes vouched excuses themselves, and themselves if other were concerned also therefrom! </seg>
<seg id="36"> The question how one rectify the mistake, or can make up the neglected, is mounted only all too! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In the office - a feeling such as at home? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Training pair of pants and Schlapfen: Comfortably for at home, did nothing lose however in the office! </seg>
<seg id="39"> Once then one should not clothe himself so leger if it the job actually would allow! </seg>
<seg id="40"> Merely to sloppy become not - one should both its colleagues, and itself so far respect, that one itself in the office corresponding to clothes - if desires, also lovely and elegantly! </seg>

<seg id="9"> The appearance of Yonderboi, so many a new and exciting production out of the domestic digital Underground-scene contribute slowly to a variation of the general view, and even if the garage skirt with its Gitarrengequitsche is again "in", the domestic Electropop proves: There is new under the sun. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Balázs Zságer began in Pécs, played itself in the volume Yonderboi before it - perhaps, because a tavern no two pipers endures - began to follow its own way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The breakthrough with its project (Zagar) and its music, the elements out of jazz, Electronic, and pop fuses, created approached was it however first as one with the favor to compose the Soundtrack to a film, at it (z. B. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "Szezon" of Ferenc Török). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The formation, that had appeared originally in smaller club, became the wider public first well known, than the magazine „wan2" its first album from the year 2002 under the Top 50 domestic albums lined up and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to the nearly only, also in the west marketable trendsetter kürte. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Doubtless Zagar and its volumes were interested "trendy", it however no whether they carry this sign also gladly. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The volumes reacted, should how it: With a new, even better album. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The now appeared new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open them new ways, to be sure the title presses already the wish after continuity with the Pécser years from. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The expression originates namely the time when Balázs Zságer was yet with another volume underway. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The airy, flying allusion would be also in order, to be sure that - the zeitgeist and the trend corresponding - are noticeable next to the ethereal character of the music pure guitar, the influences of the rock'n'roll. </seg>
<seg id="19"> With these songs, that in England living and with the volume "The Puzzle" working singers György Ligeti imagined in the premiere in the Millenáris. </seg>
<seg id="20"> A song of the album created it even to the radio pop song - that since newest MR2 sending by early until late pop music set the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", that was received with the assistance of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas",), successive the ear worm. </seg>
<seg id="21"> All in order therefore (?). </seg>
<seg id="22"> The hvg. hu inquired in Balázs Zságer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Hvg. hu: This new hit raises the question: Does to what extent layer remain reserve your music of a conscience? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Balázs Zságer: The concept "layer music" does not mean me just much. </seg>
<seg id="25"> According to my opinion it does not give two boxes in the pop music, and to be sure Mainstream and Underground, or alternatively and pop, but rather commercially and honestly. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Even the so-called alternative-music-or-Underground-music can be shallow and meaningless, can produce become just as it however also only for the sale, that makes it to commercial music. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Also a good pop-number can develop from an honest subject. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The reception readiness of the listener functions also after this principle, of languages and country boundary independently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Hvg. hu: Do you see a difference in the candor of the Hungarian and the foreign public vis-à-vis your music? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, the pop music has a larger tradition. </seg>
<seg id="31"> There not only teenager or Twens go on concerts, but rather also the older public. </seg>
<seg id="32"> They pursue the trends in the pop music that happen around it around, much more attentively because they consider it also to be a part of the contemporary culture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Hvg. hu: Which roll comes the public to in your work? </seg>
<seg id="34"> It is hear important, who, where, wieviele your music? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> B. Zs.: It is natural a good feeling, to see that more and more to our concerts come. </seg>
<seg id="36"> We never composed however for the market. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Here the music does not emerge in order to serve a purpose, but rather for a certain reason. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The roll of the public is usually in the concerts noticeably where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is that again only in the intangible variations of the moment. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Nevertheless is been noticeable me one: If you quite want to make it all, you are no longer interesting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Hvg. hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi? </seg>
<seg id="41"> It is as a soloist underway and constructed its career sooner in the west. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> B. Zs.: We do not go really its way, once therefrom entirely seen that one tries again and again to read into this into our music. </seg>
<seg id="43"> We see ourselves sooner than team Player, that let trust on the musical presence of the other and can be unfolded it. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Originally were natural comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi unavoidable because several of us come out of its volumes and hit another way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Hvg. hu: In the Charts of MR2, "Wings takes precedence of Love". </seg>
<seg id="46"> Many heard not until the name Zagar to the connection with this number. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Was the opening with one deliberately produced somewhat more popular style toward a wider public? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, that should serve then as a train horse for the album. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In this song, it concerns more. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It was thought as a finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult subjects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Hvg. hu: How did you select the six singers? </seg>
<seg id="52"> Why was just it, what the Leitprinzip? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> B. Zs.: The basic idea was, to make a Gospel-good choir. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Then the idea came to assemble the choir out of gifted soloist of the domestic music scene. </seg>
<seg id="55"> So the six headed choir emerged - therefore Sena, Eden Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh -, that we then apäter "Underground Divas" baptized have. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> Hvg. hu: Did you want to have the song just as, or the girls have it with shape? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> B. Zs.: There was was finished the number already more long in the instrumental version, but as the material for the album, thought we us that this number needs" yet "something. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The accord sequence demanded formally after a song voice. </seg>
<seg id="59"> I warmed up the melody yet in the same night, learned later it the girls. </seg>
<seg id="60"> All came practically on attempt and frightening spontaneously. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I can remember, I was galvanizeed at that time rather, but it needed already also the "Divas". </seg>
<seg id="62"> With my voice alone the song never would have become so strong. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Hvg. hu: Both on the disk, and in the concert one had however the impression that would be girl in the background. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There is no solo-part (seen of the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own roll, sing perfectly together and are not more loudly, than the music, therefore its song not only is accompanied of the music. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Also on the stage, they stood behind. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Is it intention? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67"> B. Zs. : That they are stood behind, was because of purely technical problems so. </seg>
<seg id="68"> To be sure we wanted to approach let them deliberately no solo-rolls. </seg>
<seg id="69"> In the number, it goes also therefore that one should forget its ego a few, forget, who come from where and is where underway, let we simply to that us these certain wings that wings raise the dear. </seg>
<seg id="70"> I would have gladly that also other sense this euphoric condition, that we sensed, when the song emerged. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> Hvg. hu: Which was the costliest song? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> B. Zs.: In the musical Schaffensarbeit actually quite no, it gave sooner more difficult tasks in the mixing. </seg>
<seg id="73"> For example in "Dorian Gray's it dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or in „Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls" where the Groove not more long wanted to function, but gradually everything joined itself, like in a Puzzle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> Hvg. hu: Which is your favorite number of the new album? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75"> B. Zs.: That changes with the concerts running and also now that I have the album "losgelasssen". </seg>
<seg id="76"> Presently "Never The seed" are it "prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, it is created. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The country household is approved. </seg>
<seg id="4"> What is special at this household? </seg>
<seg id="5"> The first household that this government sketched, and that is supposed became without support of the opposition by the coalition majority. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That for the running year was approved yet with support of that (social democrat) because it minister Sobotka (of this party) had produced, and that was not able to permit itself it therefore to reject it. </seg>

<seg id="9"> That is to a certain extent paradoxical. </seg>
<seg id="10"> All reigning does not begin and ends with the single chapters and post of the household whether one that pleases or. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The household is an essential component of the politics, is covered however through the power struggle of the government and the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="12"> That is for the media a more grateful subject, and therefore they dedicate more attention to it. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A dispute under politicians is for the public much interesting as sober numbers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The country households suffered at the past social-democratic governments from three weak points, that the household cannot remove for the year 2008 all at once: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The first is the high share of editions that are of law because of obligating, whereby it concerns not only the pensions, but rather also around social editions, that concluded the "tacit" coalition of and (communist) in the last year before the choices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The second is the budgetary policies in deficit as a consequence of the first weak point. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="17"> The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the budgets deficits of the communities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The largest risk is not however the national budget deficit. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This household is public and eingermaßen under inspection. </seg>
<seg id="20"> A true time bomb is however the budget deficit of the communities. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Many mayors issued in order to open further sources except receipts out of taxes, duties and bank credit for investments, often inconsiderately bonds, through that it its city halls in the excess of debt-ridden. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In the last years, it succeeded them, these guilt through abundant sale of shares of the energy networks and of other provision networks, that had received it in the course of the denationalization of the country, off number. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Now this source is already failed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> As far as we comply only with official and verifiable facts, let's assess, that: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Our economy already since some years, like the remainder of the world, a growth phase passes through, whose itself that without intermission praises. </seg>
<seg id="26"> That represented a unique possibility for its governments to bring the public finances in order. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Instead debt-ridden these governments the country however yet more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Other countries, apart from a couple of exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, much more sensibly managed than our republic. </seg>
<seg id="29"> That is a giant shame that is to be attributed predominantly the earlier governments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> We belong to the countries, that are threatened, in the global standard seen, at the least of poverty. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Therefore no nassiven social programs are inflated became necessary, that unfortunately just in the last years very superfluously in gigantic size. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Also if it is arrive to paint a part of the absurd populist editions, that were dismissed this year before the choices,, is clearly that if it does not come in next time to a postponement of the retirement age and to a pension reform, ends is practically each politics in this country, and, entire same who at the power, will remain it nothing as a pure administering. </seg>
<seg id="33"> It only easily is exaggerated if one says, that then out of ruling politicians officials become, who divide the largest part of the tax collections mechanically on pensions and social editions. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Therefore this year's household can be no revolution, but rather can command only the displacement of normal editions through duty editions restraint. </seg>
<seg id="35"> That for 2008 planned deficits of 70 billion crowns would be thoroughly superfluously if earlier governments had not issued in the last ten years, what only went. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If we do not want, that it comes really in addition, that out of ruling politicians pure administration officials become, we must be patient and am this not all too strong coalition government that deliberately is itself however its that the country can issue only so much to take in like he at taxes and fees in a position, wish quiet in the preparation of further reform laws. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> "This step should remove the largest difficulties of the economy, therefore the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consultation firm wrote Economic Outlook Group in a report for its customers. </seg>

<seg id="12"> "It looks so that the situation is really bad," said it further. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The headquarters banks have the fear that if the banks have even heavily access to loans, for its customers credit also more expensively become. </seg>
<seg id="14"> That would diminish the consumption and would fall the American economy into a recession, possibly with effects on the economic growth in the entire world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The headquarters banks decided in addition after it was not arrive them, that so-called. To layer LIBOR, that Londoner Interbankzinssatz, that is used in the money distribution between banks. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That means that the banks had permanently anxiety to lend itself mutually money, and that although the headquarters banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain had layered during the autumn its interests rates repeatedly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "That will have the same effect like a further reduction of the interests rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the agency Reuters. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Voruteile fade</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In order to say the truth, I a special fan of the Peugeot never was 206. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Its handling characteristics were not much valued, one could the quality of the gearshift, the control and also the processing as rather below average designate. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Yet now its successor, the Peugeot 207 is, on the market, and that is better around much. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Kombi with the label SW is remains me another piece further, and only to revise my opinion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When I had tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, I had to complain for example about the too slight head freedom on the rear seat. </seg>
<seg id="7"> There are these troubles now no longer, for the car body of the Kombi is formed so that once two meter men will not suffer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Quickly further</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> I go through the interior equipment only shortly in order to not to repeat myself to very. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It concerns a quite gelungenes design where I have only because of the miserable means tunnel of objections. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There I would welcome somewhat more designerische formation where the car makes otherwise a so elegant impression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The seats are comfortable, and past the times are where we complained possibly about too short seats or head support. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Also the side stop improved itself vis-à-vis that 206 substantially. </seg>
<seg id="14"> One can sense what concerns the room offer, also here the enlarged dimensions of the car body. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In the Kombi, also the already mentioned lack of head freedom is removed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Suitcase in the trunk</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The essential matter at this vehicle is however the cargo space. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I (also because of the folding rear window) must that as beladbar very good and space-saving designate. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The cavities are equipped with stop belts, that represent an ideal compromise. </seg>
<seg id="20"> They do not disturb, let themselves auseinanderziehen and hold also heavier objects firmly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But let's maintain us over the drawer volume. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It amounts to according to table in the reason equipment 428 liters what in comparison with the competition a rather average value is. </seg>
<seg id="23"> To be sure not in comparison with the vehicle top-selling in the Czech Republic of this class, that Škoda Fabia comboes. </seg>
<seg id="24"> If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of the product out of Mladá Boleslav, let's assess that the Peugeot remains around clearly noticeable 52 liters. </seg>
<seg id="25"> For a foreign country vacation or in the inviting of a baby carriage, this value is already critical. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In order around to emphasize the Positiva, I must mention yet the cargo space entirely flat after the folding down the backs seats or also the very low drawer edge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> 120 HP in four rows</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Our test vehicle was equipped with a Vierzylinder-Benzinmotor with Hubraum 1.6 liters and an achievement of 88 kW. </seg>
<seg id="29"> And honestly said, should look a 1600-Kubik-Motor 1600-Kubik-Motor CUBIC 1600-Kubik-Motor MOTOR, that drives a family-Hatchback. </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is soft, has a slight consumption and pulls well away. </seg>
<seg id="31"> If I compare it to its counterpart in Škoda, that causes sometimes, as its exhaust with a rag would be clogged, only can enthuse be I by it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The price list speaks volumes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The price of this vehicle is not exactly popular. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We must remember however that we tested a well equipped car with a roomy interior and a very good motor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> The basic price of the car with the 1400er gasoline motor in the amount of 329900 crowns concerns yet. </seg>
<seg id="36"> With our motor, it costs from 410900 crowns, what already rather much is. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The equipment Premium of the test vehicle contributes significantly once again with 80000 crowns in addition. </seg>
<seg id="38"> We had to be sure Kopfairbags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic Scheibenwischerauslösung, electric window siphons behind and and... </seg>
<seg id="39"> So the car costs crowns altogether simple 531900. </seg>
<seg id="40"> That is a quantity, but add up once the addition equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive in an entirely similar sum. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Therefore the decision remains only which sign one wants to select. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Which insurance is suitable for me best? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The MOTOR VEHICLE-insurance, that uncovers a case of damage caused possible by the driver, includes a high costs expense, whose height wiederrum of different factors depends, among other things on age, sex, moment of the creation of the driver's license, marital status, type of the car to be assured and its utilization, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> To possess a car only the beginning is. </seg>
<seg id="4"> For it is to be found even more hard the suitable MOTOR VEHICLE-insurance than the correct vehicle model. </seg>
<seg id="5"> First of all once must be clear one wherewith we have to do it here. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This agreement is held in writing by means of an insurance contract, that determines that the company receives the arranged insurance premium and is obligated in return to produce in a case of damage the corresponding settlement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that puts together itself through several factors, among other things age, sex, moment of the creation of the driver's license, marital status, type of the vehicle to be assured or its utilization. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The insurance companies fix its prices corresponding to the statistics so that in a higher accident danger also higher contribution payments become due. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> For this reason must both perform belay less contribution payments over 25-year-old and women, for statistics that these groups show a slighter accident quota thanks to its caution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The same applies also to married persons, there this after statements of the statistical values and accordingly also after conviction of the businesses, to less accidents tend like single. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The utility that is ascribed the vehicle impairs the frequency of the going and therewith also the probability of an accident. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The more frequent the utilization, the more probable the damage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In the assembly of the premium, the insurances must consider a whole series of points. </seg>
<seg id="15"> For this reason also the driver thoroughly must study the situation in order to select exactly the car insurance, that meets its personal needs at that soon. </seg>
<seg id="16"> We list the most important points here now, that one should take in the selection of an insurance into consideration, in order to be able to encounter not only an achievement, but rather also a preisorientierte choice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> That under 25-year-old encounter in the choice of a bargain insurance on numerous hindrances, e.g. the slight driving experience and the driver's license. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Even if it would be for an ideal insurance protection best, to lock a Vollkaskoversicherung, it gives nevertheless more low-priced alternative. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The careful drivers can select a Vollkasko with deductible so that the achievements of a Vollkaskoversicherung uncovered to be sure, but are offered to a low price. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This type of contract includes that the customer must pay a part of the sum emerged by the damage itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Sum is determined before conclusion of the contract and based on the height of the insurance premium. This is declared more highly the more slightly that to be paid Luis Noguera, head representative of Spain in First Europe, one settlement enterprising to be Online-insurances. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Another option is not the expanded insurance, that assures the customer against external accident damages, however against the damages emerged at the own car. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Moreover this type of the insurance would uncover theft, fire and vehicle loss. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Here an advice. </seg>
<seg id="25"> If you are old under 25 years, it lies increases in your hand, to sink the insurance costs; so your credit in that you try to go carefully and to avoid accidents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> A credit is a decline of the basis tariff at the corresponding insurance company. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In the opposite in addition included a punishment payment a raising purported tariff. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Height credit and punishment payments depend on the company and its yields. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the business has a yield empire year behind itself, it can permit itself, clarifies the bonus-payments too Noguera. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> As soon as the 25-Jahre-Marke 25-Jahre-Marke years 25-Jahre-Marke SIGN is exceeded, it is to be locked for the drivers simpler a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving experience the accident quota sinks. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Therefore it is the most meaningful to decide on a Vollkaskoversicherung with deductible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The youths can pull no utility out of its previous experience, both in the case an accident and at the time the going that of directors Spanish of the European business clarifies joins, and thereto that the majority of the accidents happen in the second practice year, after that was discarded the. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Nevertheless it is at a married customer, who possesses no children, more advisable to lock a Vollkaskoversicherung; naturally only then if it allows the financial situation of the corresponding person also. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> On the part of the insurer, married couples with children count as the customers with the slightest accident quota, and accordingly low also its contribution payments fall from. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> In this case, a Vollkaskoversicherung with deductible (in a sum about 300 Euro) would be the best option. In the case that one received a high credit, recommends itself an expanded insurance that uses first to the third vehicle year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Altogether more relaxed go and possess a larger buying power that permits it them, a higher contribution payment places Luis Noguera firmly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> For pensioner, it offers itself to lock a Vollkaskoversicherung with deductible (in a sum about 150 Euro), or an expanded insurance, that uses first in a sufficiently high credit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> In the end one must hold that the car insurance is somewhat very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damages, but rather rescues also, because it high costs, that require it, that a thorough selection is encountered, that corresponds to our personal situation. </seg>

<seg id="2"> If Romey avoided said, it would not hold it a presidency candidate laud to be questioned of a snow man. </seg>

<seg id="4"> None of the questions, that on Wednesday evening, the 28 November, raised became, were as laughable as the snow man, the democrats over the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party questioned. </seg>
<seg id="5"> But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time exactly the condition of the republican party, that breaks open into the choices in the next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It is not well known, exactly like the makers of CNN, that the debate sometimes support that selected the concerning candidate to showing YouTube Clips. </seg>
<seg id="7"> However in the first half hour of the debate, that was dedicated longest that to a single subject, immigration in the midpoint stood. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The subject is one of the most powerful subjects for republican. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The CNN asked to serve a group of undecided voters a dial if they heard things, that filed them: The television company noted spoke tip of the approval as the candidates exertally over the boundaries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The sharpest and longest exchange the evenings was between Rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner, and Romney that pushed itself in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire forwards. </seg>
<seg id="11"> To shake off Giuliani tried the call, it had been yielding with respect to illegal immigration when it was mayor of New York. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It attacked accused Romney in that it the former governor of Massachusetts to have adjusted illegal immigrants for work at its house. </seg>

<seg id="15"> None both men has earnest chances in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they chopped earlier and more hard than other on the immigration kettledrum. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At least in the area of the immigration, the candidates in the large and entire divide the same views: sharper boundaries, intolerance vis-à-vis illegal migrant. </seg>

<seg id="20"> John McCain and Romney discussed about whether simulated drowning should be regarded as a torture. </seg>

<seg id="23"> A further questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Mike Huckabee - now contrary to all expectations on the first place in a survey carried out recently in Iowa thanks to its for some time existing Christian conservativism - said that the death penalty would be painful, but necessary. </seg>
<seg id="25"> When he was pressed on that, whether Jesus would advocate it, he laughed about that and said was Jesus too intelligently around itself around a political office to apply. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Gordon Brown discovered another further pit to the Hineinfallen; its way out of this out the same remains. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> For British scandals, this is not especially slippery. </seg>
<seg id="4"> No nobility titles seem pays sold, no politician Parisian hotel calculations to have become no extramarital toes gelutscht. </seg>
<seg id="5"> But the disclosure that a rich businessman has disguises contributions for the British reigning Labour party over more than a 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollar) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party neglected to report this, is fought over come out would be somewhat without that of that Gordon Brown well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When two months ago the Prime Minister had withdrawn himself from the demand for of a choice, on dämliche type and manner the intelligence of the Britons insulting in that he maintained, that opinion survey would not have influenced this decision, gave it hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Instead, how Vince Cable, the of representation chair shrewd in increasing mass that liberally democrats, it expressed, has itself the once feared Brown by Stalin to Mr. Bean develops. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The awkward rescue of Northern skirt, a marred bank, showed regulatorische weakness and bad judgment done under gunfire. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Badly reasoned have proposals to the change the tax laws business associations against the government raised. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The tax official loss of people-related data of 25 million persons showed unimaginable administrative bungling up. </seg>
<seg id="11"> A trio of generals in the retirement started an uprising in the waiter house out of protest against abridgments of military editions: Ministers of the military forces to be, maintained it, would be a part-time job. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now it gives already resigned the manifold contributions of David Abrahams; Peter watt, Labours secretary-general (and its earlier fulfillment leader). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Nothing therefrom means that Brown breaks open irrevocably direction retirement. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless governments can reach a turning point to reign impossibly perceive it after that it. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Neither yet like to trust person politicians, but hold it normally its scepticism back if a new troop seizes the office. </seg>
<seg id="16"> If it once clearly is, that it unlikely is, that a prime minister improves the situation, and he yet once long does not need to be there, is this delay past: the public service begins to become leaky; the cabinet ministers begin to chat; the press searches for bad messages; and the government becomes defensive and aimless. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In a manner the position of Brown is especially difficult because it cannot maintain in contrast to other political leaders to be a new broom. </seg>
<seg id="18"> So gladly it Tony Blair deny would become, was it its lieutenant. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The problems with Northern skirt and the tax responsibility documents, for example, hang together with decisions, that encountered Brown as a chancellor of the treasury. </seg>
<seg id="20"> And even if that not directly involved was come into Blairs misfortunes - like in the long "moneys for nobility title" -investigation from political party financing - the voters possibly therefrom that he were it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Nevertheless Browns situation is not entirely as bad as it looks</seg>
<seg id="22"> The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> How in Mr. Bean, no one died completely was cheated, or. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And the remedy, painfully how it be likes, is to be delivered, what Browns always promised naturally stalinistische tendencies: A dependable, solidly and easily brutal government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The new Getue around political contributions is a good example. </seg>
<seg id="26"> It says would wish the garboeske Abrahams, that its contributions with its public-spirited gifts compares, no public recognition for its goodwill. </seg>
<seg id="27"> That likes to be perhaps so, but stood the decision about that it not to. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The laws against anonymity for large political contribution payers are clear and it exist for an unambiguous reason: the public is right an on that to know, who reign himself access to which buy can, that the country. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It says would have known watt, that of Abrahams agreement, but not that it is illegal, will have to ask itself obviously some questions; exactly like Jon Mendlesohn, Labours Hauptfinanzeintreiber, that was told over the strange contributions in October. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Yet previously Brown is not involved: There is nothing that on that points, that it knew of these confusions, although the largest part of the payments was made after its office acceptance in June. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Previously the prime minister settled the half of the work. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It convicted quickly the injury of the laws through its party, but it diluted this determination through the grasping after a well known instrument, an investigation sow shot to the subject - led in order to make the measure fully, of a bishop in the retirement and a judge. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In this case, that are not complicated "from that to pulling apprenticeships" very. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If the law was broken, it is a thing for the police. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Seen gives therefrom it other things the Mr. Brown make must to find like something a permanent chairperson for the independent from shot for standards in the public life, that is since six months unoccupied, and ahead step with a sweeping reform of political party financing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> That would require of the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservative and to abandon possibly the special financial relation with the labor unions - bitter pill for a party comrade such as Mr. Brown. </seg>
<seg id="37"> But it should be aware itself some partial facts. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The conservatives have now a clear leadership in the opinion surveys; he has to recover two years around voter; and the single way how he can reach a victory, is through incontestable uprightness and solid competence. </seg>

<seg id="1"> England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Here two dilemmas, each of them almost just as hard like the other. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Who should strike as a number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara? </seg>
<seg id="4"> And, fewer relevantly in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should the decision not encounter? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second question is important because David Graveney, the choice chair is, on proclamation at least under this special title, here in order to help the boss trainer Peter of bog and the captain Michael Vaughan at the same time to decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director fills itself, gradually with application for national voter offices, if not even for which in part-time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He, who does not get also always the sixth beater position, will be unfortunate, but life is often unjust and the sport is it undoubted. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It never is enabled simple, exact festzunageln, what a person to reach the tip of its occupation branches while someone out never gets differently over the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of good fortune instead of capacity. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is not only in the Kricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, that always at the end are subjective. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Is it the correct moment for Bopara to climb? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Is it fairly to Shah if it does it? </seg>
<seg id="11"> The same can perhaps also in an area further asked become whether for example John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young management with good conclusion that know the business well should be conveyed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Who say can, what the correct class is for a Kricketspieler, unless, it the possibility is given, to swim or to sink. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Obviously numbers have a large influence on decisions, but chances have this also. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Within a team, a Kricketspieler must catch the eye of the captain to the correct moment if he can take a Wicket and a beater must regular chances on the order get if he wants to make as an one-day Kricketspieler impression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> To catch the eyes of the selection more complicated is. </seg>
<seg id="16"> There was many, that in the last season better than, for example when James Anderson were, that will play apparently in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares itself to be healthy and like the wind into the networks kegelt. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 Runs apiece in order to earn a position in this tour. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same directed average, but both had its highlights and hope for yet more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Whether Shah or Bopara in the Asgiriya stage plays, can be only one view sought after. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it makes perhaps yet little difference. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty in every test played and was was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs, it however Paul Collingwood, at that time yet fighting for to consolidate itself, created that the breakthrough to an important Testkricketspieler and that although it still is underestimated a double hundred against Australia in Australia punktete, perhaps. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Is probable that Graveney, Vaughan and bog will follow, after a further discussion in the course of the current network session in the Asgiriya stage its conservative instinct and belly feeling practical larger for Shahs knowledge of Boparas youthful enthusiasm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> There are arguments for both. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For Shah, its twinkling and valuable 88 test-debut-Innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara that at 22 years of age seven years is younger, and an excellent balance against turned on rolling speaks. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But Shah made was healthy only ten Runs in its two Innings in the May against west Indies in the test in lord, its homeland arenas as a player out of Middlesex, and this, plus its immediate rejection of the selections as a Vaughan in order to turn back its position for the next game, seems taken the momentum out of its striking to have, that was obvious yet in Bombay. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In contrast to that the all-rounder has joie de vivre out of Essex by the shovelful. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is impressed of nothing on a Kricketplatz and was brought its bearing to one side of therefrom on the point when it had recently a vehicle with four wheel drive in a display for England sponsor Volkswagen überschlagen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> It suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first what it did, was its Vodafone (naturally also gesponsort) to get out and to call its team colleague Alastair Cook, to say that this had observed from a distance, and with enthusiasm: Do "you have that g sharp marriages?". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Bopara is a much better field player, he kegelt its means speed with some effect here on the playing fields, what seems and strikes to fit to it with confidence and skill. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> To select the correct man a thing is, to select the correct moment another. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Perhaps that is the actual art of the selection. </seg>
<seg id="32"> I tend to give in addition Bopara now its chance, what does not mean, that Shah will stand there perhaps not yet well, if, how the tea sentence suggests from Ceylon, it that one is, that will play here this weekend. </seg>

</hl>

<seg id="2"> The Venus is thought in spite of its life hostile atmosphere of the earth more similarly than until now: The European space probe "Venus express" discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind turbulence at the Poland how they appear in the winter also on the earth. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> For almost three decades scientists have assumed that it flashes on the Venus. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Now the European probe furnished "Venus express" the proof - it sensed electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere up: The flashes on the Venus shoot in a height of approximately 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "nature". </seg>

<seg id="6"> Not so on the Venus: "If it ever life there gave, must it in the very early story been its", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Today there would be allowed to be hardly something living on the surface of the Venus: The atmosphere is approximately hundred time poet as on the earth, it rule sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "The Venus is perhaps the devil twin of the earth, but it is a twin", said Russel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Why the Venus, that is so similar to the earth in mass and size, hit, a so completely other development, the reason question of the Esa-mission is. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 a milestone was for the Venus-research because since beginning of the nineties no more probe was expressly to the investigation of this planet underway. </seg>

<seg id="12"> "You show also, that the commonalities of our neighbor planet with the earth more largely are than first of all supposed", divides the Esa with. </seg>
<seg id="13"> So the researchers found also a cloud swirl next to the already well known turbulence wind at the north pole at the south pole, that revolves yet substantially faster. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The phenomenon reminds one of air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a researcher team around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The two most internal planet of the solar system has almost the same mass such as the earth and is almost just as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The planet designated also as morning star or evening star circles in almost 225 days around the sun. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="18"> Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees centigrade and a pressure reminds one of 92 cash hardly of the earth, scientists assume that both planets emerged under entirely similar prerequisites. </seg>

<seg id="2"> With "The Hunting party" and "homicidal peace", again two films with the Balkan Peninsula war busy themselves. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Yet both do not convince. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Either the drafts set too much on Action and Geballer or however it are too sentimental. </seg>
<seg id="5"> There also Richard Gere in "The Hunting party" cannot help. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The good message first: To be sure the war criminals hide themselves Karadzic and Mladic still in the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula, but calculated there, in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnia-war, was regained now the actor Richard Gere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> We had lost the most beautiful man of the eighties years finally out of the eyes because all too many nicely-insignificant rolls in Wohlfühlfilmen expelled for women and all too many press conferences to the subject of buddhism one the desire on Hinsehen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Is now Richard Gere itself sudden the most important argument, "The Hunting party - if the hunters to the hunted becomes" must be (why film title today actually always so long and confused like engineer-tariff agreements?) perhaps yet to look at. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It delivers one wonderfully augenzwinkernde representation: In the reason taken is its war reporter Simon Hunt that what would have been able to become out of Gere, if the fate and the film industry were not so gracious: A man, who has its very best times long behind itself, the remainder yet considerable however even as ruins same monument its decline of the former charm preserved has. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But in spite of this trump, "The Hunting party" continues together with the German production "homicidal peace" that starts also in this week, only the endless row of failed Balkan Peninsula war-films. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> With "homicidal peace", one can make short process: The film is rescue about two German soldier in the Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), the one Serbin before kosovarischen sniper whereon the one falls in love promptly also yet with it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although it is begrüßenswert, that here once the Serben are not represented as an exclusive root of all evil, the TV flat film loses itself all too quickly in Geballer and Action. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It remains a type "alarm for Cobra 11" without freeway however for that with war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> On the other hand can be investigated at "The Hunting party" quite in an exemplary manner why there was actually never a correctly good Balkan Peninsula war film. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The story of three US war reporters that open itself to track around the Serbian waiter war criminal "the fox" down, would have been able to become other director and one with one other script author (both in personnel union Richard Shepard) another time perhaps a new "Apocalypse Now". </seg>
<seg id="16"> For the stories are alike astonishing: Both times go small teams into the forest in order to complete something, what the military cannot and both times becomes it a trip into the insanity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting party" is that one does not let be Simon Hunt simple the come down cynic with heart, when that he is introduced us at the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="18"> No, the Script must impute in addition another romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin to it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Finally "The Hunting party" goes then the stream down if the reporter within the last five minutes in the Zeitrafferverfahren that succeeds, what Nato, CIA and all head money hunters of the world in five years did not create: The war criminal catch and leave the Muslim Bosniern to the just revenge. </seg>
<seg id="20"> That is so bad that one would like to call the international court in the Hague because of crime against the movie theater logic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> At the same time the film has a deeply human concern. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic yet always freely run around, and it suspects to not to operate the Americans and the Frenchmen (here should it itself exceptionally once united be) the pursuit based on secret political arrangements all too intensively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But the good meant and that are angry itself sometimes so similar that one a famous breaks-poem comes into the sense. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Therein it is named over the wood costume of an Asian demon on the working table of the poet: "Sympathetic I see the swollen forehead veins, indicating: like strenuous it is, badly to its". </seg>
<seg id="25"> Film like "The Hunting party" such threshold heads that indicate however have exactly how strenuous it is, to be good. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan Peninsula war film. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Recently is would report become in this newspaper that all Iraq-films were flops large Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="28"> One can add: There was also never a good South Africa-film. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Almost always counts: If a star gads itself on the trouble spot or mine fields of the world, comes so somewhat at the same time out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "hereafter of all boundaries" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Possibly all the conflicts are temporally simply yet too near. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Decades had to pass nevertheless before Hollywood with "Schindlers list" was able to turn a good film over the Holocaust. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Many a film becomes well yet ripe - the Vietnam-works valid now as classic "The deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "abundance Metal jacket" were celebrated at that time in no way unanimously as master works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> But perhaps we know today where every measure murders in real time on immediately two screens at home comes, also simply too much over the conflicts of the world. </seg>
<seg id="34"> And that steals the script clerks the Bedenkenlosigkeit that needs it in order to tell good stories. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Are or became not ware" or "the large dictator" in the end also therefore so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet, how badly the Nazi regime really ruled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Perhaps one may not be good want if one wants to make good films. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Perhaps one must have the sarcastic dissociated artist view of the Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk. </seg>
<seg id="38"> When that was questioned to parallels between its historic novel "Lemprières dictionary" and the Balkan Peninsula war, it answered: "That lies only that some things never change. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Metropolises will be always terribly dangerous, persons will be murdered always in horrifying manner and always will rule war in Yugoslavia." </seg>

<seg id="1"> Those are not Warhols boxes</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> He who connects the term Sweden and wood box, does not think of Ikea, but at Andy Warhol. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Or yet? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Presently manufactured wood boxes throw dark shadows in Sweden on Warhols work index. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Forgeries are a large part of the ninety-four Brillo-boxes listed there by the "type Stockholm". </seg>
<seg id="6"> After the Swedish newspaper stirred up "expresses" some months ago doubt about the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo-boxes of the year 1968, internal investigations in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm conclude now sobering: The six "Brillo-boxes", that the former museum director Pontus Hultén left as a donation to the Moderna Museet 1995, are copies - and well also the large part of the approximately hundred further Brillo boxes of that "type Stockholm" that are on the international art market in circulation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The prehistory is interlocks, a confusing concatenation more artistic and kuratorischer productions. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Created Warhol in New York 1964 its first "Brillo-boxes", painted wood boxes, that are based "Brillo" on the red-blue-white design of the carton of the soap powder. </seg>
<seg id="9"> A display of its work in the Moderna Museet 1968 issued - with Warhols agreement - hundreds of Brillo-boxes out of cardboard: These did not come (from costs reason) of Warhol, but rather were delivered directly out of the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It did not concern works of art, but rather around its examples, around bare display items. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Simultaneously Warhol 1968 gave probably the permission let produce some few Brillo-Holzkisten in Sweden, that were not issued to be sure in the Moderna Museet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Time witness speak now about approximately fifteen boxes, that at that time as authorized Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the label "type Stockholm" to right went in into the art story and auction story. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Many an of them obtained on auction more than 100,000 dollars. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén maintained later falsely, 1968 approximately hundred wood boxes in Sweden had been produced and issued, leave would have the Warhol then to it. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Actually Hulténs were produced 105 boxes first 1990 in Malmö for a display in St. Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At this time Warhol was already three years dead. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Lars Byström, boss curator at the Moderna Museet, examined also three next to the six museum own Brillo-boxes out of Swedish private possession, of which two 1968 in Stockholm were prepared: Your press chip disk became first grundiert and sanded, was applied after that white oil paint with a brush. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The structure of the copies from the year 1990 on the other hand does not betray that the color with a painter roll was applied without undercoat directly on the press chip disk - moreover concerns it oil paint, but rather around Acrylfarbe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Be not reported "these boxes became of the artist authorizes and should of the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-boxes removes become", lets the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, : "If the 'Andy Warhol type Authentication Board' in New York not to one other end comes, becomes the Moderna Museet the six boxes in its collection as copies/display material classify." </seg>
<seg id="20"> Already in July to be sure the Authentication Board announced to investigate the "heavy accusations", that are raised in things of the soap powder-boxes. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Yet since then one wraps himself there into inexorable being quiet. </seg>
