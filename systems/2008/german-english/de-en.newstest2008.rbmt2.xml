<seg id="1">  Food at a European inflation </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  The food prices increasing rapidly are main reason for the increase measured in the euro zone in the inflation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">  The price increase was in the 13 countries of the euro zone more highly than expected in November -- after the 2.6 per cent in October an annual rate of inflation of 3.1 per cent was registered as the statistical office of the EU reports in Luxembourg. </seg>
<seg id="4">  Bloomberg reported official forecasts have started out from only 3 per cent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">  Unlike the American, British and Canadian central bank the European Central Bank (ECB) hasn't lowered the Leitzsins. In your estimation the cut in interest rates would become the increasing commodity prices of and the slight fall in unemployment favor the emergence of an inflationary spiral. </seg>
<seg id="6">  The ECB endeavors to keep the rate of inflation pressed for the two per cent brand less than two per cent or at least. </seg>
<seg id="7">  The ECB is according to an analyst in the doublemill: One must "arrange" the inflation to exclude later need for action. </seg>
<seg id="8">  With 3.3 per cent the rate of inflation achieved a twelve annual record high in Germany in November; the rate of 3.6 to 4.1 per cent climbed in Spain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">  The increased food and prices of energy are responsible for the increase in the inflation in the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="10">  The MATIF wheat listings increased by 88 per cent and the course for soybeans also achieved a record high since 1973. </seg>
<seg id="11">  There was a considerable price increase in 2007. also at edible oil and dairy products </seg>
<seg id="12">  The world market price for crude oil increased by 52 per cent this year -- last month the price per barrel of the black gold reached almost 100 U.S. dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">  According to the ECB the inflation will increase 2008 from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in the year, one expects a fall on 1.9 per cent in 2009, though. </seg>
<seg id="14">  For the next 3-4 months analysts start out from a 3 per cent rate of inflation, however, estimate the annual average rate with 2.1 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="15">  For 2008 experts expect that the ECB will lower the interest twice. </seg>

<seg id="1">  Gallup locates to governmental crisis </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  After stagnating for a long time the number of the Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably by the beginning of December. The party has the biggest base camp, lasting the consent first time since 2002 dagewesenen low of 13 per cent has one never reached for the socialists according to the Gallup. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">  With the party faithful voters the difference turns out clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: More than two thirds (71 per cent) contrast with a fifth (20 per cent) consent for the MSZP. </seg>
<seg id="4">  MDF and SZDSZ lie according to the survey under the parliamentary entry hurdle: You come up to two per cent in the total population. </seg>
<seg id="5">  The number of party voters has grown by a per cent in the two stores. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">  In comparison with the last low the general economic atmosphere has further deteriorated, the share of the ones who judge the economic situation of the country when "really bad", so high (41 per cent), was never before while another 46 per cent regards it as "rather bad". </seg>
<seg id="7">  After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer the families see the change of their financial situation more pessimistically once more. </seg>
<seg id="8">  For the next year the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth starts out from a recovery. </seg>
<seg id="9">  A Gallup survey carried out in December yielded, that the work of the prime minister as " rather bad when right " 71% of the people asked, a historical high, judged. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">  Thirteen per cent of the people asked have great confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány during which share of the supporters makes up 38 per cent for Viktor Orbán. </seg>
<seg id="11">  About 54% don't trust the head of the government at all, compared with 27% distrust against the party leader of the Fidesz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">  One of the indicators of the political atmosphere is the number of the ones who think one could get a grip on the dissatisfaction with the governor also without changes of government. </seg>
<seg id="13">  Today, if 35% still had voiced in favor of the whereabouts of the government and the head of the government after the disturbances in last October, this share amounts on only still 20%, while the relative majority (33 per cent) sees the solution only in new elections. </seg>
<seg id="14">  Asked after her interest in the plebiscite 60 per cent answered that it participates "certainly" and another 20% "probably" would hand in their vote. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">  For comparison purposes: if the parliamentary elections would take place on this Sunday, only 55 per cent would go "certainly" to the urns, another 15% regard their participation as "probable". In view of these trends the result of the plebiscite would be foreseeable. </seg>
<seg id="16">  74% would vote against the hospital day money against the studies charges, 79% against the practice charges, and 84%. </seg>

<seg id="1">  Auchan at the most expensive one, Tesco increased around almost a fifth </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  The Hypermarkets in the Budaörser trade area also have this year keeps the average price increase of 16% of the last year with the difference that no rise of the value added tax gave it this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">  Article from Napi Gazdaság </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">  In the Budaörser trade triangle the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" of also this year by 16 per cent has increased, price increases were registered by over 1,000 hooves into all Hypermärkten, though. </seg>
<seg id="5">  After the prices have "galloped from it" in the food markets in last December, the price increase prozentuell hasn't turned out drastic, compared with the anyway high, earlier baseline. </seg>
<seg id="6">  It seems certainly deterrent to the consumers, though, that hoof isn't even this year for what they had paid hoof last year still far under 9,000 available for 10,000. </seg>
<seg id="7">  The price of the "Napi" shopping basket exceeded the magical 10,000 hoof limit hoof in the examined markets by at least 91. </seg>
<seg id="8">  The highest price amounted hoof to 10,573. </seg>
<seg id="9">  The price at 6,800 was (hoof) in 6800. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">  The prices remained almost on last year's level for Unicum and live fish, the prices for turkey breast pieces of tenderloin, nut and poppy, have increased strongly, however. </seg>
<seg id="11">  Prices for flour and bread corresponded, the head offices of statistical office of Hungary to the data there was 1 kg of bread morning call for 139 Forint at Auchan, however. </seg>
<seg id="12">  There wasn't any competition conditional sudden fall in price at the product on under 200 Forint. </seg>
<seg id="13">  The price of a two liters Coca-Cola returnable bottle of under 200 Forint was here, also surprising the drink therefore cost inclusive pledge only 257 hoof. </seg>
<seg id="14">  This year in the "Napi" shopping basket comparison Auchan at the most expensive one and Cora at the most favorable one nevertheless came off. </seg>
<seg id="15">  Our calculations have arisen that have Cora, increased by 18 per cent during Tesco and Auchan respectively the prices in the "Napi" shopping basket opposite the Christmas prices last year at 15. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">  The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the this year's year was 12% the rise between the cheapest shopping basket of the last year, lasting and expensive the current year 21% turned off. </seg>
<seg id="17">  The average rise in prices was 1,480.00 hoof. </seg>
<seg id="18">  The average price increase was at 1,206.00 Forint in the previous year still, the added value tax increase manifested itself at the prices at last Christmas, though. </seg>
<seg id="19">  Exactly this process has affected the trade terribly: The department stores apparently couldn't decide so properly which price margin they shall use at the individual articles since the effects of the price increase on the consumerism were unforeseeable. </seg>
<seg id="20">  (If the dealer plans the circulation speed of a product badly, he can fall around essential profits in the price margin which goes by the traffic intensity.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">  The price increase of the "Napi" shopping basket turned out Mehwertsteuer conditional so radically last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint whereas the price difference was merely 844 Forint at the cheapest basket. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">  Such extremes weren't watched since the most expensive basket cost around 1,630.00 Forint more than in the previous year and this year there was a rise in prices of 1,284.00 Forint even at the cheapest one. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">  Showed itself a disastrous price increase in the comparison of the two last Christmas seasons, the price of the daily consumption articles into the Hypermärkten has increased into less than 20 months around more as 30 per cent. </seg>
<seg id="24">  (In turn this doesn't confirm this one the head offices of statistical office of Hungary absolutely to data: The statistical office stated one more than a 30 per cent price increase at some basic foodstuffs in the period of 12 months. </seg>
<seg id="25">  Next to flour also at eggs so approximately). </seg>
<seg id="26">  If one takes, however, a look into the "Napi" shopping basket, this almost seems at the latter by no means, there the price level the has risen even in the worst case around hardly more than 10 per cent already in the previous year of expensive product. </seg>
<seg id="27">  Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten -- after all, they could pass the drastic price increase on to the multinationals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">  The Hypermärkte don't complain in the golden trade triangle; It is reported constantly of good years. </seg>
<seg id="29">  Our experience shows that the majority of the customers doesn't look on the prices in the three department stores any more. </seg>
<seg id="30">  Large quantities are bought from everything, durable food goes in pallets over the shop counters. </seg>
<seg id="31">  There were endless snakes in all three department stores at the Kassa Wednesday morning when the number of the customers suddenly exploded. </seg>
<seg id="32">  Is of, though, a lower customer frequency reports to the country so that many multinationals complain to the pollsters they couldn't reach once the planned sales volume and to be more precise not only at food but also at lasting consumer goods. </seg>

<seg id="1">  Disinfectants in many places are saved up for </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  This year more than one thousand infections were registered in hospitals which could be explained by improper dealing with antibiotics. </seg>
<seg id="3">  The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the over-load of the staff, aren't good at all everything for checking the infections -- factors, these, so the leading woman doctor of the national epidemiology center. </seg>
<seg id="4">  In many places you economize also at the disinfectants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">  A MRSA infection was diagnosed in the Traumatologie department of the János hospital recently. </seg>
<seg id="6">  The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was admitted to the hospital after a serious accident. </seg>
<seg id="7">  The patient was isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">  At the beginning of the year there already was a similar infection. </seg>
<seg id="9">  The injured of a serious car accident was the man had dismissed, little to return with a MRSA infection out of the hospital later, though. Since then, an important operation couldn't be carried out yet because of the bacterium which still is in the body of the patient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">  Until December 10th this year infections triggered out of hospitals 1094 by multi-resistant pathogenes were reported to the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system, so the leading woman doctor of the national epidemiology center, Karolina Böröcz. </seg>
<seg id="11">  So so many infections triggered by multi-resistant pathogenes were registered certainly in the hospitals, however, the number of unrecorded cases might be higher. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">  About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to Methicillin-Oxacillin. </seg>
<seg id="13">  The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carry approximately a third of the people in its nose without it wanting to cause an illness. </seg>
<seg id="14">  SA conditional infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) usually react to antibiotics well, they are curable well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">  If the means are measured out too highly or used improperly, though, arises from the good respondierenden bacteria antibiotics resistant, which spreads fast under corresponding conditions in the hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="16">  Immune system which is particularly with patients weakened or working badly durably, or these bacteria can patients with a low weight cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood-poisoning, that is sepsis, but also into old. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  According to the medical head of the János hospital the MRSA infection is nothing special, such occurrences are part of sick person house everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="18">  One mustn't mistake the infection for the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi -- there is not MRSA only there where it isn't looked for. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">  Resistant to antibiotics </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">  Such patients are ", isolated this nursing staff wears rubber gloves and masks at the supply and we dispose of the antibiotics necessary for the treatment " -- so Tibor Nyulasi. </seg>
<seg id="21">  At their admission to the hospital the patients are examined for MRSA, an infection cannot nevertheless always be avoided. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">  Samplings too rare </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">  The majority of the infections in hospitals triggered by MRSA would be avoidable, the conditions ruling at present and circumstances are unfavorable for the checking of the origin or the spreading of the multi-resistant pathogene, though, Karolina Böröcz says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">  After this infection happens predominant in hospitals and old people's homes the Spitäler should examine the delivered patients and MRSA immediately infected isolate. </seg>
<seg id="25">  The microbiological sampling is not so frequently practiced, however, in the Hungarian hospitals. </seg>
<seg id="26">  Not least because there aren't any subsidies for this examination on the part of the state health insurance company. </seg>
<seg id="27">  Most cases would come only then to the daylight, if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, so the medical leader of the epidemiology center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">  On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations for the corresponding application of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there, however, are guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes also in Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="29">  Antibiotic therapies shall be purposefully, this means microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the means can form, this directive isn't always observed by hospitals either, though. </seg>
<seg id="30">  Microbiological samplings are even still more seldom the basic support of situated patient, so Karolina Böröcz, under the itinerant ones, or himself in. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">  You economize at the disinfectants </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">  A scientific proof proves that MRSA from a patient is most frequently assigned to the other ones by the nursing staff. </seg>
<seg id="33">  The Händewaschen or wearing gloves and masks just therefore are of a great importance, there also are considerable defects in the hospitals in this field, though. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">  MRSA is transferred by droplet infection or contact, however, there isn't always the possibility in the local hospitals of isolating the infected patient. </seg>
<seg id="35">  The rooms are even often overcrowded although meter should a distance of at least 1.5 it give between them from the epidemiological view, the beds strung pressedly for each other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">  Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz further says it even happens there are few male nurses, many patients, in the hospitals supplied financially less well that everything is economized at disinfectants -- factors which virtually favor the emergence of infections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">  Such infections are provably far less frequent there or the further distribution of the pathogene can be held back where these protective measures are adhered to, so Karolina Böröcz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">  Government program against MRSA </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">  Health insurances cause this one enormous costs, to get a grip on MRSA infections they are therefore fought everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="40">  The prevention of MRSA or its checking was held tight in the government program in England for example. </seg>
<seg id="41">  According to first symptoms is the program successfully -- as published data verifies, is declining in England the trend of the MRSA infections. </seg>
<seg id="42">  The European center for illness prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the origin of multi-resistant pathogenes also MRSA (under this), as well as the prevention declared one of its priorities by infections in hospitals. </seg>

<seg id="11">  The secretary declared the EU will reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 20% to 2020 (measured against the values of 1990) independently of whether the "agreement after 2012" is obtained successfully or not. The union would be even ready to support a 30 per cent diminution other great industrial nations of the world or developing countries are also ready to meet their liabilities after strengths and responsible, soferne. </seg>
<seg id="12">  Gábor Fodor emphasized that the target of the states which had joined the Kyoto protocol in 1997, a diminution from merely 5.2 per cent, was whereas, at that time, the EU had already itself committed 15 member states to doing a minus of 8% with hers. </seg>
<seg id="13">  Diminution of the greenhouse gas emissions by 6% in comparison with the years 1985-87, a specification which will absolutely fulfill the country as the specification has to be looked up in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment, is for Hungary. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="14">  Use is high in Bali -- after all, the long-dated international climate political agreement must be ready within two years, it would otherwise become effective certainly first after 2012. In this case no renewed, international emission reduction system would follow the diminution plans fixed in the Kyoto protocol, the meaning also has stressed the IPCC, the scientific climate change committee which is international and awarded the Nobel peace prize for UNO in its latest report. </seg>

<seg id="1">  Political Capital: A Hungarian guard increases state risk </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  In opinion of the department of risk analysis (Risk Analysing division) of Political Capital the activities of the Hungarian guard founded in this August with support "of the movement for a better Hungary" have the risk of Hungary and raised the region in more regard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">  Among other things it is called in the "Risikowarnungs report" of the institute: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk puts this one increase the ethnic tensions between the gypsy and not gypsy population already existing in Hungary ", which could lead to violent ethnic discussions even at short notice ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">  Main reason for it is the strategy of the Hungarian guard which presumably aims at the provocation of such a discussion, so the research institute. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">  As reported this as an omission is on the part of this one seen in persons responsible politically: "Persons of the public life have left the discussion of the Romany question to representatives of radical political groupings, on the Romany Hungary contrast these have built up their political strategy now". </seg>
<seg id="6">  One suspects that this would intensify the problem, make the sensible dialog impossible, favor extremities as well as increase the probability of violent discussions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">  The Forschungsinsitut means ausserdem not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the local and foreign media which would have activities of the Hungarian guard, " the picture of Hungary damaged abroad considerably, what particularly concerns the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity ". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">  We remember: Since fall 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups has been continuous in Hungary in the upswing so that calling organizations were founded several, himself "national self-defense organization" since summer 2007. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">  They have these groupings in common ", that himself their members respectively define as a civilian organization open while they are boasting openly -- armed from time to time -- defense tasks under reference to the unfitness of the police of preparing (disaster controling, national defense, Ordnungshütung), the army or the state itself, ", they was said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">  And: All this happens in accordance with that method which tries to disguise endeavors as a civil initiative which are been different and being based on the politics and party unwillingness of the population, political. </seg>
<seg id="11">  So the emphasis of the civilian character and the organization form don't merely serve the avoidance of legal hurdles which could appear in the course of the entry for court, it is a political strategy at the same time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">  As has to be taken from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk increasing factor also for the relations with the neighboring states. </seg>
<seg id="13">  "Within the last months the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighboring states as a potential source of danger, many an extremist nationalistic politician of certain neighboring countries sees the confirmation of his own anti Hungary policy so in the emergence of the Hungarian guard. </seg>
<seg id="14">  All this has effects on the political stability of the region " -- it was said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">  From the view of the research institute the foundation of the Hungarian guard isn't an individual phenomenon in central east Europe, the political risk therefore has grown for the complete region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">  As reported, the activities of the Hungarian guard are comparable with those of the Bulgarian National Guard whose foundation you announced in August 2007 of the radically right-wing Bulgarian national union (BNU). </seg>
<seg id="17">  The Romany mass riots which have taken place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana) were in the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian guard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">  At once, the BNU has taken the occurrences for the foundation of the National Guard as an opportunity with the argument that the aim of the organization is the "national protection". </seg>
<seg id="19">  In your opinion a real "gypsy terror" was namely noticeable in Bulgaria within the last 17 years, Political Capital remained the state, however, idly and indifferent -- so. </seg>
<seg id="20">  And: The initiative would have lot kicked an intense debate in the Bulgarian public. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">  As said the increased risk for ethnic discussions is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Romany organizations have announced to found their own guard for resistance purposes. </seg>
<seg id="22">  The Hungarian Romany shows the Bulgarian National Guard the Hungarian guard's till now many similarities to these, the activities doesn't have to be excluded since that also, reacts with organizing their own protection to the threats, is called in the risk warning report of Political Capital it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">  Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital said on enquiry from the message office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute. </seg>
<seg id="24">  Risk analysis reports would be published, and should it be recognizable for risk changing trends, is informed the public opinion every year like in the case by the publication of the risk warning report. </seg>

<seg id="1">  Special days aren't holidays everywhere </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  In Hungary holidays are regulated legally exactly so that the practice of changing on the working days has established itself around the holidays by now, the next year grants us less such days, though. </seg>
<seg id="3">  One understands something else also in the EU and in America by "holiday". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">  The Hungarian right handed system distinguishes between national holidays and days work off. </seg>
<seg id="5">  Days work open are church holidays mostly or are with important historical events in connection. </seg>
<seg id="6">  We also celebrate for example New Year: Both the last day the old and, the first day of the new year, are days work off already -- the latter be able to the New Year's Eve revelers rest alone with that. </seg>
<seg id="7">  In the whole year we have altogether fourteen holidays. </seg>
<seg id="8">  The national holidays are March 15th which reminds of the revolution of 1848 and October 23rd, the commemoration day of the revolution of 1956. </seg>
<seg id="9">  On August 20th the state foundation is us our dead bodies on May 1st the work celebratedly, on November 1st and 2nd remember. </seg>
<seg id="10">  Furthermore there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">  Since our state, National or religious holidays seldom fall for a weekend, the practice of the "working day moving" has proved itself in the cases in which we would work before or after the holiday only a day. </seg>
<seg id="12">  It is the price of the extended weekends, though, that we must work very well or go to school on the Saturdays in front of that. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">  When this day this one fells the holiday, you shall work off at long last, the Labor Secretary is fixing for long years in an ordinance of his own, in front of or after. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">  The legal provision applies to all employers and recipients, for public employees and officials of the public service similarly. </seg>
<seg id="15">  Only companies and facilities in which the business is continued without interruption that is also on the holidays are excepted. </seg>
<seg id="16">  This year the statement of conditions of employment is only mixed up a little by the holidays at the end of the year: As of December 24th stops in this country really stand since most take vacation lifted especially for it for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve time compensation or this one. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  Next year more holidays fall to the week middle or until the end of the week so that will give at the working days less Umdisponierungen as this year. </seg>
<seg id="18">  The calendar will around the day of the work "on the head provided", with that be able to stay at home the people at once first for four days of the piece. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">  April 26th becomes a working day Saturday, this one so that the Friday, May 2nd can be a rest-day. </seg>
<seg id="20">  The second Umdisponierung is connected with the holiday on October 23rd: One will have to work off the Friday, Octobers 24th first of all on Saturday, October 18th. </seg>
<seg id="21">  The end of the year will completely be dominated by the holidays after everything is left and stops as of December 24th even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday, though. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  E-mails which we forget to send, language news which we never receive -- harmless lies which we don't notice any more: You take "color" at work to the weekday. </seg>
<seg id="3">  The question is, whether one himself to mere one used, or what puts this small trouble for himself consciously of the challenge and temptedly this misunderstandable, aggravating for other situations to vermweiden better. </seg>
<seg id="4">  Tips. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">  "Sorry, I have forgotten to pass on to you that somebody of the marketing department has called" -- a colleague says. </seg>
<seg id="6">  That one has missed a meeting through this? </seg>
<seg id="7">  At best one is sorry for and tries to line it up to make up by perhaps calling with the marketing department and confessing remorsefully one would have forgotten for the message (this is the less usual method). </seg>
<seg id="8">  The thing is dismissed with an excuse mostly. </seg>
<seg id="9">  With what can and try to avoid these situations consciously one prepare moments really unpleasant his colleagues before one becomes entangled in embarrassing excuses, if one should think it over? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">  What doesn't to one belong himself, lent something? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">  There is hardly something more sinewy as if one reaches for a document, office accessories or the telephone but it isn't here. </seg>
<seg id="12">  The stapler lay on the desk still yesterday -- is it gone this morning? </seg>
<seg id="13">  Or is approximately the ballpoint pen believed lost discovered on the desk of a colleague? </seg>
<seg id="14">  One should borrow nothing from the colleagues without wonder because annoys they are if they notice that something has got away. </seg>
<seg id="15">  So not putting any envelope or mail its from the office into the bag because they could meet one: no-one more there, if one needs it urgently anyway. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">  Gossip about the private life of the colleagues? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  There is not to hold back any effective means, a gossip which was already put into the world. </seg>
<seg id="18">  Who with whom, what done? </seg>
<seg id="19">  Where and why? </seg>
<seg id="20">  The information (or assumptions) shouldn't one everybody about the private life of the colleagues if possible tie to the nose! </seg>
<seg id="21">  And if somebody opens anyway and his innermost secret betrays us, we shouldn't abuse this confidence! </seg>
<seg id="22">  One is silent like a grave instead of, at all, not passing on this one to persons present even if others know also about the problems of the colleague at the best. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">  Reported without reason illy? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">  If one calls in the office to report under reference to tormenting headaches illy because one just feels unwell or simply only would like to rest, one should himself about one be in the clear one: The colleagues must finish the work of their own, nondeferrable handlings, projects with firm appointments instead of one now themselves. </seg>
<seg id="25">  Join in in the colleagues therefore not bad! </seg>
<seg id="26">  One knows already on the day before that one won't make it to the office the next day or that something could come between, why one must have left at home, if one should report it on time, so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are confronted with the absence unexpectedly if. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">  Gesumme, giggling, make a telephone call </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">  One is just deepened in his work, however, is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggling of the colleagues? </seg>
<seg id="29">  Listened in unintentionally on a telephone call which one wouldn't have been supposed to hear better? </seg>
<seg id="30">  One shouldn't irritate the colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which one holds away over their heads), trampling, getting angry constantly or grumbling. </seg>
<seg id="31">  All this can be very disturbing even if are not just in a task (write she plan, organize) recessed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">  Are the others always to blame? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">  If a project isn't ready in due time, one has an important letter or important Nachrichte forget to send off, one shouldn't look for the fault of the forgetfulness of one's own at other! </seg>
<seg id="34">  If possible one shouldn't finish himself speaking on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues! </seg>
<seg id="35">  One admits his faults to himself and apologizes best if others also were concerned by it! </seg>
<seg id="36">  Can make up the question like one mistakes make up for it or this, you attach only too missed! </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the regular morning jam. </seg>
<seg id="3">  A strange melody resounds from the radio: The sound of a violin mated with electronic stock exchange securities. </seg>
<seg id="4">  I turn the volume more highly. </seg>
<seg id="5">  The speed changes, a female choir the bass comes to the previous sounds and as a real sound jewel. </seg>
<seg id="6">  It is the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar which resounds on mr2. </seg>
<seg id="7">  The local music scene hasn't spoiled us with qualitative Electropop long time at all. </seg>
<seg id="8">  One sees even the jam but now differently if one hears the new album of Zagar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">  The garage skirt with its Gitarrengequitsche contributes a new and exciting production from the local digital Underground scene slowly the seem, and even if again "into" is, which proves local Electropop of Yonderboi, so some to a change of the overall picture: There is something new under the sun. </seg>
<seg id="10">  Balázs Zságer it has begun in Pécs, played instruments even in the band Yonderboi before perhaps because a pub doesn't stand two pipers -- started with its own way to follow. </seg>
<seg id="11">  He made the breakthrough with its project (Zagar) and its music which merges elements from jazz, electronic and pop but had approached only as one with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film to him (e.g. </seg>
<seg id="12">  "Szezon" of Ferenc Török). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">  The formation which at first had appeared in smaller clubs became under only known to the wider audience, as the magazine "wan2" the its first album from the year 2002 top strung 50 local albs and Zagar chose a marketable trendsetter together with Yonderboi to the almost only one also in the west. </seg>
<seg id="14">  Zagar and his band undoubtedly were "trendy", however, no-one was interested in knowing whether they also like to bear this brand. </seg>
<seg id="15">  The band has reacted as it should: With a new, even better album. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">  The new album with the title having been published now tumble Fly Instead " Cannot " could open up ways new to them, the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years, though. </seg>
<seg id="17">  The expression originates namely from the time when Balázs Zságer was still away with another band. </seg>
<seg id="18">  The airy, flying allusion would be also all right louder guitar, the influences, these fall besides the ethereal character of the music, though the rock 'n' roll open, corresponding to the Zeitgeist and the trends. </seg>
<seg id="19">  With these songs the singer living in England and working with the band "The jigsaw puzzle", György Ligeti, has introduced himself to the premiere in the Millenáris. </seg>
<seg id="20">  A song of the album has created it even for the radio pop song -- since latest of early till late pop music sending to it mr2 Petofi has gradually set the listeners the earwig with the number "Wings of Love" which was taken by six local singers ("Underground stars") under cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="21">  Everything OK so? </seg>
<seg id="22">  The hvg.hu has enquired at Balázs Zságer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">  hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far is your music reserved for a certain layer? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">  Balázs Zságer: The concept "layer music" doesn't mean much to me at all. </seg>
<seg id="25">  In my opinion gives two castes in the pop music and to be more precise not Mainstream and Underground or alternative and pop but commercial and honest. </seg>
<seg id="26">  Alone the so-called alternative or Underground music can be shallow and meaningless, be able to do her but be produced also only for the sale which makes her to commercial music just the same. </seg>
<seg id="27">  A good pop number also can arise from an honest motive. </seg>
<seg id="28">  The receptiveness of the listener works independently of languages and national boundaries also according to this principle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">  hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign audience opposite your music? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">  B. Zs. The pop music has particularly a greater tradition west of us abroad. </seg>
<seg id="31">  Only teenagers or persons in the twenties don't go to concerts but also the older audience there. </seg>
<seg id="32">  You follow up the trends in the pop music much more attentively which happen around it because they also regard it as a part of the contemporary culture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">  hvg.hu: Which role befits the audience at your work? </seg>
<seg id="34">  Is it, important whom, where, how many listen to your music? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">  B. Zs. Of course it is a good feeling to see that more always come to our concerts. </seg>
<seg id="36">  However, we have never composed for the market. </seg>
<seg id="37">  With us the music doesn't arise to serve a purpose but for a certain reason. </seg>
<seg id="38">  The role of the audience is noticeable at the concerts mostly where there already is a mutual interaction but in turn there is this one only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment. </seg>
<seg id="39">  I have nevertheless noticed one: If you want to make it to everyone right, you are no longer interesting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">  hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi? </seg>
<seg id="41">  It is away as a soloist and its career rather has built up in the west. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">  B. Zs. We don't really go its way that one again and again tempted, this in our music hineinzuinterpretieren, completely except for it. </seg>
<seg id="43">  We see each other sooner than team player, which on the musical presence of the different one let trust and it develop. </seg>
<seg id="44">  At first comparisons of our work with it of Yonderboi were unavoidable of course since several get from us from its band and have taken another way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">  hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petofi suits "Wings of Love" in first place. </seg>
<seg id="46">  Many have belonged to the names Zagar only in connection with this number. </seg>
<seg id="47">  Was the opening staged with an a little more popular style in the direction of conscious of a wider audience? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">  B. Zs. We didn't have any plans to write a hit which then shall suffer for the album as a carthorse. </seg>
<seg id="49">  In this song it is all about more. </seg>
<seg id="50">  It was thought as a final of the album with which we wanted to resolve the sound orgy and the a little more difficult topics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">  hvg.hu: How have you selected the six singers? </seg>
<seg id="52">  What was the conducting principle why exactly her? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">  B. Zs. It was the basic idea to make a gospel song like choir. </seg>
<seg id="54">  The idea of arranging the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene then came. </seg>
<seg id="55">  So Edina Kutzora is Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Eniko Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh the choir of six come into being, therefore Sena, , which then we have christened apäter "Underground stars". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">  hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song just the same or has it co-formed the girls? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">  B. Zs. There already was the number in the instrumental version longer but when the material was ready for the album, we imagined that this number still "needs something." </seg>
<seg id="58">  The Akkordenabfolge has really asked for a song voice. </seg>
<seg id="59">  I still have one sung the melody in the same night, she has learned the girls later. </seg>
<seg id="60">  Everything came practically onto straight off and alarming spontaneously. </seg>
<seg id="61">  I can remember, I was electrified quite at that time but it also has already required the "stars". </seg>
<seg id="62">  The song would alone with my voice never have got so firm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">  hvg.hu: However, one had the impression both on the plate and at the concert the girls would be in the background. </seg>
<seg id="64">  There isn't any solo share (except for the short solo of Judy Jay), they don't have a role of their own, their song sings completely together and isn't louder than the music therefore isn't only accompanied by the music. </seg>
<seg id="65">  They stood behind also on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="66">  Is it intention? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">  B.Zs. It was that way because of purely technical problems that they have stood behind. </seg>
<seg id="68">  We didn't want to send them solo roles consciously, though. </seg>
<seg id="69">  In the number it also is all about that these determined grand pianos, the grand pianos of the love emporheben, us that where who shall from forget his ego a little come, forgotten, and where is away, we simply allow one. </seg>
<seg id="70">  I would like that others also feel this euphoric condition which we have felt when the song has arisen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">  hvg.hu: Which one was the most effortful song? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72">  B. Zs. Actually the musical Schaffensarbeit rather has none at all, it at given more difficult tasks when mixing. </seg>
<seg id="73">  Longer, where the groove didn't want " rock 'n' roll Goes To, The girls, " to work for example at "Dorian Gray's dilemma" in which I play on a concert piano or at, but after and after everything has joined himself together as in the case of a jigsaw puzzle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">  hvg.hu: Which one is your favorite number of the new album? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">  B. Zs. This changes with the concerts constantly and also now where I have the album "losgelasssen". </seg>
<seg id="76">  At present, it is "prophet Is A Fool" escape From Never, " The Earth "and the number" The seed ". </seg>

<seg id="1">  Budget is through </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  Yes, it is done. </seg>
<seg id="3">  The national budget is approved. </seg>
<seg id="4">  What is special at this household? </seg>
<seg id="5">  It is the first household which this government has designed and which was accepted by the coalition majority without support of the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="6">  This one for the current year still was approved with support of the CSSD (social democrats) because secretary Sobotka had him presented (of this party) and the CSSD couldn't permit itself therefore to decline him. </seg>
<seg id="7">  As opposed to the lively debate before the coordination on the motion of 'no confidence' against the government nothing dramatic happened this time. </seg>
<seg id="8">  The parliament approved this traditionally little observed, nevertheless most meaningful law at due leisure. </seg>
<seg id="9">  This is so to speak paradoxical. </seg>
<seg id="10">  Rules over everything starts and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the household whether one likes this or not. </seg>
<seg id="11">  The household is an essential component of the politics, however, is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="12">  This is a more grateful topic for the media and therefore they pay more attention to him. </seg>
<seg id="13">  A quarrel under politicians is much more interesting than bare numbers for the public. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">  The national budgets suffered at the former social-democratic governments from three weak points which the household cannot remove suddenly for the year 2008: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">  The first is, of the high share of expenditure this one is obliging because of law in which it the pensions isn't only but also around social expenditure which the "silent" coalition has concluded of CSSD and KSCM (Communists) last year before the elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">  The second is the budgetary policy in deficit as a result of the first weak point. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  The third restriction consists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">  The greatest risk, however, isn't the state budget deficit. </seg>
<seg id="19">  This household is public and one javelin measures under control. </seg>
<seg id="20">  However, a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities. </seg>
<seg id="21">  Many mayors often distributed rashly to develop further sources apart from takings from taxes, taxes and bank loans for investments debentures by which they were responsible for their city halls in excess. </seg>
<seg id="22">  Within the last few years they managed to pay these debts off by sale of shares of the energy and different one supply grids which had got them in the train of the privatization from the state on a massive scale. </seg>
<seg id="23">  This source has already dried up now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">  As far as we only hold on to official and verifiable facts, we notice that: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">  our economy already for some years, like the rest of the world, a growth phase passes,  without the CSSD this one refrain himself boasts. </seg>
<seg id="26">  This represented a single opportunity for her governments, to fix the public finances. </seg>
<seg id="27">  These governments were, however, still more responsible for the state instead. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">  Other countries, except for a couple of exceptions like Hungary Albania, Pakistan or Egypt have economized much more sensibly than our republic. </seg>
<seg id="29">  This is a giant disgrace which has to be ascribed to the former governments mainly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">  We belong to the countries which are threatened by poverty least, seen in the global scale. </seg>
<seg id="31">  Therefore no nassiven social programs which unfortunately were inflated quite superfluously in a gigantic extent just within the last few years are necessary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">  Even if it has turned out well to cut a part of the nonsensical populistic expenditure which was adopted this year before the elections is clear that if it doesn't come to a moving of the pension admission age and to a reform of pensions in the near future, any politics then ends practically in this country and, who is identically on the power, will it have nothing as managing purely. </seg>
<seg id="33">  It is exaggerated only easily if one says that ruling politicians then turn into officials who mechanically divide the largest portion of the tax revenue up on pensions and social expenditure. </seg>
<seg id="34">  Therefore this year's household cannot be a revolution but can put a stop to only the superseding of normal expenditure by duty expenditure. </seg>
<seg id="35">  The deficit provided for 2008 of 70 billion crowns definitely wouldn't be governments superfluously, if earlier would have distributed, what went only within the last ten years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">  If we don't want that it really comes to that, that ruling politicians turn into pure civil servants, then we must be patient and wish this not too strong coalition government, however, which is conscious of this one that the state can spend much only in such a way as it is able to take to taxes and charges quiet at the preparations for broader reform laws. </seg>
<seg id="37">  Only these make a gradual putting through of a balanced national budget possible. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">  Not only the structure of the meeting which of government delegates and such forms a strange mixture of not government organizations is unacceptable according to Klaus but difference between the rhetoric which accompanies it and the reality also the basic. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8">  The Czech president emphasized at the presentation of his book that the topic is very important for him and that therefore he commits himself to it so. </seg>
<seg id="9">  His satisfaction expressed also about this that his book is published in German translation because "I often meet" caricatures of my views him. </seg>
<seg id="10">  So interested parties could look up his attitude undistortedly now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">  Klaus reminded that he no-one is climatic box but he has sufficient prerequisites in his opinion to write such a book. </seg>
<seg id="12">  He is finally a graduate to understand and to judge technical treatises capably, has experience with statistics and is also an economist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">  He described the thesis as main statement of the book, that the climate permanently changes and that so its changes are normal that the effort is superfluously ineffectively and unacceptably influence the development of the climate, and that effortful no corresponding opinion admits for the global warming under the scientists that the results of the present changes are great and serious and therefore didn't represent no threat too. </seg>
<seg id="14">  Furthermore he regards to force unproved opinions upon others for unacceptable as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen he considers this a dangerous restriction of the liberty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">  On questions of persons present he explained repeated, he is not up against ", but against militant environmental activists, a sensible environmental protection which doesn't consider the relationship between effort and yield ". </seg>

<seg id="7">  Everyone just introduced himself to the words "Walachisches kingdom" these actor and comedian. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  To say the truth I was never a special fan the Peugeot 206. </seg>
<seg id="3">  Many weren't worth his handling characteristics, one could describe the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the processing as rather below average. </seg>
<seg id="4">  Now but his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market and this one is better around much. </seg>
<seg id="5">  Opinion to revise thinks the station wagon with the name SW is still a piece further and I only have left. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">  When I had tested the classic Hatchback of 207, I had to complain about the too low head liberty on the backseats for example. </seg>
<seg id="7">  These troubles exist the bodywork no more, then now the station wagon is so arranged that two meter men won't even suffer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">  Fast further </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">  I only go through the interior décor briefly to not repeat myself too much. </seg>
<seg id="10">  It is a quite excellent design where I have objections only because of the wretched middle tunnel. </seg>
<seg id="11">  I would welcome a little more designerische design there where otherwise the car makes such an elegant impression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">  The seats are comfortable and are the times past where perhaps we complained about too short seats or head-rests. </seg>
<seg id="13">  The side hold also has itself opposite this 206 fundamentally improves. </seg>
<seg id="14">  What the room supply concerns, one can feel the extended measurements of the bodywork also here. </seg>
<seg id="15">  The lack of head liberty already mentioned is also removed in the station wagon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">  Suitcase into the trunk </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  However, the main thing at this car is the cargo hold. </seg>
<seg id="18">  I must describe this one as very good (also because of the folding rear window) loading in cash and space-savingly. </seg>
<seg id="19">  The cavities are equipped with safety harnesses which represent an ideal compromise. </seg>
<seg id="20">  You don't disturb apart ache and hold also heavier objects tight be able to. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">  But we talk about the loading up volume. </seg>
<seg id="22">  Table is 428 liters loudly in the basic equipment, what is a rather average value in comparison with the competition. </seg>
<seg id="23">  Vehicle of this class, the Skoda Fabia Combi, most not sold in comparison with this in Czechia though. </seg>
<seg id="24">  The 207 compares SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we we establish if stays behind that the Peugeot around clear noticeable 52 liters. </seg>
<seg id="25">  For a foreign vacation or loading a baby carriage this value is already critical. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">  But to stress the Positiva I still must this one after folding the pillions down mention very flat cargo hold or also the very low loading up edge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">  120 hp in four rows </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">  Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with cubic capacity 1.6 liters and a performance of 88 kW. </seg>
<seg id="29">  And a 1600-Kubik engine which drives a family Hatchback should look so, said honestly. </seg>
<seg id="30">  He is quiet, has a low consumption and moves away well. </seg>
<seg id="31">  If I compare him with his counterpart at Skoda which sometimes works as if his exhaust were stopped up with a rag, then I only can be filled with enthusiasm by him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">  The price list speaks volumes </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">  The price of this car isn't traditional at all. </seg>
<seg id="34">  However, we must remember that we have tested a car equipped well with a spacious Innneren and a very good engine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">  The basic price of the car with the 1400s gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns still comes on. </seg>
<seg id="36">  With our engine it costs as of 410900 crowns what is already quite a lot. </seg>
<seg id="37">  The equipment quality of the test car beats with 80000 crowns in addition to beech once again. </seg>
<seg id="38">  We had head airbags, automatic air conditioner, automatic windshield wiper triggering, electrical window controls and and ... behind, though </seg>
<seg id="39">  So the car costs simple 531900 crowns, altogether. </seg>
<seg id="40">  One this is a crowd but you calculate once the additional equipment Fabia together and you want to arrive at a quite similar sum. </seg>
<seg id="41">  Therefore only remains the decision which brand one wants to choose. </seg>

<seg id="7">  You find this in ample measure on the islands of the caribbean. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">  Only on one the large Antilles you, however, find island still much more and Cuba is this island the great and beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="9">  In the time of the Spaniards Cuba was the bastion for the conquest of America. </seg>
<seg id="10">  It called Columbus the most beautiful place which has seen per a human eye. </seg>
<seg id="11">  Havana cigar turned a store or transit camp of treasures once which the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe. </seg>
<seg id="12">  And then the American epoch came. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="13">  The hotel Nacional completely came into being at the end of the 20th century. </seg>

<seg id="15">  Under his guests were and others </seg>
<seg id="16">  Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  Skyscrapers grew into Havana cigar, cars which belonged to the ritual symbols of the fifties of the former Jahrhundets drove over the broad boulevards. </seg>
<seg id="18">  Ernest Hemingway bought an estate for himself in San Francisco de Paula nearby Havana cigars and he had his yacht in Cojímar lie. </seg>
<seg id="19">  Stars of the show business and politicians from all of America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita Del Medio. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">  And today? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">  You also can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana cigar. </seg>
<seg id="22">  One mixes cocktails quite as required for you at the bar in the hotel Nacional. </seg>
<seg id="23">  And the cult cars of the fifties go around to Havana cigar to this day because the Schigulis imported once and Fiats have fallen apart already long ago in the salty and damp air. </seg>
<seg id="24">  One may have come down Havana cigar, particularly his oldest part, strongly, finds as many wonderful colonial sights as straight nowhere in the surroundings here. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">  Other places are just decorated, for example Trinidad. </seg>
<seg id="26">  The tourism brings money required urgently, there was green light for this development into regard on this, that. </seg>
<seg id="27">  Within the last fifteen years new hotels haven't come into being only into Havana cigar but also in Varadero at the coast of the province Holguín and also on little islands like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others. </seg>
<seg id="28">  Cuba still offers a quirk which is unique and attracts primarily railroad enthusiasts in the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">  Steam and diesel operated narrow-gauge railroads took the sugar cane of remote plantations to the sugar factories. </seg>
<seg id="30">  Your fleet of vehicles wasn't replaced over decades and one sees there funny and fully operating engines so whose contemporaries are in the museum somewhere else already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">  Destinations of the outing </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">  The majority of the visitors of Cuba doesn't leave the bedeutendendsten places out. </seg>
<seg id="33">  So one must write no longer in detail about Varadero or Havana cigar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">  It only remains to mention that a museum is located in the estate of Hemingway already mentioned whose visit the one who likes this writer shouldn't miss. </seg>
<seg id="35">  The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="36">  The luxuriant vegetation grows on chalky soil. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">  The Mogotas, lime hill and rock, rise steeply of the valley ground, the fertile ground by which also weathered rock areas of a thick vegetation are covered accumulated in their cavities. </seg>
<seg id="38">  It is this valley where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is cultivated. </seg>
<seg id="39">  In his final form you can meet him if you go to one of the cigar factories of Havana cigar. </seg>
<seg id="40">  It possibly seems also interesting to some, that the Chilean result of the television series "major Zeman" was turned there. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">  Trinidad </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">  An ancient town which was founded briefly after the Spaniards had colonized the island. </seg>
<seg id="43">  The trade brought her glory and wealth with slaves and sugar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">  The wealth embodied itself in the neat beauty of the little town. </seg>
<seg id="45">  Influences Spanish colonial architecture, strong of the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years. </seg>
<seg id="46">  Trinidad, is such a remote place that there wasn't any street yet in the fifties of the last century there which would have put the area through to the other country, lain between the sea and the Escambray mountains. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">  This insulation contributed that it remained unnoticed. </seg>
<seg id="48">  Nothing was built there but everybody was glad that he had a roof over the head, torn off from nothing also therefore. </seg>
<seg id="49">  One it more than an afternoon time has, is then worthwhile to look at interesting places in the surroundings for Trinidad if such as the beach playa Ancón or the "valley of the sugar factories". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">  In the evening one then should go La Música into the Casa de which revives after the darkness and the music isn't where silent up to the morning. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="51">  Baracoa </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">  Some completely describe this small towns as the most beautiful of the island in the east of Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="53">  This view also is surely influenced through the way there. </seg>
<seg id="54">  Both streets which lead of Guantánamo there had to and zerküftete mountains overcome and go by a landscape which is hardly touched by human interventions high. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">  UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba in its world heir list thanks to the untouched nature there. </seg>
<seg id="56">  The best chocolate is produced there, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it has arisen after the journeys of Columbus) about one hundred years and of the hill where the former castle, the present hotel tbsp Castillo, stands several table mountains can be seen which El Yunque is the best known. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">  One could write many pages over the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra-Maestra mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos over the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the Cuban patron Caridad Del Cobre about the Santeria, an African religion which the descendants of slaves confess, over all this. </seg>

<seg id="1">  Is a final annual Rally for the stock exchange still to come? Disagreement with the experts due to the U.S. mortgage crisis </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  With almost five weeks up to the annual accounts of the stock exchange the investors already rub their hands with regard to the coming final annual Rally. </seg>
<seg id="3">  The experts regarding this nevertheless cannot make any sure forecasts. </seg>
<seg id="4">  Banif thinks that?looks purely statistically, the month is usually accompanied by a positive market trend at the stock exchange Decembers </seg>
<seg id="5">  It nevertheless isn't advisable to make forecasts of statistics at short notice and only on the basis. Tensions to be taken if serious don't determine the current market event primarily then </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">  Although other experts don't approve of a such firm rise in prices within the last weeks of the year these say nevertheless that the stock exchange quotation is certainly liquidity of the market and the market participant given the of?. These invest mainly in fixed-interest funds due to the lack of safe share funds, which is concerned by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend towards productive assets strongly. </seg>
<seg id="7">  The stock exchange will therefore rather show a course trend in opinion of these experts which is rather lateral and influenced by market fluctuations, ? primarily because we cannot assess the extents of the possible fall in the interest rate of the U.S. central bank yet, an uncertainty these primarily on the increased crude oil price and to lead the danger of the increase in the rate of inflation back is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">  Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees, that with that it is a daring time to announce a forthcoming market Rally. </seg>
<seg id="9">  The chances don't stand the expert insures??, very well. </seg>
<seg id="10">  The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its maximum brand on November 8th from 15,945.7 points. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">  But all experts don't share the same negative opinion. </seg>
<seg id="12">  In opinion of Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could, the year successfully with almost 16,000 points complete because of the restructuring of the investment funds and the subsidizing of the pension register which is traditional and carried out around this time every year. </seg>
<seg id="13">  The expert nevertheless stresses that the things could develop this year a little differently; primarily due to the final annual Rally taking place already in the second December week and therefore directly after the bridge day to the day of the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="14">  In opinion of the analyst the price fluctuations wouldn't influence the market trends. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">  The previous judgements are to the market situation on an almost technical standard, in the opinion of Federico Olucha, analyst at the bench Inversis, what could lead, that a deviation of the index values could stand out soon, the extents depended on the results of the U.S. mortgage market crisis. </seg>
<seg id="16">  The analyst trusts, that on this these turn out positive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  At the choice of the values which shall advance the Ibex to new maximum amounts the analysts agree. </seg>
<seg id="18">  Solana of Intermoney declares that it is?this year the great values' turn. </seg>
<seg id="19">  The expert would count the two big banks and some property companies as one of the value winners, ? the current sector will be too expensive at the given time there. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">  Assure Federico Olucha of the bench Inversis meanwhile that the increases in connection with the bank and industry sector will walk along. </seg>
<seg id="21">  If the Rally actually happens, the property companies will profit from it. </seg>
<seg id="22">  The ACS was on on fetching course within the last months and we hope that other property companies like Ferrovial and FCC take the same way?, so the expert. </seg>
<seg id="23">  Periodical consumption will determine the market event with regard to the increased consumerism during the Christmas Days in the last half year. </seg>
<seg id="24">  On the other hand the expert thinks that the technologies also will achieve positive sales results even if they are represented on the Spanish market only in a low number. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">  Five times within seven years </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">  Within the last seven years December showed sinking developments of course only in two cases. </seg>
<seg id="27">  When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and this one initiated a last real final annual rally simultaneously till now. </seg>
<seg id="28">  December showed a rise in prices of 6.68% this year in which the Ibex 35 made up time by 28.17 percentage points. </seg>
<seg id="29">  2008 in consequence becomes the fifth profitable year the Ibex (has) increased by 8.36% since January and can produce an Endjahresrally also, will let itself be seen whether. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  Popular has decided to modernize a large portion of its branch offices. </seg>
<seg id="3">  Altogether 200 of this are established in the economy strongest regions of Spain. </seg>
<seg id="4">  For the institute which operates under the brand name Popular Max these branch offices mean a big milestone. </seg>
<seg id="5">  Popular as the first bank group represents the jump but also for the remaining Spanish institutes since the opening hours of its branch offices prolong H to 20.30 on weekdays and H to 20.30 set H of 10 on Saturdays dares. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">  The bank group of BBVA also read the prolongation of its opening hours in the branch offices repeated be reported, this one hasn't taken a definite decision till now yet. </seg>
<seg id="7">  The negotiations of the bank going on at present with the labor unions seeming to aim at an agreement, which be closed 75% of all branch offices on Saturdays and open for this on a weekday in the afternoon if also not for the customers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">  Whether further banks of the new initiative which adapts to the business opening hours follow will depend on the empirical values of the Popular Bank. </seg>
<seg id="9">  And this is just the intention which pursues Popular with its project, too. </seg>
<seg id="10">  It is aim to extend the opening hours of those branch offices which can include the customers of independent, small and perigynous enterprises inclined to buy but also these of large department stores due to their situation. </seg>
<seg id="11">  The bank would like to open the new 200 branch offices in the course of the next 18 months since it isn't new but changed opening hours. </seg>
<seg id="12">  The bank will alter the premises of those branch offices which already are in business zones and bring them into line with the individual customer image of the different zones simultaneously for this. </seg>
<seg id="13">  So the expansion of the opening hours gets connected to a new interior design of the branch offices which stands out due to a more current, more colorful design. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">  The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring doesn't require any larger investments but it would be accompanied by an increased staff attitude since a branch office needed no more six but eight or nine employees now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">  The branch offices which even will be equipped with additional premises for the SMEs won't sell any financial products. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  Its concept has already tested Popular to nine branch offices in Madrid. </seg>
<seg id="18">  And the empirical values turned out positive, so Ángel Rivero. </seg>

<seg id="1">  The Spanish independent radio Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and therefore overtakes its rival Antena 3. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  We have made it?. </seg>
<seg id="3">  With this sentence the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, made his satisfaction known at the stock market close. The transmitter escorted by him had his value around the double one his increases rivals Antena 3. </seg>
<seg id="4">  An aspect, however, dampened his joy: This is exactly?what me this is injured; it didn't state a higher growth, that we, but that we had lower losses?,. </seg>
<seg id="5">  It emphasized that she hasn't sunk too deeply?despite the weak market. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">  Telecinco ended the day with a positive balance of 2.54% yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="7">  This profit decreases its previous this year's losses on 15.66%. </seg>
<seg id="8">  According to information from Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4,488.88 million euros now in which Mediaset checks the main share of the capital (52%) and Vocento is involved only with 13%. </seg>
<seg id="9">  The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has to register a loss of altogether 40.5% since January so that his market value amounts to the half with 2,193.46 million. </seg>
<seg id="10">  The market value of other listed communication enterprises, however, increases; in the case of Sogecable on 3,571 million at Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) on 2,518.53 million and at Vocento on 1,779 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">  The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that himself?it is two similar enterprises?, so Vasile. </seg>
<seg id="12">  The question on which scale we can actually stock exchange technically proceed uncertainly still turns up for which price and how we can design it lucrative on customer level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">  Telecinco explained its plan a week ago to climb to the first TV station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue this year. This assured the advertising enterprise of the group of Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña. </seg>
<seg id="14">  If the plan should be realized, the transmitter would increase its advertising earnings in comparison with the 965.4 million by 3.6% from the previous year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">  In the case of Antena 3 the net sales increased (up to 734.4 million) by 1.6% within the first nine stock exchange months while the net earnings could show only an increase in 0.7% (630.4 million) out of the watching TV business. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">  The analysts see the main factor for the stock exchange course better in the comparison of Telecinco which the company could show until present time Payout reason at the high one: The enterprise escorted by Alejandro Echevarría arranged for a 100 per cent dividend payout in 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  Vasile assures, however, that still could vary the reason after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol with Mediaset as a parent company even if it is still too early for an official announcement. </seg>
<seg id="18">  We are obliged to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares out even if we have shown off always considerably more till now?. </seg>
<seg id="19">  I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year whose share values we could already increase by the purchase of 33% of the Endemol shares. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">  According to statement of the analysts the market is showing certain loss trends at present. </seg>
<seg id="21">  Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced his profit calculation by 7% at Telecinco for this year by 4% and for 2009. </seg>
<seg id="22">  This is the result of the cut in the expected rate of increase which will decline in 2008 from 10.5% to 8.4% and in 2009 from 5.5% to 5.1%. </seg>
<seg id="23">  This also has reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">  3 options. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">  1. </seg>

<seg id="1">  Which insurance is suited for me best? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  The motor vehicle insurance which covers a possible claim caused by the driver contains a high expense of age, sex, time of the preparation of the driver's license, marital status, type of the car to be insured and its use, among others whose height of re-rum of different factors takes off etc.. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">  It is only the beginning to have a car. </seg>
<seg id="4">  Because it is even more difficult to find the fitting motor vehicle insurance than the right vehicle model. </seg>
<seg id="5">  At first once must be clear for one with which we have to do it here. </seg>
<seg id="6">  A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">  This agreement is in writing held tight by means of an insurance contract which fixes that the society gets the arranged insurance premium and is engaged in return to present the corresponding compensation sum at a claim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">  The insurance premium is the price of an insurance among others age, sex, time of the preparation of the driver's license, marital status, type of the vehicle to be insured or its use which gets together by several factors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">  The insurance enterprises fix their prices according to the statistics so that in case of a higher accident danger also larger payments of contribution get due. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">  Having to for this reason both about 25-year and make women less payments of contribution because statistics prove that these groups show a lower accident rate thanks to their caution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">  The same also applies to married persons according to statement of the statistical values and therefore also after conviction the enterprise, too less accidents incline these, since as singles. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">  The use which is attached to the vehicle impairs the frequency of the driving and thus also the probability of an accident. </seg>
<seg id="13">  The more frequent the use, the more probable the damage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">  At the list of the bonus the insurances must take into account a whole number of points. </seg>
<seg id="15">  For this reason the driver also must study the situation thoroughly to select exactly the car insurance which most likely approaches his personal needs. </seg>
<seg id="16">  We list the most important points now in this place which one should draw at the choice of an insurance into respect to be not able to make only performance, but also a price oriented choice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  Meet the less than 25-year-old numerous obstacles, such as the low driving experience and this one?young in the choice of a reasonably priced insurance? Driver's license. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">  Even if it would be the best for an ideal insurance cover to effect a fully comprehensive insurance, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">  The careful drivers can select a fully comprehensive insurance with percentage excess so that the services of a fully comprehensive insurance are covered but offered at a low price. </seg>
<seg id="20">  This kind of contract contains that the customer must pay a part of the amount arisen from the damage himself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">  The amount is?fixed before conclusion of the contract and using the amount of the insurance premium. This is more highly?, the lower the sum to be paid Luis Noguera, main representative of Spain at roof ridge Europe, explains to an arrangement enterprise for online insurances. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">  Another option isn't, however, the extended insurance against the damages arisen at the car of one's own which insures the customer against external accident damages. </seg>
<seg id="23">  In addition, this type of the insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">  Here one piece of advice. </seg>
<seg id="25">  If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hand to lower the insurance costs; so your credit note increases by trying to drive carefully and to avoid accidents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">  A credit note is a reduction in the base rate at the appropriate insurance company. </seg>
<seg id="27">  A punishing payment on the contrary contains an increase in a said rate to this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">  Yields take off the height of credit notes and punishing payments?of the society and this one. </seg>
<seg id="29">  If the enterprise has a yield rich year behind itself, can permit himself to increase the bonus payments?, Noguera explains. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">  As soon as the 25 annual brand is exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. Reason for it is the fact that with an increasing driving experience the accident rate drops. </seg>
<seg id="31">  It therefore makes most sense to decide in favor of a fully comprehensive insurance with percentage excess. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">  The teenagers usually cannot not profit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of the driving??, this one explains abbots of the European enterprise Spanish and adds that the majority of the accidents happens in the second practice year after these?fear of the beginner? you put down. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">  It nevertheless is more advisable with a married customer who doesn't have any children to effect a fully comprehensive insurance; natural only then, if it also allows the financial situation of the corresponding person. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">  Married couple is regarded as the customers on the part of the insurers with children with the lowest accident rate and its payments of contribution correspondingly also turn out low. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">  In this case a fully comprehensive insurance would be the best option with percentage excess (at an amount by the 300 euros). One a high credit note has received, an extended insurance recommends this one only to the third vehicle year to itself in the case that shows commitment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">  Altogether, you drive?eased and have a greater spending power which permits it to them to attach a larger payment of contribution?, Luis Noguera states. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">  Offers one's services for pensioners whom employs only at a sufficiently high credit note to effect a fully comprehensive insurance with percentage excess (at an amount by the 150 euros) or an extended insurance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">  One must hold tight at long last that it is the car insurance a little very important that a thorough choice is made which corresponds to our personal situation not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damages but also because it holds high costs which require it. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  A new price quarrel burns off slowly what the danger increases between the Ukraine and Russia that Russian exports of fuel are impaired to Western Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">  The largest portion of the Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) is conducted by the Ukraine and every quarrel between the two nations is watched very exactly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">  Kiew has warned, that if Moscow increases the price which it must pay for the natural gas, it will bill for higher transit charges of Russia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">  An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU states. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">  The latest quarrel between Kiew and Moscow happens at a time at which the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom try to achieve an agreement about it how much the Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in the year 2008. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">  More must be charged to the Ukraine according to the Gazprom since the group has agreed to pay for natural gas up to 50% in addition from the neighboring Turkmenistan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">  Analysts say that this could mean, that 40% more must pay the Ukraine for the imports of Gazprom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">  "It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during conversations", told the Minister of Trade and Commerce to the Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">  "The natural gas prices changing should undoubtedly be connected with our arguments regarding the amount of the transit charges [to Western Europe] over the Ukraine." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">  In the last great natural gas quarrel between Moscow and Kiew in January 2006 cut Gazprom deliveries to the Ukraine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">  This led into consequence to Western Europe what drastically pushed the prices in the height to a case of the exports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">  Russian gas agrees on a quarter of the supply for the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">  Russia has the worldwide biggest gas deposits but much of this remains underdeveloped. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">  It is the consequence that Gazprom completes its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other central Asian former Soviet nations. </seg>

<seg id="2">  Mitt Romey said it doesn't regard one as candidates for the presidency worthily to be, questioned by a snowman. </seg>
<seg id="3">  The republican candidate nevertheless declared himself the presidency in the end ready to face a debate on YouTube in which normal voters on video take and submit questions to send it to the candidate. </seg>
<seg id="4">  Nones of the questions which were raised on the Wednesday evening, November 28th, were as ridiculous as the snowman which questioned democrats about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party. </seg>
<seg id="5">  But the questions and the answers reflected exactly the condition of the republican party this time which bursts in the elections next year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">  It isn't known, exact like the producers of CNNs which selected the debate YouTube supported co-to be shown these to the prospective candidates clips. </seg>
<seg id="7">  This one was dedicated to a single topic, Immigration was in the center however in the first half hour of the debate, the longest. </seg>
<seg id="8">  The topic is one of the most powerful topics for republicans. </seg>
<seg id="9">  The CNNs asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial if they heard things which they liked: The television organization noticed tops of the consent as the candidates strictly spoke about the limits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">  The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was in Iowa between Rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner and Romney, the surveys making up their mind in this one, and has shoved New Hampshire forwards. </seg>
<seg id="11">  Giuliani tries to shake the reputation off, it has been soft with regard to illegal Immigration when it was a mayor of New York. </seg>
<seg id="12">  He attacked Romney to have it hired the former governor immigrants who are accused by Massachusetts and illegal in this for work on its house. </seg>
<seg id="13">  The two sat down particularly intensely from each other as questioners wondered whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegal a regular status and the possibility on the citizenship). </seg>
<seg id="14">  More insignificant candidates like Duncan Hunter, a Californian convention representative, and Tom Tancredo, a convention representative from Colorado, it turned out well for this nachzuhaken topic. </seg>
<seg id="15">  Neither of the two men has grave chances at the nomination but both remain in the running perhaps because they have hit on the Immigrationspauke earlier and harder than other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">  The candidates share the same views at least in the area of the immigration in the great and whole: sharper limits, intolerance opposite illegal Migranten. </seg>
<seg id="17">  This topic helping the republicans together with fears over poisonous toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world to forget or to minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives. </seg>
<seg id="18">  But the debate was were brought up obviously problematically as other topics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">  Mr Giuliani was asked why he has supported weapon restrictions in the past. </seg>
<seg id="20">  John McCain and Romney discussed it whether you should regard as a torture drown feigned. </seg>
<seg id="21">  One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe the Bible every word. </seg>
<seg id="22">  This was the reason that Giuliani supported the point of view that although the Bible is its preferential book, it perhaps literally doesn't believe the story of Jonah and the whale. </seg>
<seg id="23">  Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty. </seg>
<seg id="24">  Mike Huckabee, Christian conservatism existing for a long time contrary to all expectations on the first place in a survey in Iowa recently carried out thanks to his now, said that the death penalty is painful but necessary. </seg>
<seg id="25">  You pressed he laughed about it as him Jesus had too intelligently to be advertised around himself around a political office, whether Jesus would approve her, and said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">  The running remains extremely wide open. </seg>
<seg id="27">  Huckabees advancement in Iowa falls together with Ron Paul's latest donation successes and its approval storms in the debate of Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="28">  These two have very shot from the trifle because, till now, the both wings of the party couldn't agree on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates yet. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">  Offending the intelligence of the brits in a stupid way when the governor had escaped the demand for a choice two months ago by claiming that opinion polls wouldn't have influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government. </seg>
<seg id="7">  This one liberally expressed democrats, it like Vince Cable, the increasingly astute representation chairman instead, the once dreaded Brown has developed from Stalin into Mr. Bean. </seg>
<seg id="8">  The clumsy rescue of Northern skirt, a shattered bank, showed regulatorische weakness and bad discernment under fire. </seg>
<seg id="9">  Badly thought-out suggestions for the change of the revenue laws have set enterprise associations against the government. </seg>
<seg id="10">  The tax official loss of person-related data of 25 million people showed inconceivable administrative bunglings. </seg>
<seg id="11">  A trio of generals in the retirement started a rebellion in the upper house as a protest against abridgements of armed forces expenditure: They claimed so, it is a part-time job to be a secretary of the forces. </seg>
<seg id="12">  There are the various donations of David Abrahams now; Peter Watt, Labours Secretary General (and its former fulfillment leader) already are stepped down. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="13">  Irrevocably direction hands over nothing meant by it to Brown that bursts. </seg>
<seg id="14">  Governments can nevertheless reach a turning point after which they feel it to rule by no means. </seg>
<seg id="15">  Still being allowed to trust people politicians but they usually hold their scepticism back if a new troop seizes the office. </seg>
<seg id="16">  If it is clear once that it is improbable that a prime minister improves the situation and he doesn't need even to be long yet, this delay is past: the public service starts to get leaky; the cabinet secretaries start to talk; the press is looking for bad news; and the government gets defensive and aimless. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  In a way the position of Brown is particularly difficult because he cannot claim unlike other political leaders to be a new broom. </seg>
<seg id="18">  So like to deny Tony Blair it would, it was his first lieutenant. </seg>
<seg id="19">  The problems with Northern skirt and the tax responsibility documents for example hangs together with decisions which Brown as a chancellor of the Treasury took. </seg>
<seg id="20">  In Blair's mishap, as in the case of the long "financial for title" examination of a political party financing, the voters possibly assume and even if the notly direct involviert was that it was it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">  Browns situation is nevertheless not quite as bad as it looks </seg>
<seg id="22">  The transgressions aren't as terrible as the conservatives describe them. </seg>
<seg id="23">  Mr. is Bean, nobody died or became completely beschwindelt as in the case of. </seg>
<seg id="24">  And the antidote, painful may be like it, are handed in, had what promised Browns of course Stalinist trends always: A reliable, solid and easy brutal government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">  The new to-do around political donations is a good example. </seg>
<seg id="26">  He says to the garboeske Abrahams which compares its donations with its charitable gifts no public recognition wishes for his goodwill. </seg>
<seg id="27">  This may be perhaps so but the decision on it wasn't entitled to it. </seg>
<seg id="28">  The laws against anonymity for tall political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know closed whom himself, entrance to the can buy, which rules over the land. </seg>
<seg id="29">  This one says, he would have of Abraham's agreement known about but not that it is illegal watt gets himself natural some questions must arise; exact like Jon Mendlesohn, Labours main finance recoverer whom the strange donations were told about in October. </seg>
<seg id="30">  But, till now, Brown isn't involved: There is nothing that indicates that he knew about these confusions although the largest portion of the payments was made after his assumption of office post in June. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">  The prime minister has taken care of the half of the work till now. </seg>
<seg id="32">  He has the violation of the laws by his party sentenced in the retirement and a judge fast he diluted this determination to fill measure up around which by reaching for a known instrument, a commission of inquiry to the topic, led, however, of a bishop. </seg>
<seg id="33">  In this case the "teachings to be drawn from it" aren't very complicated. </seg>
<seg id="34">  If the law was broken, it is a thing for the police. </seg>
<seg id="35">  There are except for it other things the Mr Brown must, in the public life, to find a permanent chairman how a little for the independent committee for standards which has been unoccupied for six months and to make progress with a radical reform of a political party financing make. </seg>

<seg id="1">  Card sharks </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  Does the credit crisis infect America's credit card market? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">  If blood is in the water, it is is only natural that dorsal fins irritated around whirls. </seg>
<seg id="4">  Now where America's property market is ailing, the beasts of prey have the credit card market of the country in the visor. </seg>
<seg id="5">  Analysts of Goldman Sachs expect that the credit card losses could reach 99 billion dollars if the risk of infection of underfunded loans spreads on other forms of consumption loans. </seg>
<seg id="6">  Symptoms of the strain are considerably visible. </seg>
<seg id="7">  There are increases both at the end bookings and at the default rates which measure the share of the loans which respectively aren't retractable or more when 30 days too late. </seg>
<seg id="8">  The HSBC has because of the weak side of credit card recipients partly announced last month that it has taken a 1.4 billion dollars charges elevation from its American consumer financings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">  It is nevertheless too early to sink into panic. </seg>
<seg id="10">  Losses and defaults are still low. </seg>
<seg id="11">  A full percentage point below the historical average was almost the third party quarter Säumnissrate of 3.89% according to the Ratingagentur Moody. </seg>
<seg id="12">  The deterioration at the rates can partly be explained by technical factors. </seg>
<seg id="13">  A change in the American led private insolvency on the right laws to an abrupt case of bankruptcy registrations which in turn agree on a large portion of the Keditkartenverluste for one into 2005; registrations (and with that default fines) would this one rise again whether the number the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">  The industry also reports of solid payment rates which show how much the consumers pay every month off of their debts </seg>
<seg id="15">  and the confidence in credit card based securities is rather strong despite the interruption in other corners of the structured financing. </seg>
<seg id="16">  Dennis Moroney of the control tower Group, a research enterprise, expects that the amounts of version for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year in the end. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  There surely are direct infection channels between the property credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more probable that consumers raise credit card debts, now that own home loans dry out. </seg>
<seg id="18">  The card exhibitors look but therefore dropping house prices don't redeem a bill of exchange necessarily in the credit rating of the borrower on the money river instead of on capital values. </seg>
<seg id="19">  You even can be for the card exhibitors of advantage. </seg>
<seg id="20">  The incentives for consumers furthermore to pay the mortgage rates diminish if the real estate is worth some as the value of the loan; as a result the card debts get more important under the repayment priorities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">  Card exhibitors also can much faster and more flexibly react as a lender to the stormier conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits. </seg>
<seg id="22">  This should theoretically reduce the risk of a fast reassessment of the assets. </seg>
<seg id="23">  "We won't wake up one day and the loans completely newly judge", says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones main finance speaker. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">  Even if a sudden cover shortage crisis is improbable in the credit card market, the risks of a lasting downturn are substantially more real. </seg>
<seg id="25">  If lower house prices and a credit reduction press America in the recession, the industry will stand undoubtedly before a more furious future. </seg>
<seg id="26">  They hold the far lookout for these shark fins. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="7">  Their case is a loose end of an examination which was started to Enrons collapse in 2001 in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8">  The accusations submitted against it originally in the year 2002 drew Fastow attention to the fact that it was the aim of an examination of the government in connection with the Enron decline. </seg>

<seg id="13">  The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars for a participation in this enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="14">  According to the charges Fastow represented wrongly, that opposite Enron the energy enterprise would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">  The 20 million dollars but actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others. </seg>
<seg id="16">  Did 7.3 million dollars get the bankers during Fastow, Kopper, and cashed in other about 12.3 million dollars according to the charges. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  Fastow declared itself for its role in two counts of an indictment on conspiracy in the Enrons flop guiltily in January 2004. </seg>

<seg id="19">  Fastow serves a 6-year prison sentence in federal prison of Louisiana. </seg>
<seg id="20">  Kopper serves a sentence of three years and a month in facilities in Texarkana. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">  Each of the three men was on free foot due to a 1 million dollar bail which required it that they lived in expectation of the legal proceedings in the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">  Enron, once the siebtgrößte enterprise of the nation crumbled in the bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of book-keeping tricks could cover the billion debts up or make weak businesses seem profitable no more. </seg>
<seg id="23">  The collapse destroyed thousands from jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars Pensionspläne. </seg>

<seg id="16">  There was much this one will play in the last season better in the first test apparently when, for example when James Anderson were even if Stephen Harmison pronounces himself healthy and as the wind plays ninepins into the nets. </seg>
<seg id="17">  Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 rushes each to earn a position in this tour. </seg>
<seg id="18">  Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average but both had their highlights and hope for still more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">  Whether Shah or Bopara plays in the Asgiriya stage can be only a view question. </seg>
<seg id="20">  The choice could decide the careers of both men or it perhaps really makes little difference. </seg>
<seg id="21">  Four years ago in Sri Lanka and this one played Gareth Batty in every test and was successfully rushes in the first, with five Wickets and useful to 40, it was, however, Paul Collingwood to consolidate, which passed the breakthrough to an important test cricket player although it perhaps still is, a double one one hundred against Australia in Australia punk head of a column underestimated, at that time, still fighting for himself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">  Probable is that youthful enthusiasm will their conservative instincts and belly sense of Shah's greater experience follow, Vaughan and Moores, Graveney, after another discussion in the course of today's net meeting in the Asgiriya stage about Boparas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">  There are arguments for both. </seg>
<seg id="24">  His scintillating and valuable 88 test debut Innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, which is seven years younger with 22 years and an excellent balance speak against switched on roll for Shah. </seg>
<seg id="25">  But Shah made May to only ten rushes into his two Innings in this against the west Indies in the test into Lord, his native country arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection, from the end voters as Vaughan was well the swing take back around for the next, his position seems from his beat taken, still in Bombay obvious have this one game was. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">  Unlike this the all-rounder has in shovelfuls zest for life from Essex. </seg>
<seg id="27">  Recently one vehicle with four-wheel drive in an exhibition it is impressed by nothing on a cricket place and its attitude away from this was taken to the point, as it England's sponsor Volkswagen had estimated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">  It suffered from smaller injuries and presumably a shock but it was the first which it did to get its Vodafone (of course also gesponsort) out and to call Alastair Cook which had watched this from the distance and to say with enthusiasm for its team colleagues: "Have you seen this?". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">  Bopara is a much better player on the field, it its middle speed plays ninepins with some effect here on the fields which seems to match it and beats with confidence and dexterity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">  A different one is to choose a thing, the right time to vote for the right man. </seg>
<seg id="31">  Perhaps this is the real art of the choice. </seg>
<seg id="32">  I tend to give Bopara its chance now, what doesn't mean that perhaps dastehen isn't for Shah anyway well if it is the one as suggests the tea sentence from Ceylon who will play this weekend here. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">  The smallest federal state is leading at the vocational training and shines even with the international orientation of its universities. </seg>
<seg id="3">  Only in an education field the same pushes the inhabitants of Saar deficit like the rest of the country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">  "I have explained for the 50th time to a not inhabitant of Saar yesterday that we aren't Frenchmen" -- the smallest federal state placards this slogan self ironically for its 50th birthday. </seg>
<seg id="5">  In this France and Luxembourg play a large role in the educational system of the Saarland which lies on place five in the education monitor of the institute of the German economy Cologne (IW). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">  So the universities already cooperate narrowly with the neighboring countries from tradition. </seg>
<seg id="7">  The university in Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 of the Frenchmen. </seg>
<seg id="8">  To this day can studying here with a double or even triple diploma complete her studies. </seg>
<seg id="9">  The share is correspondingly high foreign studying with 15.6 per cent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">  But the Saarland also brings the natives of a country in number above average to the universities, much of them without a degree at the high school. </seg>
<seg id="11">  "One uses the professional educational system in the Saarland", says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW. </seg>
<seg id="12">  More than every fifth teenager purchases his studies right at a vocational school so that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average. </seg>
<seg id="13">  The combination possibilities of a professional and academic education are also comparatively expanded strongly. </seg>
<seg id="14">  Measured in terms of the total population the equipment is the second best one in Germany with dual courses of studies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">  Despite the practical education and increasing demand the number of the engineer graduates has dropped by a third, however, within the last years. </seg>
<seg id="16">  The Saarland education department has committed the universities to doing a marketing campaign for engineer scientific subjects therefore now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  "We have initiated quite a number of reforms after the first Pisa study" at the schools with general educational value, says a spokeswoman of the education department. </seg>
<seg id="18">  So the government introduced nationwide comparison tests. </seg>
<seg id="19">  It is free of charge to learn to use to begin the children the last Kita year, a model which meanwhile also other federal states copy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">  The performances of the pupils improve lastingly, will show themselves only future comparison studies whether. </seg>
<seg id="21">  The share of the Risikoschüler shrank from 29 to 20 per cent at Pisa 2003. </seg>
<seg id="22">  Altogether, the Saarland, however, didn't increase as strongly as other federal states. </seg>
<seg id="23">  The Bavarians calculate better. </seg>
<seg id="24">  Points -- and to the frustration of the inhabitants of Saar Fremdsprachenkenntnise aren't measured at Pisa otherwise one could in this area. </seg>
<seg id="25">  Because the language of the neighbors is duty to high schools -- even if the inhabitants of Saar aren't Frenchmen. </seg>

<seg id="1">  Venus is the infernal Gemini of the earth </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  Venus is more similar than thought till now despite her anti-life atmosphere of the earth: The European space probe "Venus express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind whirl to the Pole as it appears also on the earth in winter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">  For almost three decades scientists have suspected that there is lightning on Venus. </seg>
<seg id="4">  The European probe "Venus express" has furnished the proof now, it tracked down electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoots to cloud in a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud, Christopher Russel of the University of California reports in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">  Having let lightning according to the famous "Ursuppen theory" arise the life on the earth: Thunderstorms shall have activated reactions in the ocean which led to the formation of amino acids, the constituents of the life. </seg>
<seg id="6">  On Venus not so: Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington "must, if there ever were lives there, have been it in the very early history", explains. </seg>
<seg id="7">  Might give Venus hardly something live on the surface today: The atmosphere is around one hundred times thick than on the earth, there are temperatures of 500 degrees from time to time. </seg>
<seg id="8">  "Perhaps Venus is the devil Gemini of the earth but she is a Gemini", said Russel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">  Why Venus who is so similar to the earth in mass and size has smashed a so completely other development is the basic question of the Esa mission. </seg>
<seg id="10">  The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research since since the beginning of the nineties no more probe was away specifically for the investigation of this planet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">  The latest research results which are introduced now in several "Nature" articles underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in opinion of the researchers within the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="12">  "You also show that, with the earth, the things in common of our neighbor planet are greater than at first assumed", informs the Esa. </seg>
<seg id="13">  So found cloud whirlpools also unite the researchers besides the already known whirlwind at the North Pole at the South Pole which turns still considerably faster. </seg>
<seg id="14">  A researcher team writes around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica the phenomenon reminds of streams of air on the earthly winter hemisphere. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">  The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost just as big with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id="16">  The planet also described as a morning or evening star revolves around the sun within almost 225 days. </seg>
<seg id="17">  However, he concerns much more slowly himself: A Venustag lasts for 243 earth days. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">  Although Venus hardly reminds of the earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees centigrade and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets have arisen under quite similar prerequisites. </seg>
<seg id="19">  Water which remained in oceans on the earth on which Venus was, however, lost to the space accumulated on both. </seg>
<seg id="20">  And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on the earth, it agrees on Venus on the large part of the atmosphere. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">  A hard exchange of blows -- and must be afraid of an outsider candidate now in the Youtube debate of the republican candidates for the presidency deliver the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney to themselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">  The strain of the candidates already unloads itself for the first topic. </seg>
<seg id="4">  It has made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney reproaches its opponents for Rudy Giuliani. </seg>
<seg id="5">  This counters for his part with difficult reproaches: This "I would say its own house was a port for illegal", Giuliani replies and throws former governor of Massachusetts in front of, to have privately employed immigrants without papers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">  The candidates blow for the attack: Because furthermore the republican base doesn't have any clear favorite, the eight presidency candidates use the debate on CNNs primarily to discredit their adversaries. </seg>
<seg id="7">  30 second videos, the Internet users this one have roll-ups sent in via Youtube, are hardly more than keyword giver. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">  John McCain reproaches his opponent Ron Paul who demands an immediate discount as the only one in the round from Iraq "we have let Hitler come to the power" with this kind of isolationism. </seg>
<seg id="9">  Also Romney gets strongly the read of the Vietnam veteran, as it an interrogation method refuses, the so-called "Waterboarding", drown which you feign but to condemn torture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">  The reactions of the hall audience show Petersburg in piece in Floridas that the important topics of the campaign lie, however, on the other side of Iraq war and torture debates meanwhile. </seg>
<seg id="11">  When conservative values are always praised and future tax increases declined approval surges in the lecture-hall. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">  More lets himself be seen once where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie. </seg>
<seg id="13">  "I have been mistaken at that time", it Romney explains remorsefully and makes in front of base and viewers its apology for this that was still proper in 1994 to the abortion supporters. </seg>
<seg id="14">  Giuliani, however, starts lurching from side to side, you ask for its opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible as it. </seg>

<seg id="1">  The fathers of the cabbage skirt return </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  Germany's super group of the seventies plays instruments again: The three ribbon members of Harmonia got to work on their consoles at a concert in Berlin once more. </seg>
<seg id="3">  For the revival one seems recorded from her great time "live 1974". </seg>
<seg id="4">  Even then they were fundamentally more famous abroad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">  The arranged sensation then happens at the evening panel in the form of three of sedate sirs. </seg>
<seg id="6">  Everybody has his small box in front of himself, his cables and primarily his buttons. </seg>
<seg id="7">  Dieter Moebius sits enthroned in the flower white shirt in the middle with 63 years. </seg>
<seg id="8">  Links flanked of Michael Rother 57 years young and in the possession of laptop computer and guitar. </seg>
<seg id="9">  Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends himself concentratedly at the console, looked from the lecture-hall on the right. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">  From time to time, everybody even contributes noises beat, unite. </seg>
<seg id="11">  And sometimes it makes inadvertently a conventional piece of music. </seg>
<seg id="12">  This then doesn't seem to disturb the sirs greatly either itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">  That the band Harmonia plays instruments again has under cabbage skirt enthusiasts for some excitement worried. </seg>
<seg id="14">  In which one may reveal here: However, specific demands showed so lastingly not at all that although the name buzzed by the collective pop memory to miss this band for 32 years painfully. </seg>
<seg id="15">  But why shall not the German be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies either? </seg>
<seg id="16">  Particularly since what is misleadingly called cabbage skirt was always than in the country of one's own more valid in England and America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  Group of Can 2003 awarded the echo prize for the life's work to the survivors of the inhabitants of Cologne, one saw in the hall into questioning German pop faces as the music economy. </seg>
<seg id="18">  Himself talk Hot chilli pepper of Pepper as this one in the eulogy also with the bands La Düsseldorf and new! the astonishment didn't know any limits thanked you. </seg>
<seg id="19">  At concerts Michael Rother squated at the talk Hot chilli pepper of Pepper on the stage like an old buddy later. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">  Transfiguration is the one the problem of the ignorance in the foreign parts at home and this one. </seg>
<seg id="21">  The memory is already therefore overtaxed with Harmonia because the trio existed for only two years and a far lower effect power than they were assigned to afterwards of other also developed at this time. </seg>
<seg id="22">  Moebius and Roedelius had played instruments already before under the promising name cluster with the artist Conrad Schnitzler. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">  At first one played in the cellar under the Berlin theater. </seg>
<seg id="24">  After this in Düsseldorf for economic reasons for a record label maintained of the church. </seg>
<seg id="25">  Rother had the at that time perhaps most radical German group, a reputation erspielt, helped out and following as a guitarist at new!, at power station briefly. </seg>
<seg id="26">  Rother followed the cluster musicians at 1973 into the exile to forest in the Weser hilly scenery, though. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">  They lived as town brief communards there in the old Weser court, a ruin from the 16th century. </seg>
<seg id="28">  Less ideological than in the commune I, where Roedelius still was allowed to be troubled as a nanny. </seg>
<seg id="29">  Rather in spitzweghaftem artist existence. </seg>
<seg id="30">  Allegedly a pennant of the singing club also found itself Harmonia Ottenstein in the bulky refuse and for the art a name. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">  Some held Harmonia of this tight. </seg>
<seg id="32">  The first album was called "music of Harmonia" and the following "de luxe". </seg>
<seg id="33">  Because the music so calmly and modestly also sounded, the band suffered a material need. </seg>
<seg id="34">  The Reisigsammeln didn't serve alone the self finding. </seg>
<seg id="35">  In front of an only just 50-headed record scenery, the CD "live 1974" appeared now was recorded for somebody thinks at a concert in Griessem like itself to remember. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">  The desire to push Harmonia and to practice occasionally came from Rother at that time. </seg>
<seg id="37">  For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand. </seg>
<seg id="38">  The band explained its separation in 1975. </seg>
<seg id="39">  Rother landed in the esoteric spherical one and secured its existence for itself with albs like "fiery hearts". </seg>
<seg id="40">  Cluster was revived in the eighties and is more successful than it was ever Harmonia since then. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">  The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer. </seg>
<seg id="42">  It has aimed at the record firm Greenland, the cabbage skirt as a very own German contribution to cultivate music to the live one. </seg>
<seg id="43">  New! did you already dig up like Roedelius solo plant? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">  The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world. </seg>
<seg id="45">  Subsidized publicly in the context of the festival Woldtronics. </seg>
<seg id="46">  Julian Cope is there, the brit, old punk and author of the manual "cabbage skirt sampler". </seg>
<seg id="47">  The Loveparade inventor is also Dr. Motte there. </seg>
<seg id="48">  With what the complete frequency range of the influences of the cabbage skirt on the following pop music would be outlined. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">  The blank of the super group is filled out by Harmonia. </seg>
<seg id="50">  The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most peculiar Sounds in the hall: "Music only keeps, these the future belongs to her." </seg>
<seg id="51">  There are pictures which show the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse parlor. </seg>
<seg id="52">  Projections of additional black-and-white photos of confusedly cabled equipment serve the putting formation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">  In front of that the three veterans are occupied with the improvisation again. </seg>
<seg id="54">  Not eliciting outrageous tones from instruments around which over effect equipment built any more by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums. </seg>
<seg id="55">  The electronic music looks like electronic music today. </seg>
<seg id="56">  Tinkerer deepened three into the technical one. </seg>
<seg id="57">  To this the choir of the house also changes nothing. </seg>
<seg id="58">  The line Barbara Morgensterns is coughed and whispered under Soundwolken and sung in a beautiful place with emphasis under. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">  Cabbage skirt was always a very English concept. </seg>
<seg id="60">  It never was skirt. </seg>
<seg id="61">  The roots were looked for less than in colleges of music (Can), technologies (power station) or on the flight with artistic and social conventions (clusters) in the blues. </seg>
<seg id="62">  Who here 68 calls, not quite is wrong and Harmonia cannot be brought by it now either from the quiet. </seg>
<seg id="63">  The most natural is reconsidered thoroughly on the stage. </seg>
<seg id="64">  Where does music begin and when does she stop? </seg>
<seg id="65">  This can rob one of the nerves or grant brief moments of great happiness. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  "The Hunting party" and "dreadful peace" deal with two films with the Balkankrieg again. </seg>
<seg id="3">  But both don't convince. </seg>
<seg id="4">  The concepts put too much on action and Geballer or else they are too touching either. </seg>
<seg id="5">  Richard Gere cannot help in "The Hunting party" there either. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">  The good news first: The war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans but the actors' Richard Gere has been found again now there in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnia war of all things. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">  We had lost the most beautiful man of the eighties from the eyes last because too many nice inconsequential roles cured one of the inclination for looking in well feeling films for women and too many press conferences to the Buddhism topic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">  Richard is suddenly javelins the most important argument, himself, The Hunting party " -- if the hunter becomes the chased " now why look?) perhaps anyway, today, film titles must always be so long and confused actually like train driver wage agreements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">  He delivers a wonderfully winking representation: His war reporter Simon Hunt is, taken in the reason this what would have been able to be from javelin if destiny and the film industry were not so merciful: Decline has still a man his who has his very best times behind himself for a long time kept considerable remains of the former charm this one but himself as a monument identical in ruin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">  But despite this trump "The Hunting party" together with the German production, "dreadful peace", which also starts this week continues only the endless row of failed Balkankriegs films. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">  "Dreadful peace" can with one put on a short trial: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian from kosovarischen snipers, on whom the one promptly also falls in love with them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">  Although it is welcome that, once, the Serbians aren't represented as an only root of all evil here, the television flat film loses itself fast too in Geballer and action. </seg>
<seg id="13">  However, it remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without freeway for this with war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">  On the other hand, can be investigated virtually exemplarily to "The Hunting party" why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie actually. </seg>
<seg id="15">  Perhaps a new "Apocalypse Now" could have become the story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to "the fox" track down the Serbian top war criminal with another director and a different one scriptwriter (both into personal union Richard Shepard) at another time. </seg>
<seg id="16">  Because the Storys are alike frappierend: Small teams don't go what the armed forces both times to the woods it becomes a journey into the insanity be able to to accomplish something and both times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  One is one of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting party" that Simon Hunt doesn't simply let the shabby cynic as whom he is introduced to us at the beginning be with heart. </seg>
<seg id="18">  A romantic affair with a Muslim Bosnian andichten murdered later must still no the script for it on top of everything. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">  Definitely, "The Hunting party" goes the creek down then if the reporters succeed in the time-lapse photography method within the last five minutes which Nato, CIA and all headhunters of the world haven't made within five years: Catching the war criminal and leaving to the Muslim Bosnians for the just revenge. </seg>
<seg id="20">  This is so bad that one would like to call the international court of justice in The Hague against the cinema logic because of crimes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">  The film has a deeply human request. </seg>
<seg id="22">  He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still run around freely and he doesn't suspect the Americans and the Frenchmen (here shall they agree for once) to do the following due to secret political arrangements too intensively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">  But are so similarly the thought well and the bad one sometimes that a famous Brecht poem comes one into the meaning. </seg>
<seg id="24">  It is called in it over the wood mask of an Asian demon on the work-table of the poet: "I sympathetically see the swollen veins in the temple, indicating: how exhausting it is to be bad ". </seg>
<seg id="25">  Films like "The Hunting party" have exactly such swelling heads which, however, indicate how exhausting, well to be, it is. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">  The problem isn't limited on the genre of the Balkankriegsfilms. </seg>
<seg id="27">  Recently is in this newspaper reports got, that all Iraq films of Hollywood were large flops. </seg>
<seg id="28">  One can add: There has never been a good South Africa film, too. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">  Be almost always valid: If a starling knocks around on the flash points or minefields of the world, then something like that comes out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "hereafter of all limits", with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio. </seg>
<seg id="30">  All the conflicts are possibly from the point of view of time simply still too near. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">  After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood with "Schindler's list" could shoot a good film about the holocaust. </seg>
<seg id="32">  Many a film still will well mature, the Vietnam plants "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" being regarded as a classic now or "Full Metal jacket" has unanimously at that time yes not at all been celebrated as masterpieces. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">  But perhaps we know, where on the same two screens today every mass murder in real time amounts at home, also simple too much about the conflicts of the world. </seg>
<seg id="34">  And this robs the film script authors of the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs to tell good stories. </seg>
<seg id="35">  Yes, his or nonexistence has therefore got so good, after all, because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know yet how badly there was really the Nazi regime " " or "the great dictator", too. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">  Perhaps one mustn't want to be good if one wants to make good films. </seg>
<seg id="37">  Perhaps one must have the sarcastically distant artist look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk. </seg>
<seg id="38">  When this one was questioned to parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières dictionary" and the Balkankrieg, he answered: "This only lies that some things never change. </seg>
<seg id="39">  Cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and war always will be in Yugoslavia." </seg>

<seg id="2">  Moving the mayor of the application of Hamburg for Olympic summer Games away has met with intense criticism in politics and economy. </seg>
<seg id="3">  Many want to fight for the games further at the water. </seg>

<seg id="5">  The general executive manager of the Board of Trade Hamburg, Hans Jörg Schmidt Trenz, didn't describe a renunciation as " good for the industrial location " on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="6">  No other project has developed such big motivation strengths in the town as the Olympiaidee quite recently. </seg>
<seg id="7">  "Without this aim the sports political swing wouldn't be in the position to be maintained in the same measure." </seg>
<seg id="8">  Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate not to bury the project but to find a new long-term approach for this "which starts out from a changed time beam." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">  Mayor Ole of Beust kept to earlier statements on Wednesday, after what the Olympiaambitionen Hamburgss are unrealistic at least up to the year 2028. </seg>
<seg id="10">  Olympiabewerbung but the German Olympic sports federation decides, on one " not Hamburg " world online said of Beust. </seg>
<seg id="11">  He referred to the decision of the sports federation expected for the beginning of December over an application of Munich for the Winter Games 2018. </seg>
<seg id="12">  "This preference means for us that in this no realistic chances will angedachten time period us have from us to 2028 till now." </seg>
<seg id="13">  The dream nevertheless wasn't from dreamt for all time said of Beust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">  The Hamburg sports federation (HSB) was sorry for the statements of Beusts. </seg>
<seg id="15">  By the fact that Hamburg doesn't want to apply any more for Olympic Games within the next 25 years the impression is given. </seg>
<seg id="16">  "It is too early to obstruct itself a chance by one burying the plans already at this time", said HSB president Günter Ploß on Wednesday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  Moreover, a renunciation of the application contradicts the statement of the senate boss on the occasion of a reception concerning the general meeting of the general German high school sport association. </seg>
<seg id="18">  There 2015 has described the application of Hamburg "not as a substitute" of Beust for the Universiade for Olympic Games in Hamburg. </seg>
<seg id="19">  The high school sport association had nominated Hamburg as an applicant town only last week. </seg>

<seg id="1">  These aren't Warhols boxes </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2">  Thinks to Ikea who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden box but not to Andy Warhol. </seg>
<seg id="3">  Or anyway? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">  At present, wooden boxes produced in Sweden are throwing dark shade on Warhols work list. </seg>
<seg id="5">  Fakes are a large part of the ninety-four Brillo boxings of the "type Stockholm" listed there. </seg>
<seg id="6">  After the Swedish newspaper "expresses" has stirred doubt about the genuineness of Andy Warhols Brillo boxings of the year 1968 up some months ago, internal investigations are arriving at a conclusion sobering up in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now: The six "Brillo-Boxes" which former museum director Pontus Hultén has bequeathed to the Moderna Museet 1995 as a gift, copies and well are also the large part of the another about one hundred Brillo boxings of the "type Stockholm", these on the international art market into circulation are. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">  The past history is more artistically chaining confusing nested, one and kuratorischer productions. </seg>
<seg id="8">  Warhol created its first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes which are based on the red blue white design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo", in New York in 1964. </seg>
<seg id="9">  An exhibition of his work in the Moderna Museet 1968 exhibited hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard with Warhols consent: These weren't (from reasons of cost) of Warhol but were delivered directly from the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik. </seg>
<seg id="10">  It wasn't works of art but around the examples around bare exhibits. </seg>
<seg id="11">  At the same time, Warhol 1968 has given the permission well to let some few Brillo wooden boxes which weren't exhibited in the Moderna Museet, though produce in Sweden. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">  Contemporary witnesses are talking now about about fifteen boxes which have rightly gone down in art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol Brillo-Boxes with the name "type Stockholm" at that time. </seg>
<seg id="13">  More than 100 000 dollars have obtained some of them on auctions. </seg>
<seg id="14">  It is the problem now about one hundred wooden boxes which Warhol then has left to it have been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968 that legendary museum director Pontus Hultén has claimed wrongly later. </seg>
<seg id="15">  Hulténs 105 boxes were only 1990 actually produced in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id="16">  Warhol was already three years dead at this time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">  Lars Byström, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, also has examined three next to Brillo-Boxes museum characteristic of six from a Swedish private property, which two 1968 were made in Stockholm: Your pressing chipboards were undercoated first and, abgeschmirgelt, white oil-based paint was applied with a brush after that. </seg>
<seg id="18">  The structure of the copies from the year 1990 however tells that the color was served with a painter role without flat coat directly on the pressing chipboard -- it in addition isn't around oil, pick out around acrylic paint. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">  These boxes "weren't authorized by the artist and should be removed by the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes", indicates the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "'Andy Warhol kind of Authentication board' doesn't come to another end in New York, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material if this." </seg>
<seg id="20">  These spare, in July, the Authentication board has admittedly announced to follow the "heavy accusations" in the area of the soap powder boxes are raised. </seg>
<seg id="21">  But one remains silent there since then. </seg>
