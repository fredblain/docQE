<p>
<seg id="4"> In the budaörser the price of the usual Christmas "napi" also this year around 16% were increased, but in all price increases of over per registered.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After the prices in the food markets in the last December ",", the price increase not out to be drastically, compared with the already high, former level.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, it has an effect on the consumers, certainly as a deterrent, that, in the last year for which they still far less had paid hoof, this year, not even for 10,000 is available.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The price of the "napi" shopping basket crossed the by at least 91 hoof examined in the markets.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The highest price amounted hoof.</seg>
<seg id="9"> (was the price at 6.800.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The prices for unicum and live fish, almost on increased strongly, however the prices for nut and poppy.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, when there was, however, for 139 forint.</seg>
<seg id="12"> It was with the product limited price slump with no less than 200 forint.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Surprising was here two Coca-Cola, the price of a bottle of less than 200 forint, thus including the drink cost pledge only 257.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless this year in the "napi" at the most expensive, and at best.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Our calculations indicate that the prices in the "napi" shopping basket with the Christmas in the last year, around 15, while Tesco and cut each around 18 per cent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between shopping basket of last year and the current year constituted 21%.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The average rise in prices was 1.480,00.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The average increase in prices in the previous case was still 1,206.00, however, the tax increase with the prices at last Christmas apparent.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Exactly this process has met the trade badly: apparently the department stores could not so right to decide what price margin they should use in the individual articles, since the effects of the increase in prices to the consumer were unforeseeable.</seg>
<seg id="20"> (if the vendor the peripheral speed of a product badly plans, it can by substantial profits fall in the price margin, after the choices).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The price increase of the "napi" goods in the past year so radically, that the most expensive basket the value of 2006 by 1720 exceeded, whereas the price difference at the cheapest basket only 844 forint fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Such extremes were not observed this year, since the most expensive basket cost around 1,630.00 forint more than in the previous year, and even with the cheapest, there was a rise in prices of forint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In comparison with the two last Christmas showed a catastrophic price increase the price of the daily consumer items on the in less than 20 months by more than 30%.</seg>
<seg id="24"> (this is not necessarily again confirms the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, with some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months, a more than a price increase.</seg>
<seg id="25"> So in addition to flour as well, for example in the case of eggs.)</seg>
<seg id="26"> If one takes a look, however, in the "napi" shopping basket, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price of the product is already in the previous year, even in the worst case by little more than 10 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Obviously are in a stronger position than the egg - after all, they could the drastic price increase pass on to the multinationals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> In the golden deplore the hypermarkets not; it is constantly about good years.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not look at the prices more.</seg>
<seg id="30"> From all large quantities bought, lasting food go in over the counters.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Wednesday morning there was in all three department stores endless with the cash as suddenly the number of customers exploded.</seg>
<seg id="32"> However, the country is a smaller frequency reports, so that many multinationals with complain, they could not even reach the planned turnover, and not only in the case of food, but also with lasting materials.</seg>

<seg id="6"> The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient, after a serious accident to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The patient was isolated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The injured a serious car accident was released from the hospital, a little later, the man had to return, however, with a mrsa-infection an important operation could since then, because of the, which is still in the body of the patient is not yet to be carried out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Until 10 December of this year from hospitals activated by virus infections initiated at the national nosocomialis surveillance system, as the leading doctor of the national,.</seg>
<seg id="11"> So many activated by virus released infections were registered certainly in the hospitals, the true figure may be higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were by the against methicillin-oxacillin of resistant triggered.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The staphylococcus (SA) bacterium contributes approximately one third of the people in their nose, without that it would cause an illness.</seg>
<seg id="14"> SA limited infections (such as inflammation of tonsillitis, inflammations of skin or wounds) usually react to antibiotics well, they are well curable.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24"> After this infection mainly in hospitals and homes for the elderly, the taken patients should investigate and mrsa-infected isolate immediately.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not, however, so frequently practised.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Last but not least because it on the part of the national health any subsidies for this investigation.</seg>
<seg id="27"> The most cases would come to light before then, if the patient is already a noticeable, according to the medical his of.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations to the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there are, however, also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be called microbiological studies are necessary, so that any resistance to the funds can form, however, this directive of hospitals, does not always adhered to.</seg>

<seg id="35"> The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds connected barely, although it is between them from the point of view of the epidemiological a distance of at least 1.5 meters should be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> As karolina keep saying, it happens unfortunately in financially less well placed hospitals, even before that, in the case of you, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors which almost favour the emergence of infections.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Political capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to the department of risk analysis (risk division) of political capital activities in this August with support for the "movement for a better Hungary" founded Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and the region in more respect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the ", the" of the institute it means among other things: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard represents the highest political risk the "increase the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and in Hungary, even at short notice to violent discussions could lead".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The main reasons for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, which probably on the provocation of such a discussion aims, so the Institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> How will this report as a failure on the part of the politically responsible persons regarded: "People of public life with representatives of the discussion of the radical political grouping, which now based their political strategy on the".</seg>
<seg id="6"> One assumes that this intensify the problem, the sensible dialogue impossible extremities as well as would increase the probability of violent arguments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The forschungsinsitut means, the activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad substantially, particularly regarding the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity concerns".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> We remember: since the fall of 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary continuously in the lift, so that, since the summer 2007 several "national association" calling organizations were founded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "these groupings in common that they each define as a civil organization, while it openly with the their members on - sometimes armed - tasks to prepare (national protection,), with reference to the unsuitability of the police, the army or the state, it was said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> And further: all this in accordance with the method which is different to the policies and of the population, based, political efforts as civil initiative to disguise.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The emphasis of the civilian character and the help that is not only the avoidance of legal hurdles in the course of the registration with the Court could emerge - it is also a political strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> As the analysis has to be taken from the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk factor, also for the relations with the States.</seg>
<seg id="13"> "in the last months of the Hungarian guard in several States as a potential source of so many quoted politician in certain countries, the origin of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of its own.</seg>
<seg id="14"> All this has effects on the political stability of the region - it was said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian guard is not, therefore, in the political risk of increased for the entire region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As reports, the activities of the Hungarian guard comparable with those of the Bulgarian national guard, whose establishment in August 2007 by the Bulgarian's National Union (bnu) was announced.</seg>
<seg id="17"> In the background to the emergence of the Bulgarian guard were the, which in a district of Sofia (krasna poljana) have taken place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The bnu has the incidents equal opportunity for the establishment of the national guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization of the "national protection".</seg>
<seg id="19"> In your opinion, namely in the last 17 years, a real "terror" in Bulgaria, the State remained however idle and indifferent, so political capital.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And further: the initiative would have an intense debate in the Bulgarian public kicked loose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As said that the increased risk for ethnic discussions will also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard purposes.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Since the activities of the Hungarian guard so far many similarities with those of the Bulgarian national guard shows, is it not exclude the fact that the Hungarian Roma also, with the organization of their own protection to the threats to react, it means in the risk of political capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Juhász Attila, in the case of political capital said on request of the report: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Every year would be published annually and should is recognizable tendencies, the public opinion informed, as in the case by the publication of the risk.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> In Hungary holidays are regulated legally exactly, so that the practice of working days around the holidays, established in the meantime, however, give us the coming year some such days.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Also in the European Union and in America, one means something different under "holiday".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and days.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Days are mostly church holidays or stand with important historical events in context.</seg>
<seg id="6"> We celebrate new year as well, for example: both the last day of the old, when the first day of the new year, are days - already so that the latter alone can rest.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the whole year we have a total of fourteen holidays.</seg>
<seg id="8"> These are the 15 March at the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On 20 August, the establishment of state, on 1 May the work celebrated on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Furthermore there are two holidays at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Since our Heads of State or religious holidays rarely on a weekend fall, the practice of the "," proved itself in the cases in which we before or after the holiday, only one day would work.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The price of the prolonged weekends, though, that we on Saturdays in front of work very well, or must go to school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> When this day before or after the holiday, you should at long last be processed, since long years by the Employment Minister in its own regulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The legislation applies to all employers and recipients, for public employees and officials of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Only companies and facilities are excluded, in which the company without interruption, therefore, also at the holidays, continued.</seg>
<seg id="16"> This year the rules only through the holidays, at the end of the year, is somewhat mixed up: from the 24th December remains in this country really do, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the specifically for adjustment taking holidays.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In the next year fall more within the holidays or at the end of the week, so that, at the working days will be less than this year.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The calendar is around the day of the work on the head, so that the people by four days now at home can remain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saturday, the 26 April a working day, so that the Friday, 2 May can be a day of rest.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The second change is connected with the holiday on 23 October, on Saturday, the 18 October will be one of the Friday, 24 first of all have to process.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Six as a deterrent, in order to annoy</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> E-mails which we forget, we never received - harmless lies, which we do not notice: they bring "," at work to the weekday.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The only question is whether one of these small used, or is it better to the challenge and tries to this misleading, aggravating for other situations.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Tips.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "sorry that I have forgotten to pass on to you that someone from the referred - a colleague says".</seg>
<seg id="6"> That it has missed a meeting?</seg>
<seg id="7"> At best, one regrets it and attempts to make it again to when one perhaps with the calls and admitting, one would have forgotten to align the report that is the usual way).</seg>
<seg id="8"> The thing is usually dismissed with an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Before one oneself in excuses, one should consider, with one of his colleagues can truly prepare unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Something lent, which does not belong to one?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> There is hardly a little pithier as if one according to a document or the telephone, but it is not there.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Yesterday was still on the desk - it is today?</seg>
<seg id="13"> Or will the believed lost ballpoint pens about on a colleague's desk?</seg>
<seg id="14"> No one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow, because they are annoyed if they find that something disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Therefore, no covers or mail from the office in the bag because they could meet: no more, since, if one 's but urgently needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Gossip about the private life of the colleagues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> There is no effective means, one of which has already been put in the world, to stop.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Who, with whom, which made?</seg>
<seg id="19"> Where, and why?</seg>
<seg id="20"> One should the information (or assumptions) on the private life of the colleagues if possible not to tie the nose!</seg>
<seg id="21"> And if someone opens and its internal secret tells us, we should not abuse this confidence!</seg>
<seg id="22"> The best one keeps quiet as a grave, instead of just is not present to adjust, even if other about the problems of the colleagues also know.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Without reason ill announced?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If one is in office in order to present itself ill with reference to tormenting headache report because one just feels uneasy, or simply would only like to rest, one should take a clear: the work of their own, urgent, projects with fixed dates must now the colleagues instead of a themselves.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore!</seg>
<seg id="26"> If one already knows at that one it at the next day do not get into office, or that something could interfere why one must remain at home, one should announce it in time, so that neither the colleagues, nor the boss unexpectedly confronted with the absence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Hum, tittering, telephoning</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> One is right in his work deepened, but you do giggle disturbed by the colleagues?</seg>
<seg id="29"> Unintentional a telephone conversation that one should not have heard better?</seg>
<seg id="30"> One should not the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (one over their heads,) moaning or permanent nerves.</seg>
<seg id="31"> All this can be very disturbing, even if it is not just in a task (write plan, organize) deepened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Are the other always to blame?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> A project is not ready in due time, one has a letter or important nachrichte, one should not forget to send the fault of its own forgetfulness not with other search!</seg>
<seg id="34"> As far as possible, one should not on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!</seg>
<seg id="35"> The best one admits his errors and excuses if others were affected by this as well!</seg>
<seg id="36"> The question of how one mistake again, or which missed retrieve can only too missed!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In the office - a feeling like to home?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Pants and schlapfen: force for at home, but in the office lost nothing!</seg>
<seg id="39"> Not even then one should so casually dress, if it would actually permit the job!</seg>

<seg id="8"> However, now one sees even the back-up differently, when one hears the new album of.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The appearance of to so many new and exciting production from the local digital underground contribute slowly to a change of the overall picture, and even if the garage, with its gitarrengequit again "," the domestic proves: there are new under the sun.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In pécs Balázs ranging, even in the volumes to before it, perhaps because a pub no two piper - its own path to follow.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The breakthrough with its project (zagar) and its music which elements from jazz, electronics and pop made it created, but only as one with the request the a film to compose it had approached (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="12"> "szezon" of Ferenc toeroek).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The formation, which was originally appeared in smaller clubs, was known to the wider public first as the magazine "wan2" their first album from the year 2002 among the top 50 local and zagar, together with the almost only to, even in the West trendsetter marketable.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Without a doubt, and its volume "trendy", it is, however, not interested in whether they also like to bear this brand.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The volume reacted as it: with a new, still better album.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The new published now with the title "cannot walk fly" could open up new paths for them, however, already the title expresses the desire for continuity with the pécser years.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The expression comes from the time when Balázs was still away with another band.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The airy, flying allusion would be in order, however, to fall apart from the character of the music - the time and the trend of appropriate louder the influences the rock 'n' roll.</seg>
<seg id="19"> With these songs living in England and with the volume of "the jigsaw puzzle" working singer himself with the premiere in presented.</seg>
<seg id="20"> A song from album it even to the created - has been one of early to pop music late "this pet the listeners with the number" of love ", the cooperation of six local singers (" ") was taken up gradually set.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Everything in order so (?).</seg>
<seg id="22"> The hvg.hu enquired at Balázs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Hvg.hu: this new raises the question: to what extent does your music reserved for a certain layer?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Balázs: the term "," I do not just mean much.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In my opinion, there are two classes in the pop music, and indeed not mainstream and or alternative and pop but commercial and honestly.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Even the so-called alternative or underground can shallow and meaningless, just as they can also, however, only for the sale produced, which makes it commercial music.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Even a good can arise from an honest motive.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The acceptance of listener functions independently according to this principle, independently of languages and borders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Hvg.hu: do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and of foreign public your music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> As zs. Abroad, particularly to the west of us the pop music has a greater tradition.</seg>
<seg id="31"> There is not only teenagers or on concerts, but also the older public.</seg>
<seg id="32"> They pursue the trends in the pop music which happen around them, much more, because they also for a part of the contemporary culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Hvg.hu: what role is the public with your work?</seg>
<seg id="34"> It is important, who, where, how many hear your music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As zs.: of course it is a good sense, to see that more and more to come to our concerts.</seg>
<seg id="36"> However, we have never for the market.</seg>
<seg id="37"> With us, music does not result in order to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The role of the public is usually marked with the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but there again only in the unreachable changes of the moment.</seg>
<seg id="39"> Nevertheless, one struck me: if you make it all right, you are not more interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Hvg.hu: how far you to follow the example of?</seg>
<seg id="41"> It is as away and his career in the West.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="42"> As zs. We don't really its way, quite apart from the time that one tries again and again, this in our music.</seg>
<seg id="43"> We see rather than on the musical presence of other trust and it unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="44"> Originally were naturally compare our work with that of to inevitable, as several of us come from his band and have taken another way.</seg>

<seg id="45"> Hvg.hu: in the wings of "wings of love" stands in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="46"> Many have only in connection with this number belonged to the names.</seg>
<seg id="47"> Was the opening with a somewhat scale in the direction of a wider audience conscious?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> As zs.: we had no plans to write a of the then shall suffer for the album as.</seg>
<seg id="49"> In this song, it is a matter of more.</seg>
<seg id="50"> It was considered as a final of the, with which we, the and the somewhat more difficult subjects wanted to dissolve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Hvg.hu: how have you the six selected?</seg>
<seg id="52"> Why is it, which was the guidance principle?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> As zs.: the idea was to make a gospel chorus.</seg>
<seg id="54"> Then came the idea, the chorus from talented soloists of the local music scene.</seg>
<seg id="55"> So sechsköpfige chorus resulted, therefore, for sena edina kutzora, péterfy, eniko "hodosi [neo], sena, -, then we apäter" "underground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> Hvg.hu: you have the song exactly the same, or do have it the girls?</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> As zs. Actually the musical none, it has been rather with more difficult tasks.</seg>
<seg id="73"> For example, in the case of "dorian Gray's dilemma", in which I on a play, or in the case of "rock 'n' roll goes to the girls, where the longer did not work, but gradually everything together, as in the case of a jigsaw puzzle.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, it is done.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The budget is approved.</seg>
<seg id="4"> What is special one at this budget?</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is the first budget which this government has designed and without support the opposition was accepted by the.</seg>
<seg id="6"> For the current year still with the support of the ssd (social democrats) approved because it Minister (of this party) had submitted, and it therefore could not allow to reject it.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no against the government nothing dramatic happened this time.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Parliament approved this traditionally considered, nevertheless, some highly meaningful law calmly.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This is to a certain extent paradoxical.</seg>
<seg id="10"> This rule begins and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the budget, whether one likes or not.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The budget is an essential component of the policy, however, is covered by the power of the government and the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="12"> This is a subject for the media, and therefore they devote more attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A fight among politicians is much more interesting for the public as a bare figures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The national budgets suffered at the last social democratic governments under three weak points, the budget for the year 2008, not at the same time can eliminate:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The first is the high proportion of expenditure, because of law obliging, whereby it is not only about the pensions, but also about social, the "implicit" coalition of ssd and ksm (Communist) in the last year before the choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The second is the account budget policy as a result of the first.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the deficits of the local authorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id="19"> This budget is public and eingermassen under control.</seg>
<seg id="20"> However, a true time bomb is the deficit of the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Many mayors distributed by except gains from taxes, and bank loans further sources for investments, often mostly bonds, through which they their in excess responsible.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In the last few years they managed to these debts by massive sales of stocks of energy and other supply networks, in which they had received from the State to pay off.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Now this source already dried up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> As far as we only at official and verifiable facts, we find that:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Our economy for some years, like the rest of the world, a growth through which the incessantly himself boasts.</seg>
<seg id="26"> This represented a unique opportunity for their governments, public finances in order.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Instead, these governments were to the state, however, still more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Pakistan, Albania or Egypt have much more reasonable than our Republic.</seg>
<seg id="29"> This is a giant disgrace, which mainly be ascribed to the former governments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> We are among the countries that, seen in the global scale, at least are threatened by poverty.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Therefore, no nassiven social which, unfortunately, just in the last few years very in gigantic extent was blown up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Even if it is successful, a part of the absurd populist expenditure, which were adopted this year before the elections, to delete if it is clear that in next time not to a shift of the pension entry age and to a pension, then virtually any policy in this country, and, all the same, who is in power, he will not have anything as pure administration.</seg>
<seg id="33"> It is only slightly exaggerated, if one says that then from the dominant politicians, civil servants are the largest part of the tax revenue mechanically on pensions and social divide.</seg>
<seg id="34"> Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but it can only the expulsion of normal expenditure by duty areas.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The planned for 2008 deficit of 70 billion Crowns would be quite superfluous if former governments not spent in the last ten years, which would have only worked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If we do not want that it really comes to that from the dominant politicians pure verwaltungsbeamte, then we must be patient and that is not too strong coalition government, however, which is conscious of the fact that the State, just as much as it can take to taxes and charges in the situation is, rest with the preparation of further wish.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> To tell the truth, I was never a special fan the Peugeot 206.</seg>
<seg id="3"> His were not much value, the quality of which refer to the control and also the processing, one could describe as rather below average.</seg>
<seg id="4"> But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, on the market, and this is much better.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The combination of with the name sw is still a piece of further, and it only remains for me to revise my opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As I had tested the classical hatchback 207, I had to me, for example, about the low on the rear seats.</seg>
<seg id="7"> There are now no longer these complaints, because the body combination is formed in such a way that not even suffer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Fast further</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> I have only just go through, in order not to repeat me too much.</seg>
<seg id="10"> It is a quite excellent design, where I only because of the miserable central tunnel's objections.</seg>
<seg id="11"> There I would welcome a little more designerische organization, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The seats are comfortable and are the times past, where we perhaps have to short seats or.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Also, in comparison with the 206 substantially.</seg>
<seg id="14"> What the space concerns here, one can also feel the increased dimensions of the body.</seg>
<seg id="15"> In combination is also the already mentioned the lack of eliminated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the trunk suitcases</seg>

<p>
<seg id="17"> The main point at this car is, however, the cargo hold.</seg>
<seg id="18"> I must now also because of the reverse) as a very good loadable and space-saving.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The cavities are equipped with safety belts, which represent an ideal compromise.</seg>
<seg id="20"> They do not disturb can and do even more difficult objects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> However, we talk about the drawer volume.</seg>
<seg id="22"> It is according to table in the basic equipment 428 in comparison with the competition, which is a rather average value.</seg>
<seg id="23"> However, not in comparison with the vehicle of this class, the? fabia,.</seg>
<seg id="24"> If we have the 207 1.6 with the new generation of product from Mladá Boleslav compare, we find that the Peugeot by clearly perceptible 52 behind.</seg>
<seg id="25"> For a foreign vacation or when inviting a buggy this value is already critical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But in order to emphasize the positiva, I must still the according to the whole of the down mention turning back seats or even the very low mention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> 120 transportation in four numbers</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> It was with a capacity of 1.6 litres and with an output of 88 equipped.</seg>
<seg id="29"> And, frankly, should look like a family, a family.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It is low, has a low consumption and moves away well.</seg>
<seg id="31"> If I compare him with his counterpart at Skoda, which sometimes seems as if its with a rag clogged, then I can only be inspired by him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The price list speaks volumes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The price of this car is not just national.</seg>
<seg id="34"> However, we must remember that we have a good car equipped with a spacious innneren and a very good engine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> The basic price of cars with the 1400th petrol engine at the level of 329900 crowns still concerns.</seg>
<seg id="36"> With our engine it costs as 410900 Crowns which is already quite a lot.</seg>
<seg id="37"> The equipment of the strikes once again with 80000 crowns besides.</seg>
<seg id="38"> We had, however, automatic air bags, automatic windshield wiper electrical window lifters back and and...</seg>
<seg id="39"> So the car costs in total simple 531900 crown.</seg>
<seg id="40"> That is a lot, but you calculate the options of a fabia once and they will arrive with a very similar sum.</seg>

<seg id="1"> What insurance is suitable for me the best?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The insurance, a possible claim caused by the driver covers, contains a high cost, whose level of various factors depends, among other things, of age, sex, the time of the creation of the driving licence, kind of the insured, cars and its use, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> To have a car is only the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Because it is even more difficult to find the fitting motor vehicle insurance as the right vehicle model.</seg>
<seg id="5"> First, it must be clear to one with which we have to do it here.</seg>
<seg id="6"> A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This agreement is in writing by means of a versicherungsvertrags held, which specifies that the society receives and in exchange is engaged in a claim the corresponding compensation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The premium is the price of an insurance consists through several factors, and other age, sex, the time of the creation of the driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The insurance companies determine their prices according to the statistics, so that, in the event of a higher danger of accident, even higher payments due.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> For this reason both via women make less payments, because statistics prove that these groups, thanks to their caution show a lower accident rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The same also applies to married people, since these after statement of the statistical values and therefore also for being one of the enterprise, fewer accidents tend as singles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The use of the vehicle is attributed to influences the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The more frequently the use, the more probable the damage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> With the installation of the insurance premium must consider a whole series of points.</seg>
<seg id="15"> For this reason the driver must also study the situation thoroughly exactly the car insurance to select the most likely approaches his personal needs.</seg>
<seg id="16"> We do this now, the most important points, the one with the selection of an insurance should take into account, in order not only an achievement - but also a oriented choice to be able to meet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The less than 25-year-old meetings with the choice of a reasonably priced insurance numerous obstacles, such as the small and the "young" driving licence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Even if it is for an ideal insurance cover best would be a sign, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The careful drivers can select a full hull with, so that the services of a were covered, but at a low price offered.</seg>
<seg id="20"> This type of contract contains that the customer a portion of the amount resulted from the damage must pay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The amount is before the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the premium; this is more highly the smaller the sum to explain Luis Noguera, main agent of Spain with Europe, an arrangement for on-line.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Another option is the extended insurance, the customer against external damages, however, against the damages developed at the own car.</seg>
<seg id="23"> In addition to this kind of insurance theft, fire and vehicle loss.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Here is a piece of advice.</seg>
<seg id="25"> If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hand to lower the cost of insurance; so your credit increases by trying to travel and to avoid accidents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> A credit is a reduction in the case of the appropriate insurance company.</seg>
<seg id="27"> In the opposite to contain a payment an increase of said rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The amount of credits and punishing payments depend on the society and their returns.</seg>
<seg id="29"> If the enterprise a rich year behind it, can allow itself to increase, explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> As soon as the exceeded it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing the accident rate sinks.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Therefore, it is the most sensible for a full with deduction to decide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Usually the young people can not profit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident as at the time of the driving not to describe the practice of the European enterprise, and adds that the majority of the accidents in the second occur after the fear of beginner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Nevertheless, it is in the case of a married customers, who does not possess children a sign; of course, only then, if it is the financial situation of the appropriate person also allows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> On the part of married couples with children as the customers with the lowest accident rate, and correspondingly low also their payments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> In this case, would be a fully with deduction (at an amount around 300 Euros.), the best option in the case that one received a high credit, recommends an extended insurance, the first for the third year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> You go in total relaxed and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to a larger contribution payment determine Luis Noguera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> It is good for pensioners, with a full deduction (at an amount around 150 euro), or an extended insurance which does only at a sufficiently high credit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Finally, one must observe that the car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible, but also because it high costs, which require it, that a thorough choice is made, which corresponds to our personal situation.</seg>

<seg id="4"> None of the questions on Wednesday evening, the 28 November, were raised, as ridiculous as the snowman the Democrats about the global warming in the debate of the other party.</seg>
<seg id="5"> However, the questions and answers reflected this time exactly the condition of the Republican Party which bursts in the elections next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It is not known, exactly as the producers of CNN, the debate, the selected the candidates to selected the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, in the first half hour of debate, the longest was dedicated to a single topic was immigration in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The CNN asked a group of manipulate voters to operate a if they heard things which they liked: the television noticed points of the agreement as the candidates strictly across the borders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between rudy Giuliani, the national outrider, and romney, the crucial inquiries in Hampshire and new pushed forward.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Giuliani attempts to shake off the call, it is flexible with regard to illegal immigration, when he was mayor of New York.</seg>
<seg id="12"> He attacked romney in it the former governor of Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for working on its House.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The two stopped especially hard as questioners asked whether one of the candidates, a "Amnesty" (illegal a regular status and the way in which citizenship would give) would support.</seg>
<seg id="14"> More insignificant candidates as Duncan hunter, a representative, and Tom tancredo, a representative from Colorado, in the case of this topic.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Neither of the two men has serious chances in the case of the nomination, but both of them remain in running, perhaps because they use and harder than other on which have hit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At least in the field of immigration, the candidates and the same opinions: sharper borders, intolerance illegal migrants.</seg>
<seg id="17"> This subject, together with fears about toxic toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world, to help the Republicans, the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives to forget or to minimize.</seg>
<seg id="18"> But the debate was obviously problematic as other topics for the language.</seg>

<seg id="20"> John McCain and romney discussed this, whether in regard should be regarded as torture.</seg>

<seg id="23"> A further questioners asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="24"> MIKE huckabee - now, contrary to all expectations in the first place, in a recent survey carried out in this one, owing to its Christian conservativism existing for a long time - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The labour pains</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Gordon Brown has yet another pit for falling; his way out of this remains the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.</seg>
<seg id="4"> No titles seem to have been sold politician Paris paid hotel bills toes, not to have been.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But the revelation that a rich businessman ruling for the British Labour Party on more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people disguised and that the party failed to announce this is something without which the disputed Gordon Brown well would have managed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When two months ago the Prime Minister of the demand for a choice had escaped way the intelligence of the British insulting when he said that public opinion polls, this decision would not have affected, there was hope that it would offer a robust, efficient government.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Instead, as vince, the increasingly astute agency chairmen of the Liberal Democrats, it expressed the brown feared once of Stalin bean developed.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The clumsy rescue of northern rock, a hit Bank weakness and bad discernment judgement under fire.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Badly thought out proposals to change the tax set against the government applied.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The loss of personal data of 25 million people showed inconceivable administrative.</seg>
<seg id="11"> A trio of generals in retirement started a revolt in protest against the Upper House of military: to be Secretary of the armed forces, so you have claimed a partial.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Now there are the various contributions of David Abrahams; Peter this labours Secretary-General (and their former fulfilment leader) has already resigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> This means that brown breaks the direction of open.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point, after which they feel it impossible to govern.</seg>
<seg id="15"> People still being allowed to trust politicians, but do they usually back their scepticism, if a new force takes the office.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister to improve the situation, and it does not even need to be long, this delay is past: the public service starts to become leaky; the cabinet ministers begin to; the press looks for bad news; and the government is defensive and secretaries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In a way, the position of brown is particularly difficult, because he, in contrast to other political leaders cannot claim to be a new broom.</seg>
<seg id="18"> So with pleasure it Tony Blair would deny that it was his.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The problems with northern rock and which, for example, hang together with decisions, the brown made as a Chancellor of the Exchequer.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And even if not directly involved in the misfortunes - as in the case of the "money for nobility" of a political party financing, the voters assume possibly, that he was it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In spite of that situation is not quite as bad as it looks</seg>
<seg id="22"> The misdemeanours are not so terrible as the Conservatives describe it.</seg>
<seg id="23"> As in the case of bean, nobody died or completely.</seg>
<seg id="24"> And the remedy, painful as it may be, is to be delivered, which of course Stalinist tendencies always promised: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The new fuss about political contributions is a good example.</seg>
<seg id="26"> The garboeske Abrahams its contributions with its gifts beneficial to the public, says he wants no public recognition for its goodwill.</seg>
<seg id="27"> That may be so, but perhaps the decision it wasn't entitled to it.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The laws against anonymity for great political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy entrance to those who govern the country.</seg>
<seg id="29"> This says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, but not the fact that it is illegal, will of course have to put some questions; just as labours main finance which over the separate contributions in October were told.</seg>
<seg id="30"> But so far brown not involved: there is nothing that indicates that he knew about this confusion, although the largest part of the payments after taking office in June was made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> So far the Prime Minister finished half of the work.</seg>
<seg id="32"> He has quickly the violation of the law by his party, but he diluted this determination by reaching after a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - led, in order to make the measure full of a bishop in retirement and a judge.</seg>
<seg id="33"> In this instance, the "it to be pulled out" not very complicated.</seg>
<seg id="34"> If the law were broken, it is a matter for the police.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown must, as something of a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in public life, to find the vacant for six months, and to make progress with a radical reform of a political party financing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> This would require the labour of the hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps the special financial relationship with the trade unions which - bitter pills for a party Member, as Mr Brown.</seg>
<seg id="37"> But it should be conscious of some partial facts.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The Conservatives have a clear direction now in the opinion polls; it has two years to recover voters; and the only way it can reach a victory, is through indisputable and Sturdy competence.</seg>

<seg id="1"> England confronted with decision about the statements of owais Shah and</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the others.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Who is as number 6 for England in kandy at this weekend, owais Shah or ravi,?</seg>
<seg id="4"> And not less relevant in a broader context than the first test to Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second question is important because the David youthful, on call at least under this specific title, is here, about the Peter bog and the captain Michael Vaughan to help to decide, and because of the table of high morries, the English managing director, gradually, with applications for national fills, if not even for what in part-time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Whoever does not get the sixth will be unfortunate, but that life is often unfair and sport, it is beyond doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It is never easy to nail exactly what a human being made it possible to reach the point of his profession, while someone else about the lowest rank, sometimes from lack of luck instead of capability.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is not only necessary in, where the choice is difficult, where judgments which are always at the end of subjective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Is it the right time for, gross?</seg>
<seg id="10"> It is fair to Shah if he does it?</seg>
<seg id="11"> The same can perhaps also in a wider area be asked whether, for example, John Edward "or", both intelligent young with good conclusions, the business well knows, should be promoted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Who can say what the right class for a one-day, unless it the possibility given to sink or swim.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Of course numbers have a big influence on decisions, but are also have this.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Within a team must a one-day the eye of the captain at the right time catch, if it can take a and a bat must regular opportunities on the right, if it wants to do impression as a one-day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The eyes of the to catch is more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="16"> There were many who in the last season better than, for example, as James Anderson were apparent in the first test will play, even if Stephen pronounces itself for healthy and as the wind in the networks.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Anderson included 32 Prime wickets per 33 to earn a position in this route.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Chris tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their points and hope to still more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Whether Shah or, in the asgiriya stage is, can only be.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The choice could decide the careers of both men, or perhaps, however, it makes little difference.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Four years ago in Sri Lanka played Gareth batty in each test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and useful to 40, it was, however, Paul, then still fightingly in order to consolidate the breakthrough to a significant testkricketspieler created and, although it is a double one hundred against in Australia, perhaps still underestimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> It is probable that youthful Vaughan and moorland, after a further discussion in the course of the present in the asgiriya stage their conservative instincts and's greater experience about net enthusiasm will follow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> There are arguments for both of them.</seg>
<seg id="24"> For Shah speak its sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds, and only six of the seven years younger with 22 years, and an excellent balance against bullets.</seg>
<seg id="25"> However, Shah made only ten runs in its two innings in May against the West in the test in Lord, its as a player from middlesex, and this, plus its immediate rejection of the as Vaughan was well, about his position for the next game, seems to take back the momentum from its suggest to have taken the still in Bombay was obvious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In contrast, the Jack of all trades from Essex Essex.</seg>
<seg id="27"> It is of no one impressed and its attitude off this was taken to the point when he recently with a vehicle in an exhibition for England sponsor Volkswagen had estimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> He suffered from smaller injuries and probably a shock, but first, which he did was to be Vodafone (of course also gesponsort) out and its Cook ask who had observed this from the distance and with enthusiasm to say: "have you seen this?".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> , is a much better, be it with some effect here on the grounds, which seems to match it and, with confidence and destiny.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The right man to select a thing is the right time to choose a different.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Perhaps that is the art of the real choice.</seg>
<seg id="32"> In addition, I incline its chance now to give, which does not mean that maybe Shah well sentence is not, however, if, as the from Ceylon suggests, it is that, will play here this weekend.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Richard is simply not cynically enough</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> With "the party" and "dreadful peace" two films deal again with Balkan war.</seg>
<seg id="3"> But both do not.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Either the drafts put too much on action and geballer or else they are to blessed.</seg>
<seg id="5"> There also Richard in "the party did not help.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The good news first: did not hide the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still in the mountains of the Balkans, but just there, in the dark hinterland of, is now the actors Richard been found again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> We had the most beautiful man of the years finally lost sight of, because too many roles in for women and too many press conferences on the subject films, the desire to well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Richard is suddenly the most important argument, "the party - if the hunter to gejagten is" (why, today, really must always be so long and as?), perhaps, but to look at.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It provides a perfect representation: in fact taken its Simon, which could have become from, if the destiny and the not so reporter who would be: a man, its very best times long behind itself, however, even as a monument its fall still considerable remains of the former themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But in spite of this, "the party", together with the German production "dreadful peace", which also starts in this week, only the endless series of failed continues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "dreadful peace" one can make short process: the film is of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian topol, Max riemelt), a Kosovo from save on the one this also falls in love with them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although it is welcome that here is not the root of all evil Serbs as exclusive are represented, loses the film too quickly in geballer and action.</seg>
<seg id="13"> It remains a kind of "alarm for 11" without motorway but for with war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> On the other hand, can be on "the party" almost exemplary, why it did not actually ever a correct good has given.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The history of three, which set out by the Serbian "," the fox to trace criminal with another director and another (both in scriptwriter Richard shepard) to another time perhaps a new "now".</seg>
<seg id="16"> Because the stories are alike yes: go both male small teams in the forest, in order to achieve something which the soldiers not able and both times it becomes a journey in the madness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> One of the reasons for the failure of "the party", Simon that one is not simply the shabby cynic with heart when he presented to us at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18"> No, the script must it in addition still a romantic affair, with a later murdered Muslim.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Finally, "the party" go then the brook down if the reporters within the last five minutes succeed in the CIA which NATO, and all of the world in five years: the war criminal catch and the Muslim Bosnians for fair revenge left.</seg>
<seg id="20"> This is so bad that one of the International Court of Justice in The Hague because of crimes against the call would like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The film has a deeply human concerns.</seg>
<seg id="22"> He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still freely, and he suspects, the Americans and the French (here they should agree for once) due to the pursuit of secret political arrangements too intensively to operate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But this well and the bad are sometimes so similar to that a famous comes into the sense.</seg>
<seg id="24"> It is called it over the wood an Asian demon on the workbench of the poet: "sympathetically I see the swollen: how hard it is to be bad".</seg>
<seg id="25"> Films as "the party" exactly such swelling heads, however, indicate how hard it is to be good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The problem is not limited to the category of the limited.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Recently in this newspaper reports that all Iraq films were large flops.</seg>
<seg id="28"> One can also add: there has never been a good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Nearly always applies: if a star on the elements or mine fields of the world, then something like this out as "Rangoon" with Patricia arquette "beyond all borders" with "or" blood diamonds with Leonardo dicaprio.</seg>
<seg id="30"> All the conflicts are possibly temporary simply still to close.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood with "Schindler's list of" a good film about the Holocaust could turn.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Some film will probably still mature - which now as a classic geltenden "the", "now" or "author" full jacket are really not unanimously been celebrated as masterpieces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> But perhaps we know today, where everyone mass murder in real time on the same two screens amounts at home also simply too much about the conflicts in the world.</seg>
<seg id="34"> And that robs the of the, which needs to tell good stories.</seg>
<seg id="35"> "existence or" or "of the great dictator" are, after all, therefore, as well as well, because lubitsch and Chaplin do not yet know how badly the regime really prevailed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Perhaps one may not want to be good if one wants to make good films.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Perhaps the artist look of the Lawrence Norfolk.</seg>
<seg id="38"> As to parallels between its historical novel "lemprières dictionary" and Balkan war was questioned, he answered: "that is only because some things never change.</seg>
<seg id="39"> Cities are always terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in dreadful way and always will be war in Yugoslavia.</seg>
