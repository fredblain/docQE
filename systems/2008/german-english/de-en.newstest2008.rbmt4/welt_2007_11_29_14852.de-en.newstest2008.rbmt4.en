The fathers of the herbal rock return
Supergroup of Germany of the seventy-year-olds makes music again: Three tape members of Harmonia planned for her consoles with a concert in Berlin once more.
To the revival a recording from her big time " appears Live in 1974 ".
Even then they were substantially more famous abroad.
Then the fixed sensation occurs in the form of three sedate men in the evening board.
Everybody has his small box before itself, his cables and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits enthroned in the snow-white shirt at the age of 63 years in the middle.
On the left flanks from Michael Rother, 57 years young and in the possession of laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the lecture hall looks, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 curves, concentrates in the console.
Everybody contributes noises, every now and then even a beat.
And sometimes it submits by mistake to a customary piece of music.
Then this also seems to disturb men even not largely.
The fact that the volume Harmonia makes music again, has provided among herbal rock-lovers for some excitement.
And one may reveal here: Specific inquiries proved that the name whirred, indeed, through the collective pop memory, but by no means so with lasting effect to miss this tape for 32 years painfully.
But why should the German not be allowed to celebrate also his living legends from the seventies?
Particularly as that what calls delusively herbal rock, counted in England and America always more than in own land.
When the music economy lent to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003 the echo price of life work, one saw in the hall in questioning German pop faces.
As the Red Hot chilli Peppers to itself in the eulogy still with the volume La Dusseldorf and Anew! thanked, the surprise knew no borders.
With concerts Michael Rother crouched later with the Red Hot chilli Peppers on the stage like an old pal.
Away from home that is the problem of the ignorance at home and the transfiguration one.
The memory is demanded too much if only for that with Harmonia because the trio only two years existed and unfolded in this time also a far lower effect power than them afterwards from others was assigned.
Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler already before under the promising name Cluster.
At first one played in the cellar under the Berlin show stage.
Afterwards in Dusseldorf, for economic reasons for one flat label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out with power station and afterwards as a guitarist with Anew!, the German group most radical maybe at that time, a call wins.
However, about 1973 Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile after forest in the Weser mountainous country.
There, in the old Weser court, ruins from the 16-th century, they lived as a town-brief Kommunarden.
Less ideologically than in the local authority district I where might slave Roedelius still as a nanny.
Rather in spitzweghaftem artist's existence.
Supposedly a pennon of the song association Harmonia Ottenstein and for the art a name was also found in the bulky refuse.
Something held on Harmonia of it.
The first album called " music of Harmonia " and the following "De Luxe".
Since thus let and give the music also sounded, the tape suffered material need.
The brushwood collecting served not only the Selbstfindung.
The CD appeared now " Live in 1974 " was recorded with a concert in Griessem, before a just 50-headed record scenery, as somebody believes to remember.
At that time from Rother came the wish to force Harmonia and to practice now and then.
For Roedelius and Moebius an indecent demand.
The tape explained in 1975 her separation.
Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and protected itself his existence with albums like " blazing hearts ".
Cluster was animated in the eighties again and is more successful since that time than it was Harmonia ever.
The Griessemer live album is to be owed to Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer.
His record company Greenland has sat down it to the purpose to maintain the herbal rock as a very own German contribution to the living music.
Anew! besides, it was already dug out like Roedelius solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world.
Publicly subsidized, within the scope of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the Briton, old punk and author of the manual " herbal rock of sampler ".
There the Love Parade inventor Dr. is also a moth.
With which the whole range of the influence of the herbal rock on the following pop music would be outlined.
Besides, the empty place of the supergroup is filled by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most strange sounds in the hall: " The only true music, you hear the future. "
There are pictures which show the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse parlour.
Projections of other black-and-white photos of chaotically cabled tools serve the laying education.
Before it three veterans are occupied with the improvisation again.
No more, while they stick microphones to the organ and in the percussion to draw incredible tones of the instruments over self-tinkered effect devices.
Today the electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tinkerers detailed in the technical.
The choir of the house also changes nothing in it.
Under the management of Barbara Morgensterns it is coughed under sound clouds and is whispered and at a nice place with emphasis " Aaaaaaaah! " chanted.
Herbal rock was always a very English concept.
It never concerned rock.
The roots were searched less in blues, than in colleges of music (Can), technologies (power station) or on the run before artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Who here " in '68! " shouts, is not wrong completely, and Harmonia can be brought by it also now not from the rest.
Still the most natural is roofed on the stage thoroughly.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob one of the nerves or give brief moments of big luck.
