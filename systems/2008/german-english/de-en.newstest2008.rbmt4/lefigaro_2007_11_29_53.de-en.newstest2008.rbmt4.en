Spectacular repair in the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his companions of the occupying of the international space station (eat) more than seven hours will have used in the space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific works on the station.
A risqué climbing out which has achieved on account of his duration, the distance of inhabitable modules, the quickness with which he was organized and to carry out which from the astronauts gebastelten  tools, in order the repair several records.
The problem appeared on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the space shuttle Discovery, a big cylinder-shaped part which should soon take up the European and Japanese scientific labs.
This module is a kind of landing stage for the module labs.
But one must be able to supply them with stream.
It was the second task of the occupying, a 17.5 metric tons module to the stream production about solar collectors which was already on the International Space Station, to move to bring it in his final position.
After she had moved it, the occupying came along to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module whose span amounts to 76 meters.
And, besides, it happened that one of the collectors which can be opened up like Akkordeone was damaged by a stuck cable on a length by chance to a meter
The restructuring was stopped not to damage the collector even more.
The astronauts who leave originally for a controlling way the space shuttle Discovery and then another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty should repair, felt constrained to devote itself to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected, at the end of the 30 meter long remote control arm of the space shuttle which had been attached in that of the station, to walk to carry out the repair.
He is one best Spacewalker  (Wetraumgänger) of the NASA.
Largely, resistantly, very much skillful, he has a well developed upper part of the body and long arms.
The 46-jähirige qualified doctor was selected, verletzten  solar collector to operieren .
After he had exactly examined the damages, he split the faulty cable and fastened a kind of rails on the damaged place.
He was supported from second Spacewalker  which remained near the sluice, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the occupying.
The tools which he used a mini-hockey stick, in insulator wraps to prevent an electric blow on the solar collectors which generate several hundred volts, the astronauts had thought up aboard the station and gebastelt .
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited, until the collector was opened up completely, before he counted his tools and returned in the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts half a day of relaxation enjoyed, before today seven astronauts on the space shuttle Discovery returned to start the return flight to the earth probably Wednesday.
