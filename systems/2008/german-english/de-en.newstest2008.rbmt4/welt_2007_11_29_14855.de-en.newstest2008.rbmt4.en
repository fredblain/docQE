From Beust criticism harvests for Olympia-Absage
Moving away the mayor of the application of Hamburg for Olympic summer plays has bumped with policy and economy into violent criticism.
Many further want to fight for the plays in the water.
However, from Beust realism sends a reminder by the appraisal of the chances.
The general manager of the chamber of commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called on Wednesday a renunciation as " not well for the economic location ".
No other project has recently unfolded so big motivation forces in the town like the Olympic idea.
" Without this purpose the sports-political swing would not be able to be maintained in the same litre of beer. "
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate not to bury the project, but to find for it a new long-term beginning, " that goes out from a changed time ray ".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements after which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are unrealistic at least up to 2028.
" Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic sports alliance ", said from Beust WELT online.
He referred to the decision expected for beginning of December of the sports alliance about an application of Munich for the Winter Olympics in 2018.
" This preference means for us that we will have no realistic chances in the period angedachten up to now from us till 2028. "
The dream is not still for all time ausgeträumt, said from Beust.
The Hamburg sports alliance (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
The impression is thereby woken that Hamburg wants to apply during the next 25 years no more for Olympic games.
" It is too early to obstruct a chance to themselves, while one buries the plans already at that time ", said HSB president Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
Besides, a renunciation of the application stands in the contradiction to the statement of the senate boss on the occasion of a receipt to the plenary assembly of the general German university sport federation.
There the application of Hamburg has not called from Beust for the Universiade in 2015 " substitute " with Olympic games in Hamburg.
The university sport federation had nominated only last week Hamburg as an applicant's town.
The SPD-citizens faction accused the senate of not having used valuable time for the house building in Hamburg.
" For years the development of the small Grasbrooks has been delayed by the senate because he has placed on the map Olympia and has ignored the house building ", said SPD-delegated Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While SPD has always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later residential use for the small Grasbrook, the CDP has placed unilaterally on the "event factor".
The application for the Olympic summer plays in 2012 had released in Hamburg at that time a big enthusiasm.
However, Hamburg had failed because of Leipzig.
