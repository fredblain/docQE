England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of it almost as difficultly as the other.
Who should hit as a number 6 for England in Kandy on this week-end, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka who should meet the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral chairperson, on call is at least under this special title, here to decide to help of coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan in it, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing manager, bit by bit with applications fills for national electoral offices, if not even for which in partial time.
Whoever the sixth racquet position does not agree, will be unhappy, but the life is often unfair and the sport is indubitable it.
It is never easy, precise to nail what enables a person to reach the point of his branch of profession, while not everyone never comes out about the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the choice is difficult where judgments are necessary which are subjective always at the end.
Is it to be climbed up the right time for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he acts?
The same one can be asked maybe also in another area whether, for instance, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both the intelligent young executives should be carried with good end which know the business well.
Who can say what is the right class for a cricketer, unless, to him the possibility is given, to swim or to set.
Naturally figures have a big influence on decisions, but chances also have this.
Within a team a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain at the right time if he can take a Wicket and a racquet must get regular chances on the order if he wants to do impression as a one-day cricketer.
To catch the eyes of the Auswähler is more complex.
There were many, which in the last season better than, for example, when James Anderson were who will apparently play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explains himself for healthy and how the wind bowls in the nets.
Anderson took 32 high-class Wickets with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 by the same modest average, but both had her highlights and hope on even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara in the Asgiriya stage plays, only one view question can be.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it does maybe, nevertheless, little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, nevertheless, with five Wickets and runs with 40 useful, it was Paul Collingwood to strengthen at that time still fighting around himself which created the breakthrough to a significant test cricketer and who, although he dotted a double Hundred against Australia in Australia, is maybe still underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and moor, after an other discussion in the course of the today's net meeting in the Asgiriya stage will follow her conservative instincts and belly feeling for Shahs bigger experience about Boparas youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah his sparkling and valuable 88 Test-Debüt-Innings speaks in Bombay, 43 high-class hundreds and only six of Bopara which is younger at the age of 22 years seven years and an excellent balance against turned on balls.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two Innings in the May against west Indies in the test in lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate refusal of the Auswählern was healthy as a Vaughan to take back his position for the next play, seems to have taken the swing from his hitting which was still evident in Bombay.
By contrast the Alleskönner from Essex has shovel-wise joy of life.
He is impressed by nothing on a cricket place and his posture apart of it was summed up when he had recently skipped a vehicle with 4-bicycle impulse in an exhibit for sponsor of England Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and presumably a shock, but the first what he did, his Vodafone (of course also gesponsort) was to be got out and to call his team colleague Alastair Cook who had observed this from a distance and to say with enthusiasm: " Have you seen this? ".
Bopara is a lot of better player, he bowls his middle tempo with some effect here on the fields what seems to fit to him and hits with confidence and talent.
The right man is to be chosen a thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe this is the real art of the choice.
Now I bend to it Bopara to give his chance what does not mean that, nevertheless, Shah will not well maybe stand there if, as the tea sentence from Ceylon suggests, he is that which will play here this week-end.
