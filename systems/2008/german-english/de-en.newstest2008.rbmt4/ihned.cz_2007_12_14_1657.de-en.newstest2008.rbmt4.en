However, since June they sank by 13.4 billions.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed with it his information about the national debts from beginning of October.
A guilt of 84,000 crowns is cancelled to every Czech.
About the whole last year the state got into debt around more than 111 Miliarden crowns.
" Till present it seems that we will cross the border of a trillion crowns possibly thanks to the lower deficit for the next year only in 2009.
The next year the debts should move between 900 billions and a trillion crowns, " said David Marek, analyst of the Patria Finance, to the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly it sees Vladim√≠r Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance: " To the excess of a trillion we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next household which we do not know yet.
If should appear that the situation on the political stage changes, and the politicians should be ready more to save, could last up to 2010.
But from such a change I do not go out, " he noted.
Debts grow
The national debt is due to the debts of the state government and comes above all from the accumulation of deficits of the budget.
The national debt is financed by treasure instructions, state debentures, direct loans or, for example, by loans of the European investment bank.
The home state indebtedness rose this year meanwhile on 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debts of the state rose meanwhile by 1.7 billion crowns on 123.3 billions.
The so-called national debt capable of market reached billions crowns at the end of September, 803.3 and sank since June by 13.7 billions.
The average maturity of the national debts rose for 6.5 years.
" The whole guilt rose about the year from first up to the third quarter by 13 percent what is really a lot in view of that how well it goes for the economy.
It is interesting that the taking is to be registered above all with the debentures where the increase amounts to 20 percent.
It is bad that the debts rise, but then this shows that one can undertake something, already before the pension reform comes, " commented Pikora the data.
Better than expects
From the financing strategy and the contact with the national debts for 2007 it arises that the government had planned for this year to take up 159.2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December the ministry thanks to the better development of the state Hauhaltspolitik reduced the plan, nevertheless, on 152.8 billion crowns.
This amount is due above all to the state budget deficit which will reach obviously 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billions this year.
Further it concerns at most included in the plan means for the consolidation agency at the rate of 13.3 billion crowns, a 10 billions reserve to the payment of the pensions, the financing of state debentures for 43 billions and rates for the loans at the European investment bank at the rate of 1.8 billions.
