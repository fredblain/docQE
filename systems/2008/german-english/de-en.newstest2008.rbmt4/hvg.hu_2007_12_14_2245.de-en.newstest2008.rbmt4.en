Six deterrent little things to annoy colleagues
E-mails, to send off we forgotten, linguistic news which we never receive - harmless lies which do not strike us at all: They bring "color" in the everyday life in the workplace.
The question is bare whether one gets used to this small inconvenience, or one better positions himself to the challenge and tries these ambiguous, for other irritating situations consciously to vermweiden.
Tips.
" Sorry, I have forgotten to aim to you that somebody has called of the marketing department " - a colleague says.
The fact that one has thereby missed a meeting?
At best one regrets it and tries to make up for it, while one maybe calls with the marketing department and confesses remorseful, one would have forgotten to straighten the news (this is the less usual method).
The thing with an excuse is mostly dismissed.
Before one gets entangled in embarrassing excuses, one should consider with which one can prepare really disagreeable moments for his colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
A little bit lent what belongs to itself?
There is barely something more irritating, as if one reaches for a document, office accessories, or the phone, however, it is not there.
Yesterday the stapler still lay on the desk - today early it is away?
Or is he discovered lost believed ballpoint pens possibly on the desk of a colleague?
Without one should ask himself nothing of the colleagues lend, because they are annoyed rightly if they find out that something has got away.
Thus, no envelope or Post-its from the office in the pocket are, because it could meet one itself: nothing more there if one needs it, nevertheless, urgently.
Getratsche about the private life of the colleagues?
There are no effective means to detain a gossip which was already put in the world.
Who with whom, what done?
Where and which is why?
One should bind the information (or supposition) about the private life of the colleagues as far as possible not to everybody to the nose!
And if, nevertheless, somebody opens and betrays to us his most internal secret, we should not abuse this trust!
Best of all one is quiet like a grave instead of straightening the just not person present, even if other about the problems of the colleague also know.
Without reason ill announced?
If one calls in the office to announce himself with reference to tantalizing headaches ill because one feels just unwell, or just would like to rest, one should be about one in the clear: Now own work, unpushable open executions, projects with steady appointments must do the colleagues instead of itself.
Colleagues join in not horribly!
If the day before one knows already that one will not create it the next day in the office, or that something could interfere, why one must stay at home, one should announce it on time, so that neither the colleagues, nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Gesumme, giggling, phoning
One is deepened just in his work, it is disturbed, however, suddenly by the loud giggling of the colleagues?
Unintentionally a telephone call listened which one should not better have heard?
One should irritate the colleagues not with sums, singing, loud conversations (which one leads over her heads away), trampling, to durable cursing or grumbling.
All that can be very annoying, even if they write not exactly in a task (, plan, organize) are deepened.
Are the others to blame always?
If a project is not ready in time, one has forgotten an important letter or important directing to send off, one should not search the guilt of own forgetfulness with others!
As far as possible one should not unburden himself on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
Best of all one admits his mistakes to himself, and apologizes, if other were also concerned by it!
The question, as one make up for the mistake, or the missed can make up, is only much too right!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Tracksuit bottoms and Schlapfen: However, comfortably for at home, nothing has lost in the office!
Then one should not even dress so casually if it the workplace admitted, actually!
Only do not become too sloppy - one should his colleagues, as well as respect himself so far that one dresses in the office accordingly - if desirably, also nicely and elegantly!
