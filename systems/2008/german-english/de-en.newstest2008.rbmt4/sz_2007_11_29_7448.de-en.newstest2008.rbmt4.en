In the empire of Angela Wolke
The unrealistic appearance of the chancellor documents that the coalition is as regards content at the end - and that from herself nothing more is to be expected.
In which land does this Federal Chancellor live, actually?
After her hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag which wurschtig and was poor in contents one must say: not here - not in the land which would have to be governed by her, finally.
Angela Merkel with a badly haughty sentence has rejected the reproach that it concentrates too much upon the foreign affairs.
This is provincial, she said and showed with it only that she does not want to understand what it is for the critics about.
In the Bundestag she has documented for everything recognizably, how much their reproach applies.
There neither concrete interest nor even a feeling was to be felt for the problems in the land.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a removed politician who flees in the foreign affairs and remains even there in the approximate.
Example climate protection: There she praises herself without braking for the decisions of saint's dam, however, does not say how in this country the climate purposes should be reached.
Generally, the selfpraise - so much presumptuousness would have denied itself the CDP boss still two years ago.
Now she clings to the empty phrase that the impetus comes with the people.
With it she damages her image as the pragmatist who solves problems instead of the world sch√∂nzureden.
But in the empire of Angela Wolke domestic problems are a secondary phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of the low breadwinners?
She has a few subordinate clauses for it, for the rest.
Besides, it is typical, how often she makes a slip when it is about the children's allowance.
Merkel needs three approaches there to bring out a more or less straight sentence.
She trips like on foreign terrain if it becomes concrete.
