Bush draws an arrangement between Israelis and Palestinians
By the opening of the international peace conference which had assembled on Tuesday under his management in Annapolis, Maryland, president Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had agreed, finally, on a common explanation.
He further explained that Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin immediately with negotiations to find a final regulation of the 60 year-old disputes between her both people.
In the presence of both men Bush promised that he will do everything to help them, to close before the end of 2008 Friedensvertrag .
In the interim the Palestinians must destroy die terrorist infrastructures  and Israel must put his Kolonisierungsarbeiten, explained Bush and he reminded both parties of her obligations in view of Fahrplan  for the peace to which these had agreed in 2003.
The boss of the White House stressed that the negotiations aim at a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinian authority under Abbas, after all, which should clear all open questions without exception, and including the central questions .
This name encloses three serious problems on which the disputes primarily turn between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the destiny of the Arabian refugees who were expelled in the course of the conflict of 1948 from her native country which lies in the today's state Israel.
According to the American president Abbas seized the word and insisted on the fact that the coming negotiations umfassend and thoroughly  are led and deliver for all points a regulation, and he unter other Jerusalem, the refugees which enumerated borders, the colonies, waters and security.
When Olmert seized on his part the word, he committed himself to the fact that the coming armistice negotiations direkt and without interruption  are led and to the fact that he will take care that these can be still finished before the end of 2008.
Bush has fixed the term to the conversion of his Vision two states , Palestinian one and Israeli one which exist side by side for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it has received an assurance in this sense of Bush from Bush, before it resolved to take part in the conference.
Arabia whose participation shows a big success for Washington in Annapolis has escorted a plan assumed by all Arabian lands in the ways which offers the peace to Israel, in the exchange with his retreat from all Arabian areas which had been taken during the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis shows a scabbard way in the history of middle East, particularly because it in the roots of the conflict and in his central points of view attacks , thinks the Saudi-Arabian prince in his interview with the Arabian-speaking newspaper financed by Saudi money.
