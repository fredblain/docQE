Approach final year-Rally aheadies to the stock exchange? Disagreement with the experts on account of the US-mortgage crisis
With just five weeks up to the annual accounts on the stock exchange the investors already rub themselves the hands in view of the next final year-Rally.
The experts can still provide with respect to that no sure predictions.
Banif believes that rein looks statistically which walks along December on the stock exchange ordinarily with a positive market development
It is nevertheless advisable not to provide predictions at short notice and only on the basis of statistics. Above all not when tensions to be taken seriously determine the topical market events
Although other experts do not favor such a strong course increase during the last weeks of the year, these still mark that der stock market course from given liquidity of the market and the market participants is determined. These invest on account of the lack of sure stock funds primarily in pension fund which is strongly concerned by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend to to assets rich in yield.
Therefore the stock exchange will show a rather lateral course trend influenced by market fluctuations according to opinion of these experts rather, vor to all because we cannot estimate yet the magnitudes of the possible decline of the interest rate of the US issuing bank, an insecurity above all on the risen crude oil price and the danger of the increase of the inflation rate is to be led back. 
Javier Barrio, chairperson of the sales department with BPI in Spain, agrees with the fact that it is a risqué time to announce a forthcoming Markt-Rally.
Die chances do not stand very well , assures the expert.
The Spanish share index Ibex has already lost since his Höchstmarke on the 8th November from 15,945.7 points a value of 4%.
But not all experts divide the same negative opinion.
In view of Juan Solana, analyst with Intermoney, could conclude the Ibex 35 as a result of the restructuring of the investment fund and the traditional, every year in this time carried out Bezuschussung of the pension fund, the year successfully with nearly 16,000 points.
The expert still emphasizes that this year the things could develop a little bit differently; above all on account of already in the second December week, and, therefore, directly after the bridge day by the day of the constitution, taking place final year-Rally.
In the opinion of the analyst the price fluctuations would not influence the market trends.
According to appraisal of Federico Olucha, analyst at bank Inversis, the present judgements are to the market position at a nearly technical level what could lead to it, dass itself soon a divergence from the index values could draw, magnitudes depended on the results of the US-mortgages market crisis.
The analyst trusts in the fact that these are positive.
With the choice of the values which should speed up the Ibex to new maxima the analysts agree.
Solana von Intermoney protests that dieses year the big values are in the row. 
The expert would count two major banks and some real estate companies to the worth winners, da the stream sector at the given time will be too expensive. 
Meanwhile Federico Olucha of bank Inversis assures that the increases walk along in connection with the bank sector and industrial sector.
If the Rally really occurs, the real estate companies will profit from her.
Die Automobile Club of Switzerland was during the last months on Aufholkurs and we hope that other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC smash the same way,  thus the expert.
Concerning the raised consumer behaviour during the Christmas Day the periodical consumption will determine in the last half of the year the market events.
On the other hand, the expert believes that also the technologies achieve positive sales results, even if they are represented at the Spanish market only in low number.
Five times in seven years
During the last seven years December showed sinking course courses only in two cases.
When end of 2003 the technology bubble burst, this led the stock exchange from her crisis and initiated at the same time the real final year rally last up to now.
This year in which the Ibex 35 caught up about 28.17 percent points December a course increase of 6.68% showed.
Whether in 2008 the fifth gainful year as a result of becomes (the Ibex rises since January by 8.36%) and also an Endjahresrally can show, will appear.
