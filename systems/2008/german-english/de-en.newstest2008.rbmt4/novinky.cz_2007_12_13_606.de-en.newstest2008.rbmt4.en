Integration of Slovak pupils at britschen schools does not succeed
At British schools the number of children from lands of East Europe increases what causes in the local fears around the other development of the local school system.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans bumps up to now into a row of obstacles.
British schools find out even cases where disputes increase between the immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants in act of violence.
The case of North Kent illustrates the problem with the integration of children from East Europe at britschen schools appropriately where the discussions increase between the local and Slovak immigrants bit by bit.
Set-tos, chicaneries and fights among pupils have spread to the relations between the parents.
The situation has developed already so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who had hit a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The culprit defended herself with the fact that the boy has offended them with racist terms of abuse.
The police also had to intervene after an attack of two girls under age on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had done towards the man supposedly racist remarks and had pelted him with stones.
" When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus small house and spitted on us.
When I said to him, he should stop, he pelted us with apples and pears and then bared his bottom, " a mother of Slovak pupils of the newspaper The Times described an other disagreeable incident.
Discomfort comes from both sides.
One of the locals called the quarrel with the immigrants from East Europe even survival fight.
The cited cases testify that the mood becomes more and more tense between local and immigrants at British schools.
In Great Britain 70000 Slovaks who came here on working search are announced.
Therefore, about 30000 Slovak pupils visit British schools.
