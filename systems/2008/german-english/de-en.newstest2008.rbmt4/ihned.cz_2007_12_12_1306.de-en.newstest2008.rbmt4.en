Czechia has the chance to come to 365 billions
Yesterday Czech ministers and representatives of the European committee signed a total of nine developing programs by which Czech Republic can come during the next years to 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns).
It is here about about half of the sum which can receive Czechia from the year 2007 to 2013 generally from Brussels.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programs.
Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns from the program " enterprise and innovation " assigned.
Mostly money, about 150 billions, will flow into the traffic removal.
The traffic program is the biggest developing program and encloses up to 22 percent of the means which Czechia from the fund can receive.
This money raises accordingly the household of the state transport infrastructure fund which will dispose the next year of 90.8 billions.
The program " enterprise and innovation " should serve enterprisers and companies to win finances to innovative enterprises.
The companies should thereby win finances for the introduction of new technologies, for operations research, but also for the introduction of more actual organization methods.
With the present Geld-Aquisition from EU fund Czechia belongs under the new entry lands to up to now in the least successful one.
