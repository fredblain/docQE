The mediators of the Troika which unites the European Union, the USA and Russia in itself will meet on Monday the last time in Serbia and in Kosovo.
The future to 90% of in Albanian speaking inhabited province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit her report to the UN Security Council up to the 10th December.
The conversations of Baden, close to Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiations meeting since the Troika the last August of UN the order to a new mediation had received.

After Kosovo has stood during eight years under management of UN, the western lands hold the independence under supervision by the EU for the only solution with future.

They must end in such a way as they have begun: in the security council. 
