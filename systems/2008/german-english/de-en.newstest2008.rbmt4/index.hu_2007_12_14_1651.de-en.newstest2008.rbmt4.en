In many places it is saved in disinfectants
This year more than thousand infections were registered in the hospitals which were to be led back on an improper contact with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the Überbelegung of the beds, the overloading of the staff - all factors which are not quite good for damming the infections, according to the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center.
In many places it is also saved with the disinfectants.
In the Traumatologie department of the János of hospital a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was delivered after a heavy accident to the hospital.
The patient was isolated.
Here at the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection.
The injured person of a heavy car accident was dismissed from the hospital, however, after a little while the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation could not since then because of the bacterium which is still in the body of the patient yet.
Until of this year 10th December 1094 infections released by multiresistant causes were announced from hospitals to the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system, according to the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many, by multiresistant causes released infections were registered in the hospitals with certainty, however, the dark figure might be high.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) became from the MRSA, the Staphylococcus resistant to Methicillin-Oxacillin aureus released.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SATURDAY) bacterium carries possibly one third of the people in her nose, without it would cause an illness.
SA conditioned infections (as for example pharyngitis, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) react mostly well to antibiotics, they are well remediable.
If the means are measured, however, too high or are applied improperly, the resistant to antibiotics who spread out under suitable conditions in the hospitals fast originate from the well respondierenden bacteria.
In particular with patients with weak, or permanently badly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight these bacteria can cause heavy infections, as for example sore infection or blood poisoning, thus sepsis.
To the medical leader of the János of hospital according to the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the ill house everyday life.
One may mistake the infection not for the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there is not where it is not searched.
Resistant against antibiotics
" Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff carries elastic gloves and masks on the care, and we dispose of the antibiotics necessary for the treatment " - thus Tibor Nyulasi.
Indeed, with her admission in the hospital the patients are examined for MRSA, an infection can be still not always avoided.
Test withdrawals too seldom
The majority of the infections released by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, indeed, the conditions ruling nowadays and circumstances are unfavorably for the containment of the origin or the propagation of the multiresistant cause, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection seems mainly in hospitals and old people's homes, the hospitals should examine the delivered patients and isolate immediately MRSA infected.
Nevertheless, in the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological test withdrawal is not carried out so often.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation vonseiten of the state health insurance scheme.
Hence, most cases would come only in the daylight when the patient already has a sensible MRSA infection, according to the medical leader of the epidemiology center.
There is Vonseiten of the European Union strict recommendations to the suitable application of antibiotics in the human medicine, however, there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures.
Antibiotic therapies should be purposeful, that is microbiological investigations are necessary, so that no resistance to the means can form, indeed, this directive is also not always kept by hospitals.
Under the ambulant, or itself in the basic care located patients microbiological test withdrawals are even even rarer, according to Karolina Böröcz.
It is saved with the disinfectants
Scientific proofs prove that MRSA of a patient on other will transfer most often from the nursing staff.
Just, therefore, comes to the hand washing, or carrying of gloves and masks a big meaning to, indeed, there are also in this area considerable defects in the hospitals.
MRSA will transfer by droplet infection or contact, however, in the home hospitals not always exists the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds briefly are lined up, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from epidemiological view.
As Karolina Böröcz further marks, unfortunately, it even happens in the financially less well put hospitals that is saved with disinfectants, there are few orderlies, many patients - all factors which almost favor the origin of infections.
Such infections are far less frequent there as can be proved, or the other spreading of the cause can be detained where these preventive measures are kept, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
To gain control of MRSA infections causes to the health insurances huge costs, everywhere, hence, they are fought.
In England the prevention of MRSA, or her containment in the government program became, for example, held on.
After the first signs the program is successful - as published data cover, the trend of the MRSA infections is falling in England.
The European center for illness prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the origin of multiresistant causes (under it also MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of his priorities explained.
