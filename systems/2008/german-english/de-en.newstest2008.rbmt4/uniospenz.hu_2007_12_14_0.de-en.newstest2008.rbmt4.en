Fodor and six Hungarian percent
As minister of the environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert's meetings come to an end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 is continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 lands consult on the timetable of Bali in which the issue-reducing measures are fixed for the time after 2012, thus at the end of the Kyoto protocol.
Nowadays a violent debate is between industrial lands and developing countries going.
The USA have already signaled that they do not want to negotiate about concrete figures, indeed, they be would ready to reduce the greenhouse gas issues in comparison to 1990 about 25-40 percent till 2020.
The other big question of the conference is whether the industrial states are ready to support the developing countries financially, as well as beside the reduction of the issues technological.
An agreement about the support was also achieved by developing countries.
The adaptation fund subordinated to the Kyoto protocol should be administered by a 16-headed council, probably with the global Umweltfazilität (GEF) of UN, how in the " Piac és profit " is to be read up.
Six percent of Hungary
Minister of the environment Gábor Fodor supports in the name of Hungary the attempt of the EU to maintain her forerunner role with global climate protection measures, and to achieve a new international agreement till 2009.
The minister explained, the EU will reduce the greenhouse gas issues about 20% till 2020 (measured in the values of 1990), no matter whether the " agreement is achieved after 2012 " successfully, or not. The union be would even ready to exert itself for a 30-percent reduction, soferne other big industrial states of the world, or developing countries are likewise ready to follow to her obligations after forces and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states which had joined in 1997 to the Kyoto protocol was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, while the EU with her 15 member states at that time had already committed itself to a deficit of 8%.
The default for Hungary is reduction of the greenhouse gas issues about 6% in comparison to 1985-87 - a default which will fulfil the land absolutely as in the press release of the ministry of the environment is to be read up.
The application is high on Bali - at least, the long-term international climate-political agreement must be ready within two years, otherwise it would come into force with certainty only after 2012. In this case no renewed, international issue reduction system would follow the reduction plans agreed in the Kyoto protocol whose meaning has also emphasized the IPCC, the international scientific climate change-committee excellent with the peace Nobel prize of UN in his latest report.
The issue reduction would be thereby delayed, and the rise of the average temperature of the earth around more than 2°C would be inevitable what would entail extremely serious and irreparable consequences according to scientists.
