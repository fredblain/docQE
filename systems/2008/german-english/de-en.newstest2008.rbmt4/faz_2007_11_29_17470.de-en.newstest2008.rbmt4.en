These are not Warhol's boxes
Who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or, nevertheless?
Nowadays produced wooden boxes throw in Sweden dark shades on Warhol's work list.
A large part 94 Brillo boxing listed there of the " type Stockholm " are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" has poked doubt about the genuineness of Andy's Warhol Brillo boxing of 1968 some months ago, internal investigations come in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now to a sobering result: Six "Brillo boxes" which former museum manager Pontus Hultén has left the Moderna Museet in 1995 as a donation are copies - and probably also the large part about hundred other Brillo boxing of the " type Stockholm " which are at the international art market in circulation.
The prehistory is interlaced, a bewildering concatenation of artistic and kuratorischer productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes", painted wooden boxes which are based on the red blue-white design of the cartons of the soap powder "Brillo" in New York.
An exhibit of his works in the Moderna Museet in 1968 issued - by Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard: These came (for cost reasons) not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo board mill.
It concerned not pieces of art, but their models, around bare exhibit pieces.
At the same time Warhol has given in 1968 probably the permission to let produce some Brillo-wooden boxes in Sweden which were not issued, however, in the Moderna Museet.
Now contemporary witnesses speak of about fifteen boxes which have come " type Stockholm " rightly into the art and auction history at that time as an authorized Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name.
Some of them have achieved on auctions more than 100,000 dollars.
Now the problem is that legendary museum manager Pontus Hultén has stated later falsely, about hundred wooden boxes have been produced in 1968 in Sweden and have been issued which leave Warhol to him then has.
Really Hulténs 105 boxes were produced only in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibit in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol was already dead three years.
Lars Byström, Chefkonservator in the Moderna Museet, has examined beside six Brillo boxes belonging to museum also three from Swedish private property by which two were made in 1968 in Stockholm: Their pressboard records were only undercoated and sanded down, then white oil paint with a paintbrush was applied.
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 against the fact betrays that the color with a painter's role was applied without priming directly on the pressboard record - in addition, it concerns not oil paint, but acrylic color.
" These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy's Warhol Brillo boxes ", the manager of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve lets announce: " If 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' does not come in New York to another end, the Moderna Museet will class six boxes in his collection as copies / exhibit material. "
Already in July, admittedly, the Authentication Board has announced to follow the " heavy accusations " which are raised in the matter of the soap powder boxes.
However, since that time one wraps himself there in relentless silence.
