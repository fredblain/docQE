In the Budaörser commercial triangle the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased of this year about 16 percent, indeed, price increases were registered in all hypermarkets by more than 1,000 HOOFS.
After the prices are in the food markets in the last December "davongaloppiert", the price increase prozentuell has been not drastic, compared to the anyway high, earlier source level.
Indeed, it looks deterrent on the consumers certainly that that for what they had paid last year still far less than 9,000 HOOFS this year is not even available for 10,000 HOOFS.
The price of the "Napi" of goods basket crossed the magic 10,000-hoof border about at least 91 HOOFS in the examined markets.
The highest price amounted to 10.573 HOOFS.
(In 6800 the price lay with 6,800 HOOFS.)
The prices of Unicum and living fish remained nearly at year before level, have strongly risen, however, the prices of turkeys breast fillets, nut and poppy.
Prices of flour and bread corresponded to the data of the central statistical office of Hungary, nevertheless, with Auchan there was 1 kg of bread reveille for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive-conditioned steep fall in prices on less than 200 Forint with the product.
The price of two liters of Coca Cola security bottle of less than 200 Forint was likewise astonishing here, therefore the drink cost including security only 257 HOOFS.
Still cut of this year in the "Napi" goods basket-comparison Auchan most expensive, and Cora most for a good price from.
Our calculations have proved, that Cora the prices in the "Napi" goods basket compared with the Christmas prices last year around 15, while Tesco and Auchan have raised in each case by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest goods basket of the year before and the most expensive one of the wine bar year amounted to 12%, while the rise put out 21% between the cheapest goods basket of the last year and most expensive of the current year.
The average rise in prices amounted to 1,480.00 HOOF.
The average price increase lay in the year before still with 1,206.00 Forint, indeed, the value added tax rise became apparent with the prices to the last Christmas.
Exactly this process has dripped trade badly: Apparently the department stores could not decide so surely which prize span they should apply with the single articles, because the consequences of the price increase on the consumer behaviour were unpredictable.
(If the trader plans the orbiting speed of a product badly, he can fall around essential profits in the prize span which is directed after the traffic intensity.)
Mehwertsteuer-bedingt the price increase of the "Napi" of goods basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket crossed the value of 2006 about 1720 Forint, while the difference between prices amounted only to 844 Forint with the cheapest basket.
Of this year such extremes were not observed, because the most expensive basket cost about 1,630.00 Forint more than in the year before, and even with the cheapest one there was a rise in prices of 1,284.00 Forint.
In the comparison of both last Christmas seasons a catastrophic price increase appeared, the price of the everyday consumption articles in the hypermarkets has risen in less than 20 months by more than 30 percent.
(This confirms not necessarily the data of the central statistical office of Hungary again: With some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months ascertained a more than 30-percent price increase.
So in possibly beside flour also with eggs.)
If one throws, nevertheless, a look in the "Napi" to goods basket, this seems impossible with latter nearly, because the prize level of the product already expensive in the year before has risen even in the worst case about barely more than 10 percent.
Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten - at least, could shift them the drastic price increase on the multinationals.
In the golden commercial triangle the hypermarkets do not complain; It is reported constantly from good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers does not look in three department stores at all at the prices.
It are bought from all large amount, long-lasting food goes to palettes above the counters.
There was Wednesday vormittag in all three department stores endless queues with the Kassa when suddenly the number of the customers exploded.
Indeed, a lower customer frequency is reported about the land, so that many multinationals complain with the pollsters, they could not even reach the planned turnover, namely not only with food, but also with lasting consumer goods.
