A colleague informs about the admission of unlawful Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:

B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1,000 euros, indeed, the theft becomes as a criminal offense-classified, the punishment still falls more slightly from than with a download (article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you pinch a car and return it forty hours later again, the punishment is still lower than with a download (article 244.1).
D. It is to be taken part less seriously in a fight than in a music data-exchange.

(Article 270 Criminal Code).
E. According to the article 184.2 of the Criminal Code sexual harassment in the workplace is looked as less bad than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.

Thus the feelings originating from the monthly salary payment are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was provided help of a tomographisch magnetic authoritative analysis at the university of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the science-magazine Science.
After statement of Bernd Webers, author of the study and manager of the Bonn brain research center Life*Brain, war the activation strongest when the participant gave right answers and his player failed, however. 
The researchers could recognize that the cerebral activities were always very moderate when both participants with her answer lay properly and got, therefore, also the same salary; but if one of them received the double one, it also came to a stronger cerebral activity. 
I am not quite sure to me whether it really requires so much scientific expenditure to reach to such a result.
