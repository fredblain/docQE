Deceitful broker risked billions because of feeling of inferiority
Bottomless swindler
Thus French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
She came since because of him about nearly five billion euros.
However, it seems rather in such a way that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to touch it his colleagues, in addition, certainly was not incapable.
To the difference to all big bank houses he recognized on time the crisis by the amerikanischenn mortgage market.
" He is psychically rather weak, " was to be heard from the mouth of his superiors who indicated him at the police.
How, however, it arises from the statements Kerviels which published the French media, for example, the newspaper Le moons, he was a person, the end of the last year with his shops profits at the rate of 1.6 billion euros had achieved.
Crisis not only in America
" Everything what I wanted was to be earned for my bank money, " he states in his statement.
In summer he had succeeded in earning half a billion euros just on the American crisis.
In addition he had spotted of the opportunity since already in the beginning of the year.
In February there was the quite first news about the fact that so-called Sub Prime mortgages, like they had income-weak customer or such, the before redemption problems, would be given, get in difficulties.
However, influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis.
Kerviel did not believe this and kept right.
In the end of the year he had raised his profit up to 1.6 billion euros.
" Already as me the first half a billion had earned, I did not know how I should explain this, " admits Kerviel and repeats that he has kept definitively nothing for himself.
During the whole questioning he admits that he has faked documents, so that one would not come to him on the tricks.
He succeeded even in leading his bosses behind the light, even if bit by bit the Eurex stock exchange been interested in his shops.
Risk profit
Did he fear to fly up?
Probably barely.
" I thought that she satisfies the simple fact that I have earned 1.6 billions for the bank. "
Where from he took the courage to risk so much?
He had to work his position gradually.
He entered into the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after he had finished his study at the university of Lyons.
His annual salary amounted to about 51,000 dollars.
After two years he was already an assistant of a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Still he knew that he will never earn so much like others.
" Already in my first conversation in 2005 I knew that one observed me.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development, " explained Kerviel the inquisitor.
But soon after his entry there came the first big success.
With the stocks of the alliance he earned a lot, while he put half a billion euros on course losses of this title in the London bomb attacks.
And this was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you do profit, we leave you
" This is like a snowball, " he said the policeman.
But the bosses knew supposedly about all, or anticipated it.
" As long as I earned money, one closed the eyes. "
However, then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
During one single day he lost a billion euros.
On a week-end at the middle of January he wanted to compensate this.
When he came on Monday to the work, he was already no more an employee of the bank.
And a few days later the bank announced that it has lost because of him five billion euros.
And how did they come to him on the tricks?
Suspicious he came along by a vacation.
" I have taken only four days of the year before.
A broker who takes no vacation is one which does not want that one looks to him in the maps, " said Kerviel finally.
