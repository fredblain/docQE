Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Voruteile dwindle
To say the truth, I never was a special fan of Peugeot 206.
His handling characteristics were not a lot worth, one could call the quality of the way circuit, the steering system and also the processing rather subnormal.
However, now is his successor, Peugeot 207, at the market, and he is better around a lot.
The station-wagon with the name SW is other one more piece, and to me remains only to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classical Hatchback of 207, I had to complain, for example, of the too low head room on the Hintersitzen.
There is this discomfort now no more, because the bodywork of the station-wagon is so formed that Zweimetermänner will not even suffer.
Quick further
I go through the interior equipment only briefly not to recur too much.
It concerns a rather successful design where I have objections only because of the miserable middle tunnel.
There I would greet a little bit more designerische creation where the car does, otherwise, such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times where we complained, perhaps, to too short seats or headrests.
Also the side hold has substantially improved compared with 206.
What concerns the space offer, one can also feel here the enlarged dimensions of the bodywork.
In the station-wagon the already mentioned lack of head room is also removed.
Suitcase in the boot
However, the central issue in this car is the loading bay.
I must call him (also because of the openable back window) very well loadable and space-saving.
The hollow cavities are equipped with hold belts which show an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and also hold on heavier objects.
However, we talk about the loading volume.
It amounts according to table in the basic equipment to 428 liters what is a rather average value in comparison to competition.
Indeed, not in comparison to vehicle bestselling in Czechia of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find out that Peugeot stays behind about clearly perceptible 52 liters.
For a foreign vacation or with the invitation of a baby carriage this value is already critical.
But to emphasize around the Positiva, I must still mention on folding down the back seats quite level loading bay or also the very low loading edge.
120 HP in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four coil petrol engine with cubic capacity 1.6 liters and an achievement of 88 kW.
And honestly said, so a 1600Kubik engine should look which drives a Familien-Hatchback.
He is quiet, has a low consumption and moves well.
If I compare him to his counterpart in Škoda which sometimes works as if his exhaust with a cloth was blocked, then I can be only inspired by him.
The price-list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not quite popular.
However, we must remember that we have tested a well equipped car with a spacious Innneren and a very good engine.
The base price of the car with the 1400th petrol engine at the rate of 329,900 crowns still begins.
With our engine it costs from 410,900 crowns what is already quite a lot.
The equipment premium of the test car hits once again with 80,000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head air bags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic windshield wiper release, electric window lifters behind and and...
Thus the car costs all together settles 531,900 crowns.
This is an amount, but you add up once the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will come with a quite similar sum.
Thus only the decision remains which brand one wants to choose.
