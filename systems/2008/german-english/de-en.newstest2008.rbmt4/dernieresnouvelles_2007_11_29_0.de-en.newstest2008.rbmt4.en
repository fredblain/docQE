The choice of the status quo
On Sunday it will not become exciting with the counting up of the urns: The mass of the Russians will decide on president's Putin party, combined Russia.
After a very bolted election campaign she confirms her striving for stability, even to Autoritarismus.
Three days before the parliamentary elections Russian president Vladimir Putin directs news emitted on the public transmitters to the voters which was already taped, indeed whose contents are kept secret, nevertheless.
He does this in his quality as a top candidate of combined Russia, the pro-Kremlin party for which an overpowering victory announces itself.
Yesterday the president let nothing look though when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was content to deliver a new attack point against the west powers which are accused of the interference favorite subject during the election campaign.
Wir know the price of a truthful democracy and expect to us honest choices, extremely transparently and openly, choices without fraudulences , he added.
From view of the opposition they have made a mistake there.
They prangert an election campaign stained by suppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says, there would have been niemals such dirty choices, not even in the time of Eltsin .
After the suppression of the demonstrations on the last week-end, counts to ex-chess world champion Garry Kasparovder for unauthorised demonstrating by five days of custody visit ban had been condemned, according to his lawyer furthermore.
Die Russians have retained integrity the mentality of the homo Sovieticus 
After these parliamentary elections without tension two much continuing questions set themselves up:
 Who will start Putin succession as a president?
Yesterday the office newspaper has announced the date of the first ballot of the presidency choices, 2nd March, 2008; the candidates have to time 23rd December to announce themselves.
Because he was chosen in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot line up for the third mandate as a result of.
And now no successor is found.
Which role will Putin play after March?
Prime minister?
Chairperson of the majority in parliament and the omnipotent party combined Russia which will select government and president?
Whatever it will be, by the parliament choices or by the presidency choices, the present power will triumph.
This is a tradition.
Die Russians have retained integrity the mentality of the homo Sovieticus, they are not man of her destiny , thinks sociologist Lev Goudkov, manager of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the state university of Saint Petersburg goes back even even further: The middle-class society has only very slowly developed in this land which became five centuries after Europe christianisiert; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s Putin has gone back to the model of a paternalistischen state again what was completely accepted by the population, the more, because no terror followed this new Paternalismus, but a certain economic prosperity, means Maria Lipman of the Carnegie endowment.
Today verzichten  the Russians aus to free pieces on the personal responsibility  which they have displayed after the decay of the USSR for a short time.
Wozu still consider long? 
This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the business world.
And the administrative élite knows how to hold the status Quo: 65 governors (from 85 Russian region chairpersons) state the local electoral lists of combined Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the west are often synonymous with chaos, how in the 90s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense the Russians will also not be right for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Wozu still consider long?
Those which are in power are not so bad, why they remove? 
