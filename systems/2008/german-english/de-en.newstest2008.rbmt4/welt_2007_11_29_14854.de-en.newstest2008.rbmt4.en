Richard Gere is not simply cynical enough
Two films with the Balkan war deal with " The Hunting of party " and " of murderous peace " again.
However, both are not convincing.
Either the drafts place too much on action and Geballer or, however, them are too soppy.
There Richard Gere can also not help in " The Hunting of party ".
The good news first: Indeed, the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but just there, now in the sombre hinterland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere has been found again.
We had lost the nicest man of the eighties years last out of sight because much too many nice-insignificant roles drove out the desire for glance in films for good sensations for women and much too many press conferences on the subject Buddhism to one.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, himself " The Hunting party - If the hunter becomes the hunted " (Why must film titles be so long today, actually, always and be weird like train driver's wage agreements?) to consider maybe, nevertheless.
He delivers a wonderfully winking representation: Basically his war reporter Simon Hunt is that what could have become from Gere if the destiny and the film branch were not so merciful: A man who has his very best times long behind himself which has still preserved substantial rests of the former charm, however, itself as the monument same to ruins of his decline.
But in spite of this trump " The Hunting of party " continues only the endless row of failed Balkan war-films together with the German production " of murderous peace " which likewise starts this week.
With " murderous peace " one can do short process: The film acts from two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian before kosovarischen sniper on which to itself one falls in love promptly still in them.
Although it is welcome that here once the Serbians are not shown as a sole root all evil, the television-level film loses itself much too fast in Geballer and action.
There remains a kind " alarm for Cobra 11 " without highway, however, for it with war.
Against it can be investigated in " The Hunting of party " virtually exemplarily, why there has never been, actually, a really good Balkans-war film.
The history of three US-war reporters who start to track down the Serbian upper war criminal " the fox " could have become with another director and another scriptwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard) another time maybe new "Apocalypse Now".
Since the stories are similar remarkably: Both times go small teams to the wood to accomplish something what the military cannot do and both times it becomes a trip in the insanity.
One of the reasons for the failure of " The Hunting of party " is that one does not allow to be Simon Hunt simply the dilapidated cynic with heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the Script must still impute a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin to him in addition.
Finally " The Hunting of party " goes brook under it when the reporters within the last five minutes in the time-lapse photography procedure manage this what Nato, CIA and all reward hunters of the world have not created in five years: The war criminal catch and leave to the Muslim Bosnians to the fair revenge.
This is so bad that one would like to call the international court of law in Hague because of crimes against the film logic.
Besides, the film has a profoundly human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic walk around still freely, and he suspects the Americans and here the French (should agree they exceptionally sometimes) to pursue the pursuit on account of confidential political arrangements not too intensely.
But the well meant and this Nastily are sometimes so similar to themselves that to one a famous Brecht's poem comes to the sense.
In it one says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the working table of the poet: " Compassionately I see the swollen forehead veins, suggestive: how exerting it is to be angry ".
Films like " The Hunting of party " have exactly such Schwellköpfe which indicate, however, how exerting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently is in this newspaper reports become that all Iraq films of Hollywood were big flops.
One can add: There has never still been a good South Africa film.
Almost always counts: If a star on the crisis stoves or mine fields of the world hangs around, besides, such a thing comes out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, " beyond all borders " with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All conflicts are chronologically simply possibly still too close.
Decades had to pass, at least, before Hollywood with " roofer's list " could turn a good film about the Holocaust.
Some film will probably still mature - the Vietnam works counting now as a classic " The Deer of Hunter ", "Apocalypse Now" or " Full Metal of jacket " have been celebrated at that time by no means unanimously as masterpieces.
But today maybe we know where every mass murder comes on a real-time basis on immediately two screens at home, also simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And this robs the screenplay writers of the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs it to tell good stories.
" His or non-existence "or" the big dictator " have become so good, in the end, also because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet how badly the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe one may not want to be good if one wants to do good films.
Maybe one must have the sarcastically reserved artist's look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When was questioned about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Wörterbuch" and the Balkan war, he answered: " This is only due to the fact that some things never change.
Cities will be dangerous always terribly, people will be murdered always in horrific way and always war will rule in Yugoslavia. "
