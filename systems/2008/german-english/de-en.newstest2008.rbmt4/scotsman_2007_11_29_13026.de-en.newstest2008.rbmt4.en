The climate on the Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus was maybe once a pleasant place to the life, said scientists yesterday.
Data of a European spaceship located on an orbit show that the planet resembles a turned away twin of the earth even more than up to now was aware.
The Venus is the n√§heste planet-aryan neighbor of the earth.
Both worlds own about the same size and have similar planet roads, indeed, the Venus of the sun is a little closer.
Before billions from years would have ruled on the Venus conditions which would have been very similarly to those on the earth and could have been even inhabitable, believe scientists today.
But because of the carbon dioxide greenhouse effect without brakes, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar irradiation and a slower rotation tempo the Venus smashed another developing course.
Today the planet is robbed by water and has a surface temperature which is hot enough to melt lead and is laid waste by hurricane-strong hoists and flash storms.
The knowledge of the space probe Venus express train of the European space agency which has examined the planning for a year offers a sobering look at how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic changes in climate.
Professor Fred Taylor of the department of physics at the university of Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus express train mission, said: " It becomes clear, why the climate on the Venus so passed away to that of the earth is, while the planets are quite similar to themselves otherwise. "
" Our new data enable to construct a scenario in which the Venus has begun before billions from years like the earth, possibly with an inhabitable environment. "
