Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are exactly regulated legally, so that the practise of the Umdisponierens of the working days has set up all around the holidays meanwhile, indeed, the next year gives to us less such days.
Also in the EU and in America one understands something else by "holiday".
The Hungarian judicial system makes a distinction between national holidays and work-free days.
Work-free days are mostly ecclesiastical holidays, or stand with significant historical events in connection.
We celebrate, for example, also New Year: The last day of the old, as well as the first day of the new year are work-free days - latter only already with it itself the New Year's Eve-celebrating can rest.
In the whole year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The national holidays are a 15th March which reminds of the revolution of 1848, and 23rd October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.
20th August the state foundation, on the 1st May the work famedly, will think on the 1st and 2nd November we of our dead people.
In addition, there is two holidays to Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Because our state, national days or religious holidays seldom fall on a week-end, the practise of the "working day-movement" plans itself in the cases proves itself in which we would work or after the holiday only one day.
However, the price of the extended week-ends is that we work on Saturdays before it very well, or must go to the school.
When this day which falls before or after the holiday at last should be processed, for long it is fixed by the employment minister in own order.
The statutory regulation counts to all employers and employees, for public employees and official of the civil service equally.
Only companies and equipment in which the company is continued without interruption, thus also in the holidays are excluded.
This year the working rules are mixed up only by the holidays in the end of the year a little bit: In this country from the 24th December the life stops formally, because most for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve time balance, or the vacation specially lifted for it take.
Next year more holidays fall in the weekly middle, or on the end of the week, so that there will be less Umdisponierungen, than this year during the working days.
The calendar is put first all around the day of the work " on the head ", so that the people immediately four days in the piece can stay at home.
Saturday, 26th April becomes a working day, so that Friday, 2nd May a rest day can be.
The second Umdisponierung hangs together with the holiday on the 23rd October: On Saturday, 18th October one will have to process him Friday, 24th October to begin with.
However, at the end of the year will stand completely in the sign of the holidays, after from the 24th December everything lie and stops, even if New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
