Political Capital: Hungarian guard raises state risk
In the opinion of the department for risk analysis (Risk Analysing division) from Political Capital the activities in this August with support of the " movement for better Hungary have raised " founded Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and the region in several regard.
Among the rest, in the "risk warning-report" of the institute one says: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk shows the " increase of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gipsy and not-Gipsy's population in Hungary which could lead even at short notice to violent ethnic discussions ".
Principal reason for it is the strategy of the Hungarian guard which is presumably aimed at the provocation of such a discussion, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is looked as an omission by sides of the politically persons responsible: " Persons of the public life have the discussion Roma-Frage Vertretern more radically of political groupings leave which have built up now her political strategy on the Roma Hungary contrast ".
One supposes that aggravate this the problem, the reasonable dialog make impossible, extremities favor above others, as well as would raise the likelyhood of violent discussions.
In addition, the Forschungsinsitut means which would have activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the huge attention of sides of the home and foreign media, " the picture of Hungary abroad considerably injured, in particular what the trust concerns in the stability and democratic maturity ".
We remember: Since autumn, 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups is in Hungary continuously in the impetus, so that since summer, 2007 several, " national self-defense association " calling organizations were founded themselves.
" To these groupings is common that they define themselves in each case as a civil organization, while they boast openly of it, her members on - every now and then armed - to prepare defensive tasks (emergency services, national defense, Ordnungshütung), with reference to the unsuitability of the police, the army, or the state even ", called it.
And further: All that happens according to that method which tries to camouflage different, on the policy and party sullenness of the population based, political attempts as a middle-class initiative.
The stress of the civil character and the association form do not serve only the avoidance of juridical hurdles which could appear in the course of the registration at court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
How of the analysis is to be taken, the activities of the Hungarian guard show a risikoerhöhenden factor also for the relations with the neighbouring states.
" During the last months the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighbouring states as a potential danger spring, quite a lot of of the ultranationalistic politicians of certain neighboring countries sees in the origin of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own Anti Hungary policy.
All that has consequences on the political stability of the region " - one said.
From the point of the research institute the foundation of the Hungarian guard is no single phenomenon in central east Europe, therefore the political risk has grown for the whole region.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian guard are comparable with those of the Bulgarian national guard whose foundation was announced in August, 2007 by the radically right-wing Bulgarian national union (BNU).
In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian guard there stood the Roma-mass excesses which have taken place in a town quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents immediately to the occasion for the foundation of the national guard, with the argument that the purpose of the organization is the " national protection ".
In her opinion a regular "Gipsy's terror" was perceptible since during the past 17 years in Bulgaria, nevertheless, the state remained idle and indifferent - thus Political Capital.
And further: The initiative would have kicked off a violent debate in the Bulgarian general public.
As said, the raised risk for ethnic discussions is also proved by the fact that have announced some Bulgarian Roma-Organisationen to found her own guard for opposition purposes.
Because the activities of the Hungarian guard up to now many resemblances to those point to the Bulgarian national guard, it is not to be excluded that Hungarian Roma likewise, with organizing her own protection react to the menaces, one says in the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research manager with Political Capital said on inquiry of the press agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Yearly risk analysis reports would be published, and should be recognizable to risk-changing trends, the public opinion is informed, how in the case by the publication of the risk warning report.
