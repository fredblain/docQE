A heavy memory
After they were treated more than 60 years confidentially, are the Nazi archives of bath Arolsen which document the destinies of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler's regime now freely accessibly.
Till present the 47 million documents of the archive which are accommodated on a total length of 27 kms in bath Arolsen could not be seen, unless with humanitären  intention, thus individually and namensbezogen, thus on query of a former victim or his members.
Eleven Staaten-darunter commissioned with their management Germany, France, Israel and them has agreed in May, 2006 to make them for researchers and historians accessible.
After the ratification process of this decision was concluded, the opening is valid since yesterday.
Awkward information
The access of the historians to bath Arolsen will enable to pursue investigations, vor to all about the deportations of prisoners, the passengers of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced laborers , explains Reto to masters, leader of these archives who are administered by the international committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Up to short several states, under it also Germany against it, these name-related documents for the general public were still to be made accessible, on account of the awkward character of certain information.
As for example the supposed homosexuality or the spiritual impediment of some deportation victims.
The passenger's lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for practical reason: The civilians who had deported or had been subordinated the hard labor, to find, and to deliver to them, perhaps, an evidence of her arrest to flatten the way for her compensation to them thus.
Still today more than 300 festival employees work on in bath Arolsen ten thousands of personal inquiries.
Still, a part of the scientific community shows only one restricted interest in the access to bath Arolsen.
Man may expect nothing basically new in these documents , had Pr. Wolfgang Benz, leader of the research center for anti-Semitism of the technological university of Berlin, in 2006 explains.
