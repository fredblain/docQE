Climate propaganda
Because the climate debate put the sceptics of the climate change as well as those, with respect to that a social and political debate in the foreground, submits to a pitiless criticism, the movement as whole ones must display a strong cohesion.
Above all if it concerns a leader of the movement who, like in case of head of the provincial government Zapatero, the fight against the climate change for more important holds than the fight of the Islamic terrorism and even suggests concluding a neuen contract with the planet .
This suggestion brings him, nevertheless, in explanation need with regard to the action, or non-action of his government which has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain within the EU stands at the head of the lands which have fulfilled the default of the Kioto protocol in the least one.
Who are the persons responsible for the non-fulfillment of the default on which sectors this is to be led back, and why his government which had suggested Vertrag with the planet  has not stopped this development.
Now, in addition, he is made demonstrate measures against the climate change without circumlocutions to the Spanish citizens from him intended.
Which companies will be concerned by which behavior of the citizens should be changed to which individual and collective economy measures must be carried out and which economic results arise from it.
Precise said who must sacrifice itself and will pay for the rescue of the planet.
Indeed, it has and there will be in future no such explanations.
Just because it is for itself about sacrificing and the payment.
Since the measures which can be used against the climate change really are unpopular.
They are rich in costs, uncomfortable and menacingly for the accounts of the companies and citizens.
Even that of the PSOE suggested gasoline cent seemed to Zapatero electoral-strategically seen so dangerous that he felt constrained to take back the suggestion again.
Now accordingly it is a matter of saving the planet with Nothing, thus with pure propaganda and empty sayings without every real consequences.
With impressive statements, committees, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet the so suitable politician otherwise for electoral campaigns neither must talk, nor accuses, nor demand, follow, instead, however, the demanding issue to decorate the meetings and to inspire others with his gentleness and goodness.
However, this can happen only if the contract does not deviate from his purely virtual nature and also does not give, therefore that the bicycle becomes from now on the only locomotion means or we may refresh ourselves only with a field.
