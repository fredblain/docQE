New fears about natural gas quarrel between Russia and the Ukraine
A new prize quarrel smolders between the Ukraine and Russia what raises the danger that Russian exports are impaired by fuel to Western Europe.
The biggest part of the Russian natural gas exports in the European Union (EU) is escorted through the Ukraine and every quarrel between both nations is very exactly observed.
Kiev has warned about the fact that if Moscow raises the price which it must pay for the natural gas, it will charge for higher transit fees of Russia.
An earlier conflict between both states last year diminished deliveries in the EU states.
The latest quarrel between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time to which the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom try to reach an arrangement on how much the Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom must be calculated to the Ukraine more, because the group has agreed to pay up to 50%, in addition, for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that the Ukraine must pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
" It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in conversations ", the Minister for Economic Affairs of the Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency said Reuters.
" The changing natural gas prices should be connected certainly with our arguments with regard to the height of the transit fees [to Western Europe] over the Ukraine. "
In the last big natural gas quarrel between Moscow and Kiev in January, 2006 Gazprom shortened deliveries in the Ukraine.
This led as a result of to a case of the exports to Western Europe what forced up the prices drastically.
Russian gas puts out a quarter of the care of the European Union.
Russia has the worldwide biggest gas occurence, but a lot of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements his own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
