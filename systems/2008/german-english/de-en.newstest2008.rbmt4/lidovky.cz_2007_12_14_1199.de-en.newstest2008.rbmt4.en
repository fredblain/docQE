Budget is by
Yes, it is created.
The budget is approved.
What is in this household a special?
It is the first household which this government has sketched, and without support of the opposition was accepted by the coalition majority.
For the current year was still approved with support of the ČSSD (social democrats) because him minister Sobotka (from this party) had presented, and which could not allow itself ČSSD, therefore to reject him.
This time as opposed to lively debate before the vote about the motion of no confidence against the government nothing happened dramatic.
The chamber of deputies approved of this traditionally little notable, still extremely significant law in complete silence.
This is paradoxical as it were.
All governance begins and ends with the single chapters and posts of the household whether that likes or not.
The household is an essential component of the policy, however, is covered by the struggle for power of the government and the opposition.
This is a more thankful subject for the media, and, therefore, they dedicate to him more attention.
A quarrel among politicians is much more interesting for the general public than sober figures.
The budgets suffered at the past social-democratic governments from three weak points which the household can remove for 2008 not all at once:
The first one is the high interest of issues which oblige for law and it concerns not only the pensions, but also around the social expenses which the "silent" coalition from ČSSD and KSČM (communist) has decided last year before the choices.
The second one is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. to the budget deficits of the municipalities.
Nevertheless, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This household is public and eingermaßen under control.
However, a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors gave to open other springs for investments except income from taxes, deliveries and bank loans, often unthinkingly the debentures from by which they been to blame for her city halls in the excess.
During the last years they succeeded, these debts by plentiful sales of stocks of the energy nets and other supply networks which they had received in the train of the privatisation from the state to pay off.
Now this spring has already dried up.
As far as we keep only to official and checkable facts, we find out, that:
our economy already for some years, like the rest of the world, a growth phase runs through which boasts ČSSD without respite.
This showed a unique possibility for her governments to fix the public finances.
Instead, these governments been to blame for the state, nevertheless, even more.
Other lands, apart from a few exceptions like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have economized much more rationally than our republic.
This is a gigantic disgrace which is to be ascribed mainly to the earlier governments.
We belong to the lands which, seen in the global graduation, in least by poverty are threatened.
Therefore, no nassiven social programs which were inflated, unfortunately, just during the last years quite superfluous-wise in huge magnitude are necessary.
Even if it has succeeded, a part of the senseless populist issues which were dismissed this year before the choices to glide is clear that if it does not come in the next time for a movement of the pensions entry age and to a pension reform, then any policy ends practically in this land, and, no matter who is in power, nothing but will remain to him pure administering.
It is only easily exaggerated if one says that then from ruling politicians official become who split the biggest part of the inland revenue mechanically on pensions and social expenses.
Therefore, this year's household can be no revolution, but can order only to the displacement of normal issues by duty expenses stop.
The deficit intended for 2008 of 70 billion crowns would be absolutely superfluous if earlier governments had not been economical during the last ten years what only went.
If we do not want that it really arrives that from ruling politicians pure administrative official become, then we must be patient and wish this not too strong coalition government which is aware, however, of that that the state can be economical only so much, as he is able to take in taxes and fees, rest by the preparation of other reform laws.
Only these allow a gradual penetration of a well-balanced budget.
