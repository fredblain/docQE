Spanish private transmitter Telecinco doubles for the first time his stock market value and overtakes therefore his rival Antena 3.
Wir have created it. 
With this sentence the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, with close of the stock market made known his contentment. The transmitter escorted by him had raised his value by double of his rival Antena 3.
Nevertheless, an aspect damped his joy: Das is exactly that what me is injured; not that we a higher growth, but that we lower losses had , he found out.
He stressed that they have much too deeply sunk in spite of the weak market nicht. 
Yesterday Telecinco finished the day with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit diminishes his present this year's losses on 15.66%.
Now according to Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4,488.88 million euros and Mediaset controls the main interest of the capital (52%), and Vocento is involved only with 13%.
Yesterday rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percent points and has to announce since January a loss of a total of 40.5%, so that his market value with 2,193.46 millions amounts to half.
The market value of other listed communication-enterprises, however, rises; in case of from Sogecable on 3.571 millions, with Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) on 2,518.53 millions and with Vocento on 1.779 millions.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it itself um two similar enterprises acts , according to Vasile.
Uncertainly still appears the question in which circumference we can operate really technically on the stock exchange for which price and how we can form it at customer level lucratively.
Telecinco explained his plan one week ago to climb up this year to the first television broadcasting station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. Of this insured Guiseppe Tringali, the managers of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising enterprise of the group.
If the plan should be moved, the transmitter would increase his advertising income in comparison to the 965.4 millions from the year before on 3.6%.
In the case of Antena 3 the net turnover rose by 1.6% during the first nine stock market months (up to 734.4 millions), while the Nettoeinkünfte from the television business could show only one increase of 0.7% (630.4 millions).
The analysts see the main factor for the stock market course better in the comparison of Telecinco with the high Payout-Ratio which the company could show up to the current time: In 2006 veranlasste the enterprise escorted by Alejandro Echevarría a 100-percent declaration of dividend.
Nevertheless, Vasile assures that the Ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
Wir are obliged to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have bragged up to now always substantially more.
I hope that we can satisfy our stockholders this year whose stock values we could already increase by the purchase of 33% of the Endemol shares.
At the moment after statement of the analysts the market shows certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers reduced only recently his profit calculation with Telecinco for this year about 4% and for 2009 about 7%.
This is the result of the shortening of the prospective increase rate which will go back in 2008 from 10.5% to 8.4% and in 2009 from 5.5% on 5.1%.
This has also lowered the prospective profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 about 4.5% and for 2009 about 7.5%.
3 options.

Ibersecurities: places on his high actual yield and his lasting potential and recommends, hence, the purchase of both stocks.
2.

3.
JPMorgan: recommends in view of the ähnlichen menaces  (saturated market and worse economic climate) the expectations in both cases to put back
