Polívka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the quarrel around the brand " kingdom of Walachei ".
Indeed, of the judge in the municipal court in Ostrava according to he has used as more first the name " Walachischer of king ", but the project had built up in long-standing work a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor.
Today Polívka did not take part in the negotiations.
However, according to his lawyer the thing is not probably finished with it and his mandator will probably insert appeal.
" The quarrel goes about the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitär, " said after the negotiations Polívkas lawyer.
Everything fancied just this actor and comedian with the words " Walachisches of kingdom ".
Of the same opinion is also Harabiš.
" We have an almost ten-year-old work behind ourselves.
He said monetary procurement and drafts of the activities, ".
To him according to the occasion is a quarrel around money.
" After years has struck them that the project is successful and that they could also have a little bit of it.
They want to win parasitär in our work, " he repeated.
Lucrative business
According to the court used Polívka the name " Walachischer of king " for the first time in one of his telecasts.
In 1993 actor Radoslav Brzobohat ý crowned him.
At that time, however, this did not hang together with the intention to found a fictive kingdom.
Some years later there came Harabiš on the thought to spend walachische passports.
From an originally funny action there crystallized a business and an enterprise activity out to which Harabiš connected then the foundation of the company " Walachisches of kingdom ".
In 1997 Polívka of the use of his name and his signature agreed in the passports and offered to her owners even reductions in the visit of his farm and his stage performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today the judge also stated that Harabiš used only the bare idea which has publicized Polívka in the broadcasting "manege" for his enterprise intentions.
" The popularity Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the walachischen kingdom, " said the judge.
However, she added that the soul of the project Harabiš and his team are which would have intensely devoted themselves to him.
The collaboration of the parties fallen out today lasted up to 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there started to pile up between Polívka and Harabiš the disputes which culminated in the dismissal " king Boleslavs I. electively up to the Saint Nimmerleins day ".
Then the guide roller took up on suggestion Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as a queen mother.
Then in 2002 Polívka submitted the complaint which rejected the court today against Harabiš and his company.
The competition prepared by Harabiš could bring clearness in the quarrel around the throne and half a princess.
A new king should arise from it.
He did not want to betray details and an appointment yet.
" We want to rush nothing.
It should be such a thing like the king's relocation in the Walachei.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Also Mr. Polívka can announce himself with it quietly, " Harabiš added.
