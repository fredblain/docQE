The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria came in Bagdad yesterday, with a stream of expelled whose finances or Visas have run out, and other which hoped that the town returns to normality.
Some had even come back to fight against the rebels whom they had expelled from her houses.
In the bus railway station Mansour, even before of the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was actively with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
" I decided to go to Syria, after they had killed many doctors in Bagdad ", said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a sunnitischer doctor.
" Today I came back, because of that what I have seen on television and what I have read in the newspaper, about that what has happened in Bagdad, and how it would be sure now. "
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people ", he said, in relation on the Schiitenmilizen of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, has ordered to put back his forces at the current time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the prevailing sunnitische part of Amariyah, returned with his both children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because to work the regime Iraqi not permissibly.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to say to him that a local militia supported by the USA has served to expel al-Qaeda from her bastion in the west of the capital, and penetrated him to the return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader sunnitischen and Shiite trunk which had been expelled from his house in Sleikh in the north of Bagdad by an attack with grenades, after he had requested his fellow citizens to the fight Al-Qaidas.
He was come back to fight.

But more spoke of having been forced home by visa problems and drying up finances in Damascus where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled during the last years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old triple father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, the Syrian government had requested to cover visa restrictions for the refugees to force people to the return.
More than 2,5 million people have presumably fled from the sectarian Todesschwadronen in the land.
" It well went for us to al-Maliki Syria visited and the government urged to the Iraqis no more visas to give to force them to the return in Iraq ", said of the sunnitischen pensioners.
" I cannot trust to a government which supports the criminals, my house of burned down ones, after I left. "
A part of the reason for the decline of the power is that Sunniten from Shiite residential areas and vice versa were expelled what led to the creation of many places where tensions have decreased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will poke sectarian tensions again and it will come to conflicts.
