Today for the fact that she has given a name to a teddy bear it was brought forward to a court in Khartum.
According to information of her lawyer the British teacher who had been accused in Sudan of insults of Islam was condemned on the Thursday evening by a court in Khartum by 15 days of custody and next expulsion.
The Briton was accused to have permitted 6 to seven-year-old pupils, to give the name Mahomet to a teddy bear, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She would have earned to be whipped.
After parents of pupils had complained several times with the Sudanese Ministry of Education and the Arts, the 54-year-old basic schoolteacher who was active in the Unity High School of Khartum on Sunday was taken up with herself at home and was accused according to the article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code of the insults of Islam.
Really this affair takes her beginning in September when the teacher asks theirs 6 to seven-year-old pupil to select a name for the Klassenteddy.
Die children suggest eight names, under it Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed , reports headmaster Robert Boules.
In the end when the class votes, 20 of 23 children Mohammed choose as the dearest given name.
Absolutely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a given name very frequent in Sudan.
Afterwards the children have provided a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the picture signature Mein name is Mohammed .
The bear itself carried no sign with this name, but the problem is quite easy that the representation of the Islamic prophet is looked as insults of Islam.
One of the Moslem colleagues of Gillian Gibbons who informs at the same school in Sudan explained, he knows them well, and she would never have something would have acted with which she could step to a religious belief too near, ich regrets only that she has asked the children to be right for a name, on this occasion, , his opinion it concerns only a unschuldigen mistake .
An opinion which numerous pupils of the teacher divide who speaks this as sehr carefully towards her pupils  and as Person, never in the class about religion  describe.
One thinks that the given name Mohammed is at the same time also in Great Britain in the second most frequent given second name for which into English 14 different manners of writing exist.
This often from Moslem families well-chosen given name counts as a kind of deference to the prophet (he is often given to the first-born of a family).
But how are the rules concerning the use of this given name?
May one give him, for instance, to toys?
This is naturally a question of the interpretation.
