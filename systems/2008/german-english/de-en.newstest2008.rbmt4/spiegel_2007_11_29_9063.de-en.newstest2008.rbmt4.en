Venus is the infernal twin of the earth
The Venus is intended in spite of her life-hostile atmosphere of the earth more similarly than up to now: The European space probe " Venus of express train " has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind whirl to the Pole how they appear in winter also on the earth.
For nearly three decades scientists suppose that it flashes on the Venus.
Now the European probe has produced " Venus of express train " the proof - she tracked down electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The flashes on the Venus shoot at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel about the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory" flashes let the life on the earth originate: Thunderstorms should have stimulated in the ocean reactions which led to the education of amino acids, the stones of the life.
Not thus on the Venus: " If was one day life there, it must have been in the very early history ", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington.
Today there might be on the surface of the Venus barely something living: The atmosphere is thicker about hundred times than on the earth, there rule every now and then temperatures of 500 degrees.
" The Venus is maybe the devil's twin of the earth, but she is a twin ", said Russian
Why the Venus which is so similar to the earth in mass and size has hit such a totally other development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The start of " Venus of express train " in November, 2005 was a landmark for the Venus research, because since beginning of the nineties no more probe was on the move specially to the investigation of this planet.
The newest research results which are introduced now in several "Nature" articles underline in the opinion of the researchers not only the uniqueness of the Venus within the solar system.
" You also show that the common characteristics of our neighbouring planet with the earth are bigger than at first accepted ", informs the Esa.
Thus the researchers also found a cloud whirlpool in the South Pole which still turns substantially faster beside the already known whirlwind on the North Pole.
The phenomenon reminds of airflows on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni about the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The most second-internal planet of the solar system has almost the same mass like the earth and is big with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers almost just.
The planet also called morning or evening star circles in just 225 days round the sun.
However, he turns much more slowly on himself: A Venus day lasts 243 earth days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees centigrade and a pressure of 92 reminds cash barely of the earth, scientists assume from the fact that both planets have originated under quite similar conditions.
On both water collected which remained on the earth in oceans, however, on the Venus got lost in the space.
And while carbon dioxide on the earth is fixed in carbonate rocks, it puts out on the Venus the large part of the atmosphere.
