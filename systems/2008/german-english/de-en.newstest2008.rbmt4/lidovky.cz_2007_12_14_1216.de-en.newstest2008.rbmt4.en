Banks want to master crisis
The American Federal reserve, the European central bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis at the finance markets.
Thus more than 100 billion dollars will reach by means of auctions the currency markets.
On these auctions the banks auction interest rates for which they are ready to borrow mutually money.
For example, sends the American Fed 40 billion dollars on auction, other 24 forks out them for the European and the Swiss central bank.
It is after the posters 11th September the first time, that the central banks of the single states on a so co-ordinated action to the defense or Abmilderung of the results of a financial crisis to some.
" This step should remove the biggest difficulties of the economy, thus the increasing lack of the freely available capital which the banks can lend " wrote in a report for his customer Bernard Baumohl about consultation company Economic Outlook Group.
" The co-ordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelyhood of a recession in the USA of 65% on about 50%, " Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have lost because of not served loans already about 60 billion dollars, above all in the United States.
Analysts expect even other billion losses.
" " The central banks must really have had fear of what can still follow everything when decided on this action, " said the chief small farmer of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
" It looks in such a way that the position is really bad, " he repeated.
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves hard have access to loans, for her customers loans become also more expensive.
This would reduce the consumption and overthrow the American economy in a recession, possibly with consequences on the economic growth in the whole world.
The central banks have decided on it, after they had not succeeded, the so-called. To lower LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate which is used with the monetary rental company between banks.
This means that the banks were afraid constantly to borrow money mutually, and this although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the autumn her interest rates several times had lowered.
" This will have the same effect like an other sinking of the interest rates, " Greg Salvaggio of tense Consulting of the agency said Reuters.
Some analysts are of the view that this step of the central banks contributes to the Aufheizung of the crisis because he does not solve the basic problem, namely the case of the property market in the USA.
