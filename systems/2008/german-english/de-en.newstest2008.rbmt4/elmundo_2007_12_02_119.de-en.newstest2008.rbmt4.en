Which assurance is suited for me best of all?
The KFZ assurance which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver contain a high expense whose height takes down rerum on different factors, among other things from age, gender, time of the production of the driving licence, marital status, kind of the car to be insured and his use, etc.
A car is to be owned only the beginning.
Since the suitable KFZ assurance is to be found even difficult as the right vehicle model.
At first once must be clear to one with which we have to do it here.
A car insurance is an arrangement between an insurance society and a policy holder.
This arrangement is held on in writing by means of a contract of insurance which fixes that the society receives the arranged insurance premium and is obliged as a countermove to present the suitable sum of indemnity with a case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an assurance which consists by several factors, among other things age, gender, time of the production of the driving licence, marital status, kind of the vehicle to be insured or his use.
The insurance enterprises settle her prices accordingly of the statistics, so that with a higher accident danger also higher contribution payments become due.
That's why less contribution payments must perform about 25-year-old as well as women, because statistics prove that these groups show a lower accident rate thanks to her care.
The same also counts to married persons, because these incline after statement of the statistical values and, therefore, also after conviction of the enterprises, to less accidents like single.
The use which is attached to the vehicle impairs the frequency of the driving and with it also the likelyhood of an accident.
The more often the use, the more probably the damage.
By the installation of the premium the assurances must take into consideration a whole row of points.
That's why the driver must also study the situation thoroughly to select exactly the car insurance which meets his personal needs in the earliest one.
We list at this point now the most important points which one should consider with the choice of an assurance to be able to meet not only an achievement, but also a choice oriented to price.
Among 25-year-old hit with a choice of an inexpensive assurance on numerous obstacles, as for example the low driving practise and junge  driving licence.
Even if it was the best for an ideal insurance cover to conclude a full fully comprehensive insurance, there are still less expensive alternatives.
The careful drivers can select a Vollkasko with deduction, so that the achievements of a full fully comprehensive insurance are covered, indeed, but are offered for a low price.
Of such type from contract contain that the customer must pay a part of the amount resulted by the damage himself.
Der amount is fixed before end of the contract and with the help of the height of the insurance premium. This is higher the more slightly the sum to be paid , explains Luis Noguera, general agent of Spain with ridge Europe, to a mediation enterprise for on-line assurances.
Another option is the enlarged assurance which insures of the customer against external accident damages, not, nevertheless, against the damages resulted in own car.
In addition, theft, fire and vehicle loss would cover of such type of the assurance.
Here a council.
If you are 25 years old under, it lies in your hand to lower the insurance costs; thus your credit increases, while you try to go carefully and to avoid accidents.
A credit is a lowering of the base rate at the suitable insurance society.
On the contrary in addition contain a penal payment an increase of aforesaid rate.
Die height credits and penal payments depend on the society and their yields.
If the enterprise has a year rich in yield behind itself, it can allow itself to raise the bonus payments , explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-annual brand is crossed, it is to be concluded for the drivers more simply a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practise the accident rate sinks.
Therefore it is the most sensible to decide on a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction.
Normalerweise can pull the youngsters no use from her present experience, in case of an accident as well as at the time of the driving , does not explain the Spanish director of the European enterprise, and adds that the majority of the accidents occur in the second practise year, after Angst of the beginner  was filed.
Still it is with a married customer who owns no children to conclude more advisable, a full fully comprehensive insurance; of course only if it also admits the financial situation of the suitable person.
On the part of the insurers married couples with children count as the customers with the slightest accident rate, and accordingly low her contribution payments also fall out.
In this case a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction (with an amount about the 300 euros) would be the best option. In the case that one has received a high credit, an enlarged assurance which starts only to the third vehicle year is recommended.
Sie go all together more relaxed and own a bigger purchasing power which allows to them to attach a higher contribution payment , ascertains Luis Noguera.
For pensioners it is obvious to conclude a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction (with an amount about the 150 euros), or an enlarged assurance which starts only with an enough high credit.
At last one must stick that the car insurance is something very important, not only because she protects the driver against possible accident damages, but also because she rescues high costs which require that a thorough choice is dripped which corresponds to our personal situation.
