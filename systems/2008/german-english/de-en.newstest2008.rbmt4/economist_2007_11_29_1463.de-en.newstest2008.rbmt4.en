Pains of the Labour party
Gordon Brown has discovered still an other pit to the Hineinfallen; his way from this remains the same.
For British scandals this is not especially slippery.
No titles of nobility seem to have been sucked sold, politician's Paris hotel calculations paid-uply, no illegitimate toes.
But the disclosure that a rich businessman has veiled donations for the British ruling Labour party about more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) more than four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to announce this is something without the fought Gordon Brown would have well got by.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had avoided the demand for a choice, in stupid way the intelligence of the Britons insulting, while he stated that opinion polls had not influenced this decision there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable who expressed keen representation chairperson of the Liberally democrats, it in increasing litre of beer the once dreaded Brown of Stalin has developed to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern rock, a groggy bank, showed regulatorische weakness and bad judgment property under bombardment.
Badly thought-out suggestions for the change of the tax laws have raised enterprise federations against the government.
The tax-official loss of personal data of 25 million people indicated inconceivable administrative botch-ups.
A trio of generals in the retirement started to an uprising in the Upper House in protest against shortenings of military expenses: To be a minister of the armed forces, they stated, is a part-time job.
Now there are the varied donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labours secretary general (and her earlier fulfilment leader) has already withdrawn.
Nothing means of the fact that Brown opens definitely in the direction of exit.
Governments can still reach a turning point, after they it feel impossibly to rule.
Neither may trust nor people to politicians, hold back, however, them ordinarily her scepticism if a new troop seizes the office.
If it is clear once that it is unlikely that a prime minister improves the situation, and he does not need to be present yet long, this deferment is over: the civil service starts to become leaking; the cabinet ministers start to chat; the press looks for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way the position of Brown is especially difficult because it cannot claim in contrast to other political leaders to be a new broom.
So with pleasure he would deny Tony Blair, he was his first lieutenant.
The problems with Northern to rock and the tax competence documents, for example, hang together with decisions which Brown met as a chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if was involved not directly in Blair's bad luck - as with the long " money for title of nobility " investigation of political party financing - the voters possibly assume from the fact that he was it.
Nevertheless, Browns position is not so bad completely as it looks
The misdemeanours are not so awful as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, nobody has died, or was totally swindled out.
And the antidote, painfully how it may be is to be delivered what Browns have always promised of course Stalinist trends: A reliable, respectable and slightly crude government.
The new fuss around political donations is a good example.
Garboeske Abrahams which compares his donations to his charitable gifts says he wishes no public recognition for his goodwill.
This may be maybe like that, but the decision on it was not entitled to him.
The laws against anonymity for big political contribution payers are clear and they exist for unequivocal reason: the general public has a right on to know who can buy itself access to those which govern the land.
Watts, that says he would have known about Abrahams arrangement, but not that she is unlawful, will have to position itself naturally of some questions; exactly like Jon Mendlesohn, Labours Hauptfinanzeintreiber whom about the odd donations was told in October.
However, up to now Brown is not involved: There is nothing that points to the fact that he knew about this confusion, although the biggest part of the payments was done after his office takeover in June.
Up to now the prime minister has done half of the work.
He has condemned fast the injury of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by the griffins after a known instrument, has led to an investigating committee on the subject - to fill the measure, from a bishop in the retirement and a judge.
In this case the " apprenticeships to be pulled from it " are not complicated very much.
If the law was broken, it is a thing for the police.
Apart from the fact there are other things Mr. Brown must do to find how a little bit one permanent chairpersons for the independent committee for standards in the public life which is unoccupied since six months and to progress with a drastic reform of political party financing.
This would require from the hard liners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and to give up, perhaps, the special financial respect with the trade unions - the bitter pills for a party member like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some biased facts.
Now the conservatives have a clear guidance in the opinion polls; he has to win back two years around voters; and the only way, as he can reach a victory, is by indisputable righteousness and respectable competence.
