Klaus: Debates of the ecologists are unplausible
Global climate changes damage supposedly to developing countries mostly.
President VÃ¡clav Klaus commented again to the problems of the global warming.
Now the criticism referred to the coming to an end international conference of UN to the climate change on Bali.
In Vienna where he presented his book " blue, no green planet " he explained that the debates of the ecologists are unplausible.
According to Klaus not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of not-government organizations, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric which she accompanies, and the reality.
" The debate there is unstructured, these are word fireworks, the only substitute is for a real solution of present problems, " said Klaus.
The Czech president stressed by the image of his book that his subject is very important for him, and that he is involved in it, therefore, so.
He also expressed his contentment about the fact that his book appears in German translation because " I often hit on caricatures of my views. "
Now prospective customers could read up his setting undistorted.
Klaus reminded of the fact that it is no Klimatologe, but he has to his opinion after sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He is, in the end, a graduate to understand capable, technical treatises and to judge, experience with statistics has and is also an economist.
He called the thesis main statement of the book that the climate changes constantly and that his changes are normal that there is no correspondent opinion among the scientists to the global warming that the results of the present changes are big not too and serious and showed therefore no menace, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are is superfluous, luxurious ineffectively and unacceptably.
In addition, he holds it as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen, for unacceptable to force upon other unproven views he considers as a dangerous restriction of the freedom.
On questions of persons present he explained repeatedly, he is not against a " reasonable environment protection, but against militant ecological activists who take no consideration on the relation between expenditure and yield. "
About the same subject Klaus had spoken in Vienna already two months ago in the Hayek institute.
