Everything still openly
Mitt Romey said, he holds it of no presidential candidate worthy to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the republican candidate agreed for the presidency, in the end to position himself to a debate on YouTube in which normal voters take up questions on video and submit to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions which were thrown up on the Wednesday evening, 28th November, were as ridiculous as the snowman, the democrats about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party conferred with.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time exactly the state of the republican party which opens in the choices next year.
It is not known, precise like the producers by CNN, which the debate to the cosupported ones which selected the beginning candidate YouTube to be shown clips.
However, in the first half an hour of the debate which was dedicated longest to a single subject immigration stood in the center.
The subject is one of the most efficient subjects for Republicans.
A group of undecided voters asked the CNN to serve a WÃ¤hlscheibe if they heard things which they liked: The television company noted points of the approval as the candidates strictly about the borders spoke.
The most sharp and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner, and Romney who has pushed in the determining surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire forwards.
Giuliani tries to shake off the call, he has been compliantly concerning unlawful immigration when he was a mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in he the former governor of Massachusetts accused, unlawful immigrants for work on his house to have put.
The both sat down especially violently apart as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates gave an "Amnestie" (the unlawful a regular status and the possibility on the citizenship) would support.
More unimportant candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressional representative, and Tom Tancredo, a congressional representative from Colorado, it succeeded with this subject nachzuhaken.
None of both men has serious chances with the nomination, but both remain in the running, maybe because they have lashed out earlier and harder than other on the immigration kettledrum.
At least in the area of the immigration the candidates divide on the whole the same views: more sharp borders, intolerance towards unlawful migrants.
This subject, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other worries about the rest of the world, the differences help the Republicans between liberal and Christian conservative to forget or to minimize.
But the debate became unambiguously problematic as other subjects were brought up.
Mr. Giuliani was asked, which is why he has supported weapon restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be looked as a torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led to the fact that Giuliani represented the point of view that although the Bible is his preferential book, he thinks the history of Jonah and the whale maybe not literal.
Another questioner asked whether of Jesus the capital punishment supported.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations on the first place in a recently carried out survey in Iowa thanks to his Christian Konservativismus existing for a long time - said that the capital punishment is painful, but necessary.
When he was pushed for whether of Jesus she would recommend, he laughed at it and said of Jesus was to be promoted too intelligently around himself around a political office.
The running stays open extremely far.
Huckabees rise in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls to the latest donation success and his thunderous applauses in the debate of Wednesday.
These both are sent up from Nothing because both wings of the party could not agree up to now yet on one of the more known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000 a candidate has the party from the outset and persuasive combinedly with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time is split the party and the result is not clear by far.
