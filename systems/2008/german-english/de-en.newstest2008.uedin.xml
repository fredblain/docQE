<seg id="1"> The most expensive Auchan, Tesco, increased by almost a fifth</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the Hypermarkets Budaörser Handelsgebiet also have this year, the average increase in price of 16% last year, with the difference that it this year no increase in VAT.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Article from Napi Gazdaság</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In the price of the usual Budaörser Handelsdreieck Weihnachtskorbes has the 'Napi' also increased 16% this year, but in all Hypermärkten prices have been recorded over 1000 HUF.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After the prices in the Lebensmittelmärkten last December 'davongaloppiert', which is not prozentuell rise drastically, compared with the already high, former initial level.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, it is intended as a deterrent to the consumer that what they had paid last year far below 9 000 HUF, this year, not even for 10, 000 HUF available.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The price of the 'Napi' Warenkorbs exceeded the magic 10 000-HUF-border at least 91 HUF investigated in the markets.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The high price was 10.573 HUF.</seg>
<seg id="9"> (In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The price of fish were almost Unicum and living on Vorjahresniveau, greatly increased prices for Putenbrustfilets, and on the other hand, are Nuss poppy.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Prices for bread flour, and in line with the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, however, there have been Auchan 1kg Brotwecken for 139 Ft.</seg>
<seg id="12"> There was no competition-related decline in the product to below 200 Ft.</seg>
<seg id="13"> It is also surprising here two, the price of a litre of Coca-Cola Pfandflasche from 200 Ft was, therefore, including the drink deposit cost only HUF 257.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless, this year in the 'Napi' Warenkorbs-comparison Auchan raised the most expensive, and Cora most favourable.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Our calculations have shown that Cora prices have in the 'Napi' shopping basket Weihnachtspreisen last year with the 15, while each Auchan Tesco and increased by 18%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of last year and this year was the most expensive of 12%, while the increase between billigstem shopping basket of last year and the current year teuerstem representing 21%.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The average price rises 1.480,00 HUF was.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The average increase in the last year was still 1.206,00 Ft, however, the Mehrwertsteuererhöhung price was last Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="19"> It is precisely this process has taken the trade furiously: it would seem that the Warenhäuser could not decide what Preisspanne should apply in the individual articles, since the effects of the increase in the consumption have incalculable.</seg>
<seg id="20"> (If the dealer does the circulation of a product bad, it can fall by a substantial profits in the Preisspanne, after the Verkehrsintensität.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Mehwertsteuer-the rise of the 'Napi' Warenkorbes last year was so radical that the most expensive element was the value of 2006 by 1720 Ft exceeded, whereas the price difference in the cheapest merely basket 844 Ft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This year, have not been observed such extremes, since the most expensive basket 1.630,00 Ft to cost more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest there was an increase of 1.284,00 Ft.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In comparison with the last two Weihnachtssaisons was a disastrous increase, the price of day-to-day consumer article in the Hypermärkten has risen in less than 20 months by more than 30%.</seg>
<seg id="24"> (confirmed this once again not necessarily the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic the Statistical Office in the period of 12 months, found a more than 30% rise.</seg>
<seg id="25"> So in addition to flour in around in eggs.)</seg>
<seg id="26"> However, you look into the 'Napi' shopping basket, it seems almost impossible to pursue, because the price level of last year expensive product itself has risen in the worst case, little more than 10%.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Obviously Mehllieferanten are in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten - after all, they were able to pass the drastic increase in prices to the multinationals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> In the golden Handelsdreieck aren't complain; it is constantly reported by good years.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three Warenhäusern do not look more on prices.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It is purchased from all large quantities, sustainable food goes on Paletten on the Ladentische.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Wednesday morning there was in all three Warenhäusern endless queues in the Kassa when the number of customers suddenly exploded.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Nevertheless, it is reported by the country a smaller Kundenfrequenz, so many multinationals in the Meinungsforschern complain that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, and not only in food, but also in sustainable consumer goods.</seg>

<seg id="1"> In many places Desinfektionsmitteln cuts in</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Today, more than a thousand have been registered infections in hospitals, which were due to the improper use of antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding in the beds, congestion of staff, factors which are not conducive to combat the infection, the chief doctor of the National Epidemiologiezentrums.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Cuts are being made in many places in the Desinfektionsmitteln.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Traumatologie-department of a hospital János MRSA-infection has recently been diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The antibiotic-resistant pasteurisation has been found in a male patients, was taken after a serious accident to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The patient has been isolated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The injured a serious car accident was released from the hospital, shortly afterwards, the man who had to return with a MRSA-infection. An important operation could be because of the Bakteriums since that is still in the body of the patients, carried out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Until 10 December this year to the National Nosocomialis infections generated from hospitals 1094 by multi-resistant strains reported Surveillance System, the chief doctor of the National Epidemiologiezentrums, Karolina Böröcz.</seg>
<seg id="11"> So many, through multi-resistant strains caused infections were to be registered in the hospitals in security, but the number of unreported cases is higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Approximately two-thirds of the infection (683 cases) the MRSA, triggered against Methicillin-Oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The pasteurisation Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is approximately one-third of people in their nose, without it would cause a disease.</seg>
<seg id="14"> SA-related infections (such as Halsentzündung, Mandelentzündung, inflammations of skin or wounds) usually respond to antibiotics, they are good it can be cured.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> However, the funds be extent too high or inadequately applied, antibiotic-resistant, which are under appropriate conditions in the hospitals quickly arise from the good respondierenden bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Particularly in patients with geschwächtem, or permanently bad funktionierendem immune system, but also in older, or patients with little weight these bacteria can serious infections, such as Blutvergiftung Wundinfektion or, in other words Sepsis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The head of the medical János hospital, the MRSA-infection is nothing special that such incidents are Krankehausalltag.</seg>
<seg id="18"> We should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte Tibor MRSA Nyulasi - there are not only there, where they will not be sought.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Become resistant to antibiotics</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> 'such patients are isolated, and health care personnel bears Gummihandschuhe and masks of supplies, and we have the necessary for the treatment of antibiotics' - so Tibor Nyulasi.</seg>
<seg id="21"> In its Einlieferung hospital patients to be investigated MRSA, however, not always an infection can be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Rarely Probenentnahmen to</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals, would be avoided, however, the current conditions and conditions are unfavourable to the control of the creation or the spread of the virus multi-resistant, says Karolina Böröcz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> After this infection in hospitals and Altersheimen occurs, should the eingelieferten Spitäler MRSA-infected patients investigate and isolate immediately.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In the Hungarian hospitals microbiological practice not, however, being so often.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Not least because it on the part of the state Krankenkasse, no subsidies for this study.</seg>
<seg id="27"> The majority of cases, therefore, only then will come to light, if a patient is already a bemerkbare MRSA-infection, the head of the medical Epidemiologiezentrums.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Antibiotic treatments should be targeted, that is to say, microbiological studies are necessary, so that there are no resistance against the resources, however, this directive will be respected by hospitals, not always.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Under the ambulanten, or in the service of the patients microbiological Probenentnahmen are even less so Karolina Böröcz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In the Desinfektionsmitteln savings</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Scientific evidence demonstrates that MRSA patients from one to the other will be entrusted to most of nursing staff.</seg>
<seg id="33"> That is precisely why the Händewaschen, or the wearing of gloves and masks is of great importance, however, there are also serious shortcomings in this area in the hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> MRSA is transmitted through Tröpfcheninfektion or contact in the domestic hospitals do not always have the possibility, however, to isolate the infected patients.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The rooms are often overcrowded, ranked the beds close to each other, although it should be epidemiological point of view between them from a distance of at least 1.5 metres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> As Karolina Böröcz points out, it is, unfortunately, in the less well financially the hospitals even that savings would be made on Desinfektionsmitteln, there are few managers, many patients - all factors that encourage the emergence of infection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Such infections are demonstrably far less frequently, or can be stopped the further spread of the virus, where these protective measures are complied with, Karolina Böröcz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Emphasising MRSA against</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> MRSA-infections to manage the health insurance caused enormous costs, so they will be combatted everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="40"> In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or their containment was recorded in the legislative programme.</seg>
<seg id="41"> After the first signs of the programme is successful, as publizierte show data, the trend of MRSA-infections in England is falling.</seg>
<seg id="42"> The European Centre for disease prevention (ECDC)), the prevention of the creation of multi-resistant cause (including MRSA, and the prevention of diseases in hospitals to one of its priorities.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Hungarian Fodor and the six percentage points</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> As Minister for the Environment Gábor Fodor presentation, the meeting of experts on Tuesday at the end, and the debate on the international climate regime post-2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts and politicians discuss from 192 countries on the road map of Bali, in which the emissionsreduzierenden measures are laid down for the period after 2012, after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.</seg>
<seg id="4"> At the moment, a heated debate between industrialised countries and developing countries is in progress.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The United States have already announced that they want to have concrete figures not negotiate, but it would be prepared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels by 25-40%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The other major question the Conference is whether the industrialised countries are ready, apart from the reduction of emissions in the developing countries, both financially and to support technologically.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It has also been reached an agreement on the support of developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Kyoto Protocol has insinuated adjustment fund should be managed by a 16-köpfigen Council, probably in the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) of the UN, as in the 'Piac is recorded és profit'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Six per cent of Hungary</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Environment Gábor Fodor supported on behalf of Hungary, the commitment of the EU to maintain its leading role in global climate protection measures, and to achieve a new international agreement until 2009.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Minister has stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 (20% compared to 1990), irrespective of whether the 'agreement after 2012 will' made successful or not, and even the European Union would be prepared to commit itself to a 30% reduction soferne other large industrialized countries of the world, or developing countries are also prepared to comply with their obligations and responsibly.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Gábor Fodor emphasised that the objective of the Member States that have joined in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU had with their then 15 Member States already to a minus by 8%.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The target for Hungary is the reduction of greenhouse gases by 6% compared to the years of 1985-87 - a figure that will meet the country, as is widely reported in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The stakes are high in Bali - which, after all, is the long-term international climate policy agreement has to be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly only after 2012 would enter into force, and in this case the Kyoto Protocol Reduktionsvorhaben not renewed, international Emissionsreduktionssystem, also stressed the importance of the IPCC, the international climate change by the Nobel Peace Prize excellent scientific Committee of the UN in its recent report.</seg>
<seg id="15"> This would delay the emission levels, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 ° C would be inevitable, which according to the Wissenschaftern extremely serious and irreparable consequences.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Political plans: Hungarian guard Staatsrisiko increased</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the view of the department for risk analysis Analysing) (Risk-division of political action plans in this August, with the support of the 'movement for a better Hungary' formed Hungarian guard have increased the risk of Hungary and of the region in several respects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the 'Risikowarnungs report' of the Institute it means, among other things: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk is the 'tightening up of the existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and non-Zigeunerbevölkerung in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, probably at the provocation of a dispute of this kind, the one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> As has already been mentioned, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "persons of public life have left to the discussion of the Roma issue representatives of radical political groups who have built their political strategy on the Roma Hungary-contrast '.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It is believed that this aggravate the problem, make the sensible dialogue impossible, would benefit foot injuries, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Forschungsinsitut ausserdem believes that the activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, 'damaging the image of Hungary abroad, particularly as regards the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Let us remind ourselves that, since the autumn of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary is constantly on the rise, so that 2007 several since summer, founded 'national Selbstverteidigungsverein' ablaze organisations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> 'these groups have in common is that they be defined in each case as a civil organisation, while about them openly to prepare their members to - sometimes armed - civil defence tasks, defence, Ordnungshütung), by invoking the ineffectiveness of the police, the army, or to the state itself (', '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> And further: all of this is in accordance with the method which tried to disguise different, to the political and Parteiverdrossenheit the population-based, political aspirations as civil initiative.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The emphasis on the civilian nature and the Vereinsform serve not just the circumvention of legal obstacles, which could in the wake of the registration appear in court - it is also a political strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> As suggested in the analysis of the activities of the Hungarian guard constitute a risikoerhöhenden factor for the relations with neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In recent months, the Hungarian guard was quoted in several of its neighbours as a potential source, some ultra-nationalist politicians in certain countries of the creation of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian-policy.</seg>
<seg id="14"> All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region '-'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> From the point of view of the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian guard not into East in central Europe, so the political risk has grown for the region as a whole.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As has already been mentioned, the activities of the Hungarian guard are Bulgarischen comparable with those of the National Guard, whose establishment in August 2007 has announced by the extreme right-wing Bulgarischen National Union (BNU).</seg>
<seg id="17"> In the light of the emergence of the Bulgarian guard the Roma Massenausschreitungen that have taken place in a regeneration of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BNU has noted the incidents in the same way as the basis for establishing the Guard, with the argument that the aim of the organisation is the 'national protection'.</seg>
<seg id="19"> In their view, was in the last 17 years a genuine 'Zigeunerterror' in Bulgaria, the government has, however, remained indifferent and - as political plans.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And further: the initiative of contract had a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As I have said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is shown by the fact that some of the Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to Widerstandszwecken to set up their own guards.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Since the activities of the Hungarian guard so far shows many similarities with which the Bulgarischen Guard it is not to exclude that the Hungarian Roma react with the Organisieren their own protection to the threats, it says in the case of political Risikowarnungsbericht plans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Attila Juhász, Forschungsdirektor in political plans said on the question of the report: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the Forschungsinstitutes.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Every year, would be published Risikoanalyseberichte and risk-changing tendencies should be clear, public opinion will be kept informed, as in the case of the publication of the Risikowarnberichtes.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Also in the EU and in America something else we understand by 'holiday'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Hungarian legal system to distinguish between Staatsfeiertagen and labour-free days.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Arbeitsfreie days are mostly church holidays or are with major historic events in context.</seg>
<seg id="6"> For example, we are celebrating New Year: both the last day of the old, as well as from the first day of the new year are labour-free days - the latter alone, so that the New Year's Eve-Feiernden sit.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Throughout the year, we have a total of fourteen holidays.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Staatsfeiertage are the 15 March, which is reminiscent of the 1848 revolution, and of 23 October, the day of the revolution of 1956.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On 20 August is the formation of a state, on 1 May, the work celebrated, on 1 and 2 November we remember our deaths.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In addition, there are two holidays to Easter, Pfingsten and Christmas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Since our Heads of State, national or religious holidays are rarely on a weekend, the practice of 'working day-postponement' has proved its worth in the cases in which we would work before or after the holiday just one day.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The price of extended weekends is, however, that we have to work against the Samstagen very well, or go to school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> When this day, before or after the holiday, should be dealt with at the end of the day, will be set by the ministers for many years in a regulation of our own.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The legislation applies to all employers and employees, for public equally employees and officials of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="15"> With the exception of companies and institutions, in which the operation without interruption, will continue in the holidays, are only.</seg>
<seg id="16"> This is the only by working order at the end of the year the holidays rather confused, from 24 December, life will formally here at home, because most of the days Zeitausgleich between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or has been abolished for holidays.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In the next year, more holidays in the Wochenmitte, or at the end of the week, so that there will be less Umdisponierungen during the days when this year.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The calendar will first of all around the day of work 'to', so that people can remain the same four days in a row at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saturday, 26 April will be a working day, so that the Friday, 2 May will be a day of rest.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The second re-planning is connected with the holiday on 23 October, on Saturday, 18 October, we will have to the Friday 24 October through beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The end of the year, however, will be completely in the sign of holidays, are all from 24 December, and are even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24"> Balázs Zságer: the term 'Schichtmusik' means not just me a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In my opinion, there are two main castes in the Popmusik, and not mainstream and Underground or alternative and pop but Kommerziell and honest.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Even the so-called 'alternative' or 'Underground music seicht and can be meaningless, just as they can be but only for the sale of produced, which makes them to commercial music.</seg>
<seg id="27"> It is also a good pop-number from an honest motive.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The receptiveness of Hörers also works in accordance with this principle, regardless of the languages and borders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Hvg.hu: you You a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience your music to?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Example Zs.: abroad, in particular to the west of the Popmusik has a greater tradition.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Since not only go to Twens teenagers or concerts, but also the elderly audience.</seg>
<seg id="32"> They are the trends in the Popmusik that around them, much more because they believe it for a part of the contemporary culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Hvg.hu: what role is to the public in your work?</seg>
<seg id="34"> It is important that those who, where many hear your music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Example Zs.: of course it is good to see a good feeling, that more and more to our concerts.</seg>
<seg id="36"> We have never komponiert but for the market.</seg>
<seg id="37"> The music is not, in order to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The role of the public is generally in the concerts felt and where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment.</seg>
<seg id="39"> Nevertheless, I have noticed one: you make it all very disturbing, you are not more interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Hvg.hu: how far you follow the example of möchtest Yonderboi?</seg>
<seg id="41"> He is on his way and has built up Solist rather his career in the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Example Zs.: we are not really its way, in that we always tried to read any this in our music.</seg>
<seg id="43"> We are rather than Teamplayer, trust in the musical presence of the other and they should develop.</seg>
<seg id="44"> Initially, was, of course, comparisons of our work with the inevitable Yonderboi, several of us have come from his band and taken a different path.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Hvg.hu: in the Charts of mr2 Petőfi Wings of Love 'is' in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="46"> Many have heard only in connection with the name of this number Zagar.</seg>
<seg id="47"> The opening up of was carried out with a somewhat populäreren style in the direction of a wider audience?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Example Zs.: we had no plans to write a Low Countries that goes something like the should then be used as a motor for the Album.</seg>
<seg id="49"> In this song there is more.</seg>
<seg id="50"> It was intended as a final of the Albums with which we wanted to resolve the Klangorgie and the difficult issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Hvg.hu: as you have the six Sängerinnen selected?</seg>
<seg id="52"> Why is it, what was the guiding principle?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> Example Zs.: the basic idea was to make a Gospel-artigen chorus.</seg>
<seg id="54"> The idea was to put together the voices of talented Solisten the domestic Musikszene.</seg>
<seg id="55"> So the sechsköpfige chorus has arisen - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [neo] Juci Németh - we then apäter 'Underground Divas' then.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> Hvg.hu: you have just wolltest song, or it will have to shape the girls?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> Example Zs.: no longer existed in the Instrumentalversion, but as the material for the Album was complete, we thought that this number is still needs ".</seg>
<seg id="58"> The Akkordenabfolge formally requested after a Gesangsstimme.</seg>
<seg id="59"> I have the tune eingesungen still in the same night, later they have learned the girl child.</seg>
<seg id="60"> There was practically everything at first sight and shocking spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="61"> I can remember, I was quite elektrisiert, but it has already taken the 'Divas'.</seg>
<seg id="62"> With my vote the song alone would never become so sharply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Hvg.hu: both on the record, and also to the concert we had the impression, though, the girls in the background.</seg>
<seg id="64"> There is no Solo-part (apart from short by Solo Judy Jay), they do not have their own role, and are not sing louder than the music, their singing is accompanied by the music not only.</seg>
<seg id="65"> They were also on the scene.</seg>
<seg id="66"> Is it the intention?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67"> B.Zs.: that they have stood behind, was a purely technical problems.</seg>
<seg id="68"> However, we wanted to make them deliberately not Solo-roles.</seg>
<seg id="69"> In the number of it is also important that we should be a little egos forget, forget who is how and where, we leave that these particular us wing, emporheben the wings of love.</seg>
<seg id="70"> I would like others too have felt this euphoric state that we have felt, as the story is created.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> Hvg.hu: what was the most expensive song?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> Example Zs.: the musical Schaffensarbeit actually none, there has been more in the Mixen difficult tasks.</seg>
<seg id="73"> For example, 'Dorian Gray's dilemma', in which I was on a Konzertklavier, or 'coat' n '-roll Goes To The Girls', where the Groove did not want to work longer, but in the end everything has brought together, as with a jigsaw puzzle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> Hvg.hu: what is your Lieblingsnummer the new Album?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75"> Example Zs.: the changed with the concerts continuously, and even now, where I have the Album 'losgelasssen'.</seg>
<seg id="76"> At the moment we are 'prophet Is A Fool', 'Escape From the Earth and the number of' Never The Same '.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Budget is by</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, it is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The state budget is adopted.</seg>
<seg id="4"> What is special about this budget?</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is the first budget of the government has drafted, and which was adopted without the support of the opposition by the Koalitionsmehrheit.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The for the current year, has been with the support of the Social Democrats ČSSD (approved), because it had submitted Minister Sobotka (by this party) and the ČSSD it could not afford to reject it.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government nothing drastic happened this time.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Congress approved this traditionally little known, however, highly significant law calmly.</seg>
<seg id="9"> To a certain extent, this is a paradox.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Everything governance begins and ends with the individual chapters of the budget and, whether we like it or not.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="12"> This is for the media a dankbareres issue, and that is why they devote more attention.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A dispute among politicians for the public is much more interesting than sobering figures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Member States have suffered in the last Socialist governments under three weaknesses, which cannot eliminate the budget for the year 2008 at once:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The first is the high percentage of expenditure, which is due by law, but it is not just about pensions, but also about spending, which adopted the 'tacit' coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) in the last year before the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The second is the budgetary deficit as a result of the first Schwachpunkts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The third restriction in the deficits of public finances, in other words the public deficits of local communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id="19"> This budget is public and eingermaßen under control.</seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a veritable time bomb the budget deficit of local communities.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Many mayors gave to open up out of revenue from tax, levies and bank lending further sources for investment, often bond thoughtlessly by their halls in excess indebted.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In recent years, it was to pay this debt by massive selling shares of the energy and other networks which they had received in train the privatisation of state.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Now this source is already dried up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> As far as we keep to official and verifiable facts, we note that:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Our economy for a number of years, as the rest of the world, is going through a period of growth, which prides itself on the ČSSD without constantly.</seg>
<seg id="26"> This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Instead, the state-induced these governments, but more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have spent much more sensible than our Republic.</seg>
<seg id="29"> That is a great shame, which is mainly due to the former governments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, threatened least of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="31"> This is why no nassiven social programmes are needed, which have been blown up in recent years, unfortunately, quite unnecessarily in record time scale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Even if it is a part of the absurd populist expenditure, which were adopted this year, before the elections, to remove, it is clear that if it is not in the near future, to an increase in the retirement age and to a reform of pensions, then ends practically any policy in this country, and, regardless of who is in power, he will remain nothing more than a mere government.</seg>
<seg id="33"> It is only a slight exaggeration if we say that from the politicians, officials, which divide the bulk of the tax revenues mechanically on pensions and social spending.</seg>
<seg id="34"> That is why this year's budget is not a revolution, but it can only put an end to the displacement of normal expenditure by Pflichtausgaben.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The scheduled for 2008 deficit of 70 billion kronor would be superfluous if previous governments would not have been spent in the last ten years, which was only.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If we do not want it really comes to mere administrators from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government which is aware, however, that the state can only spend as much as it is to take on taxes and charges in the situation, calm in the preparation for further reform laws.</seg>
<seg id="37"> This will enable a gradual implementation of a balanced budget.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="3"> So more than USD 100 billion will come through auctions on the Währungsmärkte.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In these auctions banks interest rates to which they are prepared to lend money auction each other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> For example, the US Fed sends USD 40 billion at auction, further 24 they blithely makes for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It is 11.September after the attacks of the first time that the central banks in the individual Member States agree on such a coordinated approach or to alleviate the effects of a crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This step is to remove the greatest difficulties of the economy, in other words, the increasing lack of free verfügbarem capital which give the banks' for its customers Bernard Baumohl wrote in a report by the consultancy firm Economic Outlook Group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> 'The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65% to around 50%,' Baumohl added in his report.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The banks have not already bedienter loans for 60 billion dollars lost, especially in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Further deplored analysts expect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> 'The central banks must have had really afraid of what more can do everything, as decided on this approach, "said the head economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.</seg>
<seg id="12"> 'It is that the situation is really bad,' he said.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, for their customers loans more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="14"> This would reduce the consumption and plunge the American economy in recession, possibly with the impact on the economic growth of the entire world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The central banks have decided, after it has not succeeded in reducing them, the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbankzinssatz, which is used in the Geldverleih between banks.</seg>
<seg id="16"> This means that the banks have constantly fear, to lend money to each other, despite the fact that the central banks in the USA, Canada and the United Kingdom have reduced its interest rates on several occasions during the autumn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> 'The will have the same effect as a further lowering of interest rates,' Greg Salvaggio said of the Tempus programme the Reuters Consulting.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="11"> Klaus reminded us that he is not a Klimatologe, but he was, in his opinion, adequate conditions, to write a book about this.</seg>
<seg id="12"> He was ultimately academics, able to understand and to assess the technical pamphlets, have experience of statistics and was also economist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The main thrust of the book he described the theory that the climate is constantly changing and that it is therefore quite natural that it to global warming, no consensus view among researchers that the consequences of the current changes are not to be too large and seriously and therefore no threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate, superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable expensive.</seg>
<seg id="14"> In addition, he think it as someone who experience with totalitarian Sytemen have to impose unacceptable for other unproven views, to see this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Test Peugeot 207 SW 1 (6) VTi: Voruteile dwindling</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> To tell the truth, I have never been a particular fan of the Peugeot 206.</seg>
<seg id="3"> His Fahreigenschaften were not worth very much, the quality of Gangschaltung, the control and processing could be termed rather below average.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Now, however, his successor, is the Peugeot 207, on the market, and which is much better.</seg>
<seg id="5"> With the name of the Kombi SW is still a bit, and it only remains for me to change my mind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When I had the classic Hatchback tested the 207, I had to complain about me, for example, about the low Kopffreiheit on the Hintersitzen.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These complaints, there is now no longer, because if the Kombi is designed in such a way that not even Zweimetermänner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Further to quickly</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> I shall go through the interior decorating only briefly in order not to repeat myself.</seg>
<seg id="10"> It is a rather successful design, where I have only because of the meagre Mitteltunnels objections.</seg>
<seg id="11"> I would welcome a little more designerische design, where the car is otherwise such an elegant impression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The seats are convenient, and over the times are, where we may be a line no longer exists, or to brief seats.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Also the Seitenhalt has been substantially improved 206.</seg>
<seg id="14"> With regard to the space, we can also feel the compounded here the dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The Kombi, which I mentioned earlier, the lack of Kopffreiheit is also removed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the boot suitcase</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The most important thing in this car is but the Laderaum.</seg>
<seg id="18"> (I must also because of the aufklappbaren Rückfensters) as a very good and describe beladbar platzsparend.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The Hohlräume are equipped with Haltegurten, which constitute a perfect compromise.</seg>
<seg id="20"> They do not disrupt, I consider it apart and also more severe objects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But we have been talking about the Ladevolumen.</seg>
<seg id="22"> It is according to the table in the basic 428 litre, which is a more competition in relation to the average value.</seg>
<seg id="23"> We do not, however, in comparison with the best selling car in the Czech Republic, this category, the Skoda Fabia Combi.</seg>
<seg id="24"> If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we see that Peugeot falls to show signs of 52 litre.</seg>
<seg id="25"> For a Auslandsurlaub or the Einladen Kinderwagens of this value is already critical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But I would like to emphasise the Positiva, I must mention the following the belt Umklappen the very shallow Laderaum or even the very low Ladekante.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> 120 PS in four ranks</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Our Testwagen was equipped with a Vierzylinder-Benzinmotor included 1.6 litres and with an output of 88 KW.</seg>
<seg id="29"> And, quite frankly, a 1 600-Kubik-engine should take the drives a families-Hatchback.</seg>
<seg id="30"> He is quiet, has a low consumption and is well away.</seg>
<seg id="31"> If I compare this with his counterpart in Skoda that works sometimes as would be a vehicle exhaust pipe Lappen, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The price speaks volumes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The price of this car is not exactly volkstümlich.</seg>
<seg id="34"> We must remember, however, that we have tested a well-funded car with a geräumigen Innneren and a very good driving force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> The basic price of cars with the 1400er Benzinmotor of SEK 329900 is.</seg>
<seg id="36"> With our driving force it costs SEK from 410900, which is already quite a lot.</seg>
<seg id="37"> The funding of the premium Testwagens proposes once again with an extra SEK 80000 annually.</seg>
<seg id="38"> We had however Kopfairbags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic Scheibenwischerauslösung, electrical Fensterheber and and...</seg>
<seg id="39"> So the car is costing a total of SEK 531900 simple.</seg>
<seg id="40"> That is a lot, but you calculate the increase of a Fabia and you will arrive in a very similar amount.</seg>
<seg id="41"> Therefore, all that remains is the decision as to which we want to choose brand.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> Three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian President Vladimir Putin is a public television channels in the news in gaining access to the electorate, which has been recorded, whose content is kept secret, however.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He does so in his capacity as lead the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin-party, which was announced a stunning victory.</seg>

<p>

<seg id="7"> We are aware of the price  a true democracy and we hope that honest elections, very clear and open elections without  fraud, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Who will take up  Putin ’ s successor as President?</seg>
<seg id="15"> The Amtszeitung announced yesterday, the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have to make to 23 December time.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Since it was re-elected in 2000 and 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third term of office in consequence.</seg>
<seg id="17"> And now a successor to take place.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The historian Nikolai Kopossov by the State University of St Petersburg goes even further back: civil society has evolved in this country, which has been christianisiert five centuries to Europe, only very slowly, the famous Community spirit which has delayed development of individuality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s Putin was needed to the model of a paternalistic State, which has been accepted by the population, all the more so, because to this new paternalism, followed by a terror, but a degree of economic prosperity, Maria Lipman from the Carnegie Foundation thinks.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Today, the Russians do     voluntarily to the personal responsibility, which they have laid after the collapse of the USSR short-lived.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="28"> This is a phenomenon that affects all sectors of society, including the business world.</seg>
<seg id="29"> And the Verwaltungselite understands it to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian Regionsvorsitzenden), the local lists of United Russia to lead.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="12"> To this end, the bank will alter the premises of those branches who are already in Geschäftszonen, and at the same time bringing them into line with the individual Kundenprofil of the different areas.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The enlargement of the opening hours is linked to a new Raumgestaltung of branches, characterised by a more up-to-date, farbenfroheres design.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> What is the best insurance for me?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The motor vehicle insurance covering a potential disaster caused by drivers, wiederrum contains a high cost, whose level of various factors, etc., depends, among other things, of their age, sex, the drawing up of the driving licence, marital or family status, the nature of the insured cars and its use,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> To have a car is only the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate motor vehicle insurance as the right Fahrzeugmodell.</seg>
<seg id="5"> First of all, there must be a clear that what we are dealing with here.</seg>
<seg id="6"> A mine is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This agreement will be written by means of a contract, which is to establish that society will the agreed Versicherungsprämie and committed in return to submit the appropriate Abfindungssumme when a disaster.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Versicherungsprämie is the cost of insurance, which is made up by several factors, including their age, sex, the drawing up of the driving licence, marital or family status, type of vehicle insured or use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The insurance companies are setting their prices in line with the statistics, so that higher contributions are also due to a higher risk of accidents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> For this reason, must both on 25-year-old children and women less contributions, because statistics show that these groups with a smaller accident rate, thanks to their caution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The same also applies for married people, since these are, according to the statistical values and therefore also convinced that the companies to fewer accidents as Alleinstehende.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The benefits which is attached to the vehicle, affect the frequency and hence also the probability of an accident.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The more the use, the more likely the damage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In the drafting of the insurance premium a whole series of points must be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="15"> For this reason, the driver must study the situation carefully, precisely in order to select the mine that responds to his personal needs.</seg>
<seg id="16"> At this point we statistics now are the most important points which we should learn in the selection of insurance, in order to be able to not only efficient but also a make price-oriented choice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The 25-year-olds to take on the choice of cheap insurance to many obstacles, such as, for example, the poor and the young   driving licence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Even if it would be an ideal cover for the best to conclude a Vollkaskoversicherung, however, there are cheaper alternatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The tentative drivers can select Vollkasko with an exemption, so that the benefits of a Vollkaskoversicherung be covered, but offered at a low price.</seg>
<seg id="20"> This type of treaty means that the consumer has to pay a part of the damage incurred by the amount.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">  The amount will be set before the end of the Treaty and on the basis of the amount of Versicherungsprämie and it is the smaller the  higher to bezahlende sum, Luis Noguera, main exponents of Spain in First declared Europe, a Vermittlungsunternehmen for online insurance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The other option is the enlarged insurance, the insured against external Unfallschäden customers, but not on their own car incurred damage.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Furthermore, it would cover this type of insurance theft, fire and Fahrzeugverlust.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> There is a Council.</seg>
<seg id="25"> If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hands, to reduce the costs of insurance; increase your credit advice by versuchst to drive carefully and to prevent accidents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> A credit advice is a reduction in the basic standard tariff in the insurance company.</seg>
<seg id="27"> On the contrary, a Strafzahlung implies an increase in the tariff will be applied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The amount  credits and total penalty depends on the society and their returns.</seg>
<seg id="29"> If the company has a good year behind it, it can  allow itself to increase the no-payment Noguera, explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> As soon as the 25-year-threshold is exceeded, it is easier to conclude a treaty for the drivers. Reason for this is the fact that the accident rate is falling, with growing driving.</seg>
<seg id="31"> It is therefore best to opt for a Vollkaskoversicherung with excesses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Normally vote  young people can derive any benefit from their experience, both  in the event of an accident and not at the time of the well explained to the Spanish Vorsteher of European company, and adds that the majority of accidents in the second Praxisjahr after the  fear of Anfängers  has been given.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Nevertheless, it is possible for a married customers, which is not to conclude children, better, a Vollkaskoversicherung; of course, it is only the financial situation of the person in question.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> From the insurers are married couples with children as customers, with the lowest accident rate, and correspondingly low for their contributions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> In this case, with an exemption would be Vollkaskoversicherung (with an amount to EUR 300), the best option, in the event that it has received a high credit advice, an enlarged insurance, which is only the third Fahrzeugjahr recommends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> As a whole more relaxed  you go and have a greater purchasing power, the  it allows them to a higher contributions, notes Luis Noguera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> For pensioners, it is with a Vollkaskoversicherung exemption () in order to a sum of EUR 150, or conclude an enlarged insurance, which uses only when a sufficiently high credit advice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> In the end, it is necessary to point out that the mine something very important, not only because it protects the driver Unfallschäden against potential, but also because it entails high costs, making it necessary that a thorough choice is made, which is in line with our personal situation.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Mitt Romey said that he is not worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a Schneemann.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency agreed at the end of the day, a debate on YouTube, include in the ordinary voters questions on video and table to send it to the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Any of the questions which have been raised on Wednesday evening, 28 November, were so ridiculous as the Schneemann, interviewed on global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But the questions, and the answers spiegelten precisely at this time, the state of the republican party, which is on his way in the elections next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It is not known, as well as the producers of CNN, sometimes fail the debate, which identified the potential candidates to zeigenden YouTube Clips.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, in the first half-hour of debate, the longest was devoted to a different issue, immigration in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The issue is one of the most potent issues for Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The CNN asked a group of hybrid voters to operate a Wählscheibe if they heard things liked them: the television station said leaders of the approval of the candidates as strictly on the borders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The ultimate and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leaders, and Romney, has shelved in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire forward.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Tried Giuliani shake the reputation, he had been lax about illegal immigration, when he was mayor of New York.</seg>
<seg id="12"> He was attacking Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts, illegal immigrants to have to work on his house.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The two dealt particularly violent as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates would support a 'amnesty' (the illegal immigrants) would be a regular status and the opportunity to citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Relatively unimportant candidates as Duncan Hunter, a kalifornischer Kongressabgeordneter and Tom Tancredo, a Kongressabgeordneter from Colorado managed to persevere with this issue.</seg>
<seg id="15"> None of the two men has serious opportunities in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have been hacked earlier and harder than other on the Immigrationspauke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At least in the area of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: more stringent limits, intolerance towards illegal migrants.</seg>
<seg id="17"> This issue, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world to help the Republicans to forget or to minimise the differences between the Liberal and Christian Conservatives.</seg>
<seg id="18"> However, the debate has clearly problematic than other issues have been raised.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Mr Giuliani was asked why he Waffenrestriktionen supported in the past.</seg>
<seg id="20"> John MacKein and Romney discussed whether simuliertes drowning should be seen as torture.</seg>
<seg id="21"> One of the honourable Member asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.</seg>
<seg id="22"> This meant that Giuliani was of the opinion that, although the Bible should be privileged book he believed the history of Jonah and the Wal perhaps not literally.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Another honourable Member asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Mike Huckabee - contrary to all expectations, in the first place, in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to its long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty painful, but is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="25"> When he was urged, whether they would be in favour of Jesus, he said was lachte and intelligent Jesus to apply for a political office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Extraordinary the race remains open.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Huckabees rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Pauls recent Spendenerfolgen and his Beifallsstürmen in the debate by Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="28"> These two are high kicked out of nothing, because the two wing of the party do not yet have been unable to agree on one of the better known and more traditional candidates.</seg>
<seg id="29"> In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has the party from the outset and convincing together with winning a message on the size of the USA and a Zwinkern on both arms of the party.</seg>
<seg id="30"> This time, has divided the party and the result is far from clear.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Pain of the Labour Party</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Gordon Brown has discovered a further hole the Hineinfallen; his way out of that remains the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> For British scandals this is not particularly schlüpfrig.</seg>
<seg id="4"> No title seem to be sold, paid any politician Paris Hotelrechnungen, been no wedlock gelutscht 'toes.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But the discovery that a rich businessman donations for the British Labour Government on more than £1.3 million dollars 650.000 () on four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to notify this is something without which would be thousands of disputed territory of Gordon Brown well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As the Prime Minister had two months ago, escaped the demand for an election dämliche way on the intelligence of British offensive by he claimed that opinion polls would not have influenced this decision, there were would hope that it will provide a strong, efficient government.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly insightful Vertretungsvorsitzende the Liberal Democrats, said, Mr Brown, feared by Stalin once to Mr Bean.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The heavy-handed saving Northern rock, a failing bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgement under attack.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Ill thought-out proposals to amend the tax laws have business groups against the government.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The tax system of loss of the personal data of 25 million people showed incredible administrative Pfuschereien.</seg>
<seg id="11"> A trio of generals retired to be launched an uprising in the House of Lords in protest at cuts of military expenditure: ministers of the armed forces, so they claimed, is a Teilzeitjob.</seg>
<seg id="12"> There is now the diverse donations of David Abraham; Mr Watt, Labour's Secretary-General (and their former Erfüllungsleiter) has already resigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> None of this means that Brown irrevocable direction departure is on his way.</seg>
<seg id="14"> However, to govern governments to achieve a turning point, after which they find it impossible.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Neither politicians may people trust, but they are normally their scepticism, if a new force takes the office.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and it needs to be not even a long time, this postponement is over: the public service is beginning to be leaking; while the cabinet ministers unless instructed otherwise; the press is bad news, and the government is defensive and no ambition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In a way, the position of Brown is particularly difficult, because it can in contrast to other political leaders cannot claim to be a new Besen.</seg>
<seg id="18"> So it would be to deny Tony Blair, he was lieutenant.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The problems with Northern rock and the Steuerzuständigkeitsunterlagen, for example, are, together with decisions as Chancellor Brown met the Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And it was not even if directly involved in Missgeschicke Blair, as in the case of long 'money for title' -Untersuchung of political parties - the voters are perhaps the fact that he was it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not quite as bad as it looks</seg>
<seg id="22"> The errors are not so terrible, such as the Conservatives describe it.</seg>
<seg id="23"> As for Mr Bean, no one has ever died, or has been beschwindelt.</seg>
<seg id="24"> And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to supply, which have of course Brown Stalinist tendencies always pledged: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The new political gesture donation is a good example.</seg>
<seg id="26"> The garboeske Abraham, compares its donations, with its non-profit-making gifts, he says, do not want any public recognition for its goodwill.</seg>
<seg id="27"> That may be so, but the decision was not him.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The laws against anonymity for great political contributors are clear and they exist from a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Watt, who says he would know Abraham agreement, but not that it is illegal, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's Hauptfinanzeintreiber, on the odd donations has been told in October will of course have to ask some questions.</seg>
<seg id="30"> But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing that indicates that he knew of this confusion, although most of the payments has been made his appointment in June.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> To date, the Prime Minister has finished half of the work.</seg>
<seg id="32"> He has condemned the violation of the law by his party, but he watered-down this determination by seizing a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the issue - to make this measure, a bishop in retirement and a judge.</seg>
<seg id="33"> In this case, the 'lessons to be learned from' are not very complicated.</seg>
<seg id="34"> If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Apart from that, there are other things must make Mr Brown, as something to find a permanent chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life, which is for the last six months vacant, and to proceed with a radical reform of political parties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> It would require the hard-liners of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and abandon the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party such as Mr Brown.</seg>
<seg id="37"> However, it should be aware of some partisan facts.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls; he has two years to restore voters; and the only way it can achieve a victory, is indisputable rectitude and sound competence.</seg>

<seg id="1"> England faced with decision on the statements made by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> There are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Who is going to propose a No 6 for Kandy England in this weekend Owais or Shah Ravi Bopara?</seg>
<seg id="4"> And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second question is important because David Graveney, Wahlvorsitzende to call at least under this specific title, is here, to decide, in order to help the Cheftrainer Peter Michael Vaughan Moores and the captain, and because the table of high Morries, the English executive director, is gradually filling up with applications for national Wählerämter, if not even for what part-time work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Anyone who has not always the sixth Schlägerposition will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport is without doubt it.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It is never easy to apply exactly what a person at the top of its Berufszweiges, while someone else will never, on the lowest status, sometimes due to a lack of good will.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is not only in the cricket, where the choice is difficult, where decisions are needed, which are always at the end of subjective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Is it the right time to forge ahead Bopara?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Is it fair to Shah if he is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="11"> The same may be needed in a further area if, for example, John Edwards or 'Tubby' Banerjee, both intelligent young managers should be promoted with good qualifications are familiar with the business.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Who can say what the right class, is for a cricketers, unless it is given the opportunity to swim or submerged.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Of course, numbers have a major influence on decisions, but also have opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Within a team a cricketers must catch the eye of the master of the ship at the right time, if he can take a Wicket and a bat regular opportunities must be given in order, if he wants to make as a one-day cricketers impression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> To catch the eyes of the Auswähler is more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="16"> There were many who in the last season better than, for example, as James Anderson, apparently, which will be the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared itself for healthy and as the wind kegelt in the networks.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Anderson, 32 a first-class Wickets with 33 Runs in order to earn a position in this tour.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their high points and hope to even more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Or whether Shah Bopara Asgiriya plays in stage, can only be a Ansichtsfrage.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The election could decide the careers of both men, or perhaps it makes little difference.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in each test and has been successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs but that it was Paul Collingwood, then kämpfend to consolidate, managed to a significant breakthrough Testkricketspieler and, even though he punktete a dual hundred against Australia in Australia, perhaps still underestimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> That will probably Graveney, Vaughan Moores and, after a further discussion in the context of the current Netzsitzung Asgiriya stage in its Conservative instincts and Bauchgefühl Shahs will follow for more experience on Boparas young enthusiasm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> There are arguments for both.</seg>
<seg id="24"> He speaks for Shah funkelnden and valuable 88 test-debut-Innings in Mumbai, 43 first-class Bopara hundreds and only six of the seven years younger with 22 years, and an excellent record against angedrehtes bullets.</seg>
<seg id="25"> But Shah only ten Runs in its two Innings against the West Indies in May on the test in Lord, its Heimatarena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus the immediate rejection of the Auswählern than Vaughan healthy was to withdraw his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum from his fighting, which was still in Mumbai.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> On the contrary, the Alleskönner from Essex has schaufelweise vibrancy.</seg>
<seg id="27"> It is not a Kricketplatz impressed on the sidelines, and its attitude has come to the point, when he recently had a car with an exhibition Vierradantrieb Volkswagen sponsor of England.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was also, of course, be Vodaphone (gesponsort) and its Teamkollegen Alastair Cook, monitoring of this from a distance and enthusiastically to say: "Have you seen? '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Bopara is a much better Feldspieler that he be kegelt Mitteltempo here with some effect on the playing fields, which seems to fit to him and proposes with confidence and skill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> To choose the right man one thing to choose the right moment is another.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Perhaps that is the real art of choice.</seg>
<seg id="32"> I am inclined to give his chance Bopara now, which does not mean that will be left Shah may not be a good idea if he is the person who, as the Teesatz from Sri Lanka suggested, play this weekend.</seg>

<seg id="3"> But both are not convincing.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Either the ideas put too much on Action and Geballer or sentimental but they are.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Since Richard Gere in 'The Hunting Party can not' help.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The good news first: it is true that the war criminals hide Karadzic and Mladic are still in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, now the actors Richard Gere has been found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> We had lost the most beautiful man of the 1980s least, because too many nice-irrelevant roles in Wohlfühlfilmen for women and too many press conferences on the subject of austrieben Buddhism, the desire for inspection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Now all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument, The Hunting Party - if the hunters will 'Gejagten' (Why must always be those actually so long and confusing as driver-collective agreements?) perhaps look at.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It provides a wonderfully augenzwinkernde presentation: basically, be Kriegsreporter Simon Hunt is what has become of Gere if the destiny and the cinematographic sector would not be so gnädig: a man who has its very best for long periods, but as a monument to preserve its decline ruinen the same considerable vestiges of the former charm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> However, despite this Trumpfes The Hunting Party is', together with the German production 'Mörderischer peace', which is also, this week, only the endless series of failed Balkans war-films.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> With 'Mörderischer peace' we can make short process: the film is of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), a Serbin before Kosovar Heckenschützen save what a love promptly in it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although it is a good thing that the Serbs are not only as the root of all evil, the fernsehflache film loses itself too quickly into Geballer and Action.</seg>
<seg id="13"> It is a kind of 'to sound the alarm for Cobra 11' without motorway but with war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> On the other hand, research is to 'The Hunting Party' is an example of why there has never actually been a true good Balkan Kriegsfilm.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The history of three US Kriegsreportern which seek to open the Serbian Oberkriegsverbrecher 'of the fox', with another director and another Drehbuchautor (both in one Richard Shepard) can at a different time perhaps a new 'Apocalypse Now'.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Because the stories are indeed striking: both times are small team in the forest, in order to achieve something which the military cannot and on both occasions there will be a trip to the madness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> One of the reasons for the failure of 'The Hunting Party' is that we do not simply Simon Hunt the cynics can be run with heart when he will be presented to us at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18"> No, it must also Script andichten him a romantic affair, with a later Muslim Bosnierin murdered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Ultimately 'The Hunting Party' then sold down the river, catch if the reporters within the last five minutes Zeitrafferverfahren succeed in what NATO, CIA Kopfgeldjäger and all the world have not achieved in five years: the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians for fair revenge.</seg>
<seg id="20"> This is so bad that we want to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The film has a very human concerns.</seg>
<seg id="22"> It intends to denounce that Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic still rumlaufen freely, and he suspected of the Americans and the French (here they are meant to be an exception and sometimes agreed) to promote the persecution on the grounds of secret political agreements not too.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But the good and evil Gemeinte are sometimes so similar to that is a famous Brecht-poem.</seg>
<seg id="24"> It says on the Holzmaske an Asian Dämons on the Arbeitstisch the poet: 'Mitfühlend I see the geschwollenen Stirnadern, andeutend: how demanding it is to be a bad'.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Films as' The Hunting Party 'have to be precisely for such Schwellköpfe which indicate but, as it is demanding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The problem is not limited to the Genre of Balkankriegsfilms.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Recently, that all Iraq Hollywoods films were great Flops has been in this newspaper report.</seg>
<seg id="28"> We can add: there has never been a good South Africa film.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Almost always applies: if a Star driving around on the trouble spots or minefields the world, then something is out, such as "Rangoon dismisses' with Patricia Arquette 'Jenseits all frontiers with Angelina Jolie or' blood diamonds' with Leonardo DiCaprio.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It may be that all the conflicts are simply time to close.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> It has taken after decades before Hollywood could go with 'Schindlers list' a good film on the Holocaust.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Some film is mature may still be in force - the now as a classic Vietnam works' The Deer Hunter ',' Apocalypse Now 'or' full Metal jacket 'celebrated at the time are masterpieces as unanimously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> But perhaps we know today, where everyone is mass murder in real time on two screens at home also quite simply too much about the conflicts in the world.</seg>
<seg id="34"> And this is undermining the Drehbuchschreibern the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs to tell good stories.</seg>
<seg id="35"> 'continued existence, or otherwise, of' or 'The great dictator' of course have become so much is because Lubitsch and still Chaplin did not know how serious the Nazi regime was genuinely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Perhaps we should not want to be good, if we want to make good films.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Perhaps we must have the sarcasm Künstlerblick distancing of Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk.</seg>

<seg id="1"> These are not Warhols cases</seg>
</hl
<p>
<seg id="2"> Anyone who combines the concepts of Sweden and Holzkiste, thinks of Ikea, but not in Andy Warhol.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Or it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Currently, in Sweden fabrizierte Holzkisten cast dark shadow over Warhols Werkverzeichnis.</seg>
<seg id="5"> A large proportion of the vierundneunzig Brillo boxes listed in the 'type Stockholm' are counterfeiting.</seg>
<seg id="6"> After the Swedish newspaper 'Expressen' a few months ago, doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhols has fuelled Brillo boxes of 1968, internal investigations in Moderna Museet in Stockholm now to a sobering result: the six 'Brillo-boxes' which the former Museumsdirektor Pontus Hultén the Moderna Museet 1995 Hungary Constantine, copies are - and I think the majority of around one hundred further Brillo boxes' the type of Stockholm ', which are on the international art market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The background is verschachtelt, a confusing string of artistic and kuratorischer productions.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In 1964 Warhol created in New York, his first 'Brillo-boxes' bemalte Holzkisten based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard Seifenpulvers' Brillo '.</seg>
<seg id="9"> His work in an exhibition Moderna Museet from 1968 was - Warhols agreement, with hundreds of Brillo-from cardboard boxes: these reasons) (were not Warhol, but they have been impossible to directly from the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik.</seg>
<seg id="10"> It was not a question of works of art, but whose models, a mere exhibits.</seg>
<seg id="11"> At the same time, probably in 1968 Warhol has given permission to produce a few Brillo-Holzkisten in Sweden, which have not been issued in Moderna Museet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> All witness to speak now about fifteen boxes, which are then as authorised original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-boxes with the term 'type Stockholm' right in the art and Auktionsgeschichte.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Some of them have achieved at auctions more than 100 000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The problem is that the legendary Museumsdirektor Pontus Hultén wrongly claimed later, be it produces around one hundred Holzkisten 1968 in Sweden and has been issued, the Warhol then have to leave him.</seg>
<seg id="15"> In fact, 105 cases have been Hulténs produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="16"> At this time it was three years Warhol dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Lars Byström, Chefkonservator on Moderna Museet, in addition to the six museum own Brillo-boxes three examined from the Swedish privately, two of which have been carried out in 1968 in Stockholm: their Pressspanplatten grundiert abgeschmirgelt were first and then, white Ölfarbe was entrusted with a Pinsel.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The structure of the copies from 1990 against reveals that the colour was entrusted with a Malerrolle without Grundierung directly to the Pressspanplatte - it is not a question of oil, but Acrylfarbe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> 'This cases have not been authorised by the artists and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-boxes ", the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, said:' If the 'Andy Warhol type Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will define the six cases in its collection as copies / Ausstellungsmaterial. '</seg>
<seg id="20"> In July, the Authentication Board has announced to investigate the serious accusations', in terms of the Seifenpulver-boxes.</seg>
<seg id="21"> But since then, it remains unerbittliches in silence.</seg>
