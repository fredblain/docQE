What kind of insurance is to find the best?  
The KFZ-Versicherung, the a caused by the driver the world's forth covers, is a very high costs, which level wiederrum of various factors on, one of age, sex, time the drawing up of Führerscheins, Familienstand, some kind of to versichernden cars and its use, and so on.  
To have A car is just the beginning.  
In fact it is even more difficult the good KFZ-Versicherung to find a the right Fahrzeugmodell.  
First of all is a clear be, what we have to do it here.  
A Autoversicherung is an agreement between a Versicherungsgesellschaft in addition to a number.  
This agreement will be written by a Versicherungsvertrags recorded, the states, that the civil society the agreed Versicherungsprämie will and in return the commitment is, in a forth the this matter Abfindungssumme present.  
The Versicherungsprämie is the price of insurance, the is by several factors made up, among other things. age, sex, time the drawing up of Führerscheins, Familienstand, some kind of to versichernden vehicle or its use.  
The insurance companies set their own prices in the statistics say, and in a higher risk also higher contributions earlier will.  
For this reason we should have both on 25-Jährige and women make more contributions, as statistics show, however, that these groups with their caution a lower Unfallquote to.  
The same applies also to married people, because this according to the statistical values and therefore also to that of the companies, to less accidents tend as Alleinstehende.  
The We, the the vehicle attached will, an adverse effect the frequency of Fahrens and it also the likelihood of an accident.  
The more the use, the more likely the damage.  
With regard to the establishment of the premium must the insurance a number of points into account.  
For this reason must also the drivers the situation very carefully study, in order exactly what the Autoversicherung environment, the his personal needs best response.  
We listen to this point now the most important points to, which we should take into account in terms of selecting a insurance, in order not only a strong, but also a preisorientierte election taken to can.  
The in 11% taken in the election of a cheap insurance in a number of obstacles, as for example the small Fahrpraxis and the junge specific.  
Even if it for a perfect insurance the best would be, a Vollkaskoversicherung a successful conclusion, is it still cheaper alternatives.  
The cautious drivers can the one hand Vollkasko with Selbstbeteiligung choose, and the services a Vollkaskoversicherung is covered, but at a low price offer will.  
This type of Treaty is, however, that the consumer must pay some of the amount created by the damage himself.  
Der amount will in a successful conclusion of the Treaty and on the total amount of Versicherungsprämie established. This is higher the lower the to bezahlende Summe, said Luis Noguera, Council Spain in First Europe, a Vermittlungsunternehmen for Online-Versicherungen.  
Another option is the more extensive insurance, the the customers against external Unfallschäden assured us of this, but not against the on their own car has been created damage.  
In addition would this type of insurance theft, fire and Fahrzeugverlust cover.  
The a Council.  
If you are old in 25 years, is it in your hand, the insurance costs to a very low level, it increased to accept Gutschrift, by you versuchst, careful to travel and accidents can be prevented.  
A Gutschrift is a reduction of five in the this matter Versicherungsgesellschaft.  
On the contrary to is a Strafzahlung a question tariff increase.  
Die how high credits and Strafzahlungen are of the society and its return from.  
If the company a ertragsreiches year behind it has, however, can it is possible, the Bonus-Zahlungen to erhöhen, set out Noguera.  
Once the 25-Jahre-Marke goes beyond that is, is it for the drivers simple a Treaty completed. The reason for this is the fact, however, that with increased Fahrpraxis the Unfallquote falling.  
This is it the sinnvollsten, are in favour of a Vollkaskoversicherung with Selbstbeteiligung to decide.  
Normalerweise can the young people will not benefit from their previous experience from, both in the event of an accident as well as the timing of Fahrens nicht, set out the Spanish Vorsteher the European company, and adds a further point, that the majority of the accidents is in second Praxisjahr happen, after the Angst the Anfängers question was.  
In spite of this is it in a married customers, who has no children, ratsamer, a Vollkaskoversicherung complete, of course be, if it the financial situation the appropriate person also allows.  
The the companies as well as couples with children and the customers with the lowest Unfallquote, and therefore low are also their contributions from.  
In this case would be a Vollkaskoversicherung with Selbstbeteiligung, in a amount to the 300 available draft it the best option. In case that we a high Gutschrift they has, , is a more extensive insurance, the only the third Fahrzeugjahr place.  
Sie driving as a whole entspannter and have a greater purchasing power, the it them the floor, a greater contribution anzusetzen, is Luis Noguera said.  
For retired people is it is to, a Vollkaskoversicherung with Selbstbeteiligung, in a amount to the 150 euro draft it, or a wider insurance a successful conclusion, the only in a sufficiently high Gutschrift place.  
In must be quite clear, however, that the Autoversicherung something very important is, not only, because it the drivers against possible Unfallschäden protect, and, because it high costs is, which it must, however, that a fundamental choice made will, which is our personal situation.
