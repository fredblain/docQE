In many areas will to Desinfektionsmitteln saved 
Heuer have been more than a thousand infections recorded in hospitals, which were caused to the improper use of antibiotics.  
The health conditions of the hospitals, the Überbelegung of the beds, the congestion of the staff, all factors, the the Eindämmen the infections not just good are, as the senior doctor of National Epidemiologiezentrums.  
In many areas will also in the Desinfektionsmitteln saved.  
In the Traumatologie-Abteilung the János hospital was so long ago a MRSA-Infektion diagnosed.  
The against antibiotics resistente Bakterium was found in a male patient, who has been provided in hospital in a serious accident.  
The patient has been isolated.  
The beginning of the year, it is already a similar infection.  
The injured a serious Autounfalls was released from the hospital, less than later had the man but not with a MRSA-Infektion return. A major operation, since for the Bakteriums, the is still in the body of the patients is, however, have not implemented.  
So far 10 December of the year were from hospitals 1094 by multiresistente agent has infections to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance system reported, however, as the senior doctor the National Epidemiologiezentrums, Karolina Böröcz.  
For many people, by multiresistente agent has infections were registered in the hospitals in other words with security, the unreported, but be higher.  
About two thirds of the infections, 683 cases draft it were the MRSA, the against Methicillin-Oxacillin resistenten Staphylococcus aureus caused.  
The Staphylococcus aureus, SA draft it Bakterium is about a third of the people in their hearts, but not that it cause a disease would.  
SA-bedingte infections, as more or less Halsentzündung, Mandelentzündung, Entzündungen of the skin or wounds draft it respond more often well to antibiotics, they are well curable.  
Will the money but not too high dosiert or unsachgemäß applied, may arise from the well respondierenden away Antibiotika-resistente, which is under appropriate conditions in the hospitals quickly spread.  
In particular in patients with geschwächtem, or the long term a bad thing funktionierendem Immunsystem, and in older, or patients with small Körpergewicht can this away serious infections, example Wundinfektion or Blutvergiftung, other words Sepsis, cause.  
The medical head of János hospital, is the MRSA-Infektion nothing special, however, such incidents are the Krankehausalltag.  
We should the policy no longer with the disease between, manhte Tibor Nyulasi, MRSA is it only there not, where they will did not find.  
Resistent against antibiotics 
Of Such patients are isolated, however, the Pflegepersonal is Gummihandschuhe and Masken in the supply, and we have on the for the deal with necessary antibiotics which, it Tibor Nyulasi.  
In the EU's Einlieferung hospital will the patients are to MRSA under investigation, a infection can still do not always avoided.  
Probenentnahmen to rarely 
The majority of by MRSA caused infections in hospitals would be avoided, but that the currently prevailing conditions and circumstances good for the control of the creation or the spread of multiresistenten Erregers, however, say Karolina Böröcz.  
After the infection mainly in hospitals and Altersheimen do, however, should the Spitäler the eingelieferten patients into consideration and MRSA-infizierte immediately isolate.  
In the Hungarian hospitals will the microbiological authorisation but not too many into practice.  
Last, but not least because it from the state Krankenkasse no support for this investigation is.  
The most cases would therefore be brought out into the light of day, if the patients have a bemerkbare MRSA-Infektion has, so the medical head of Epidemiologiezentrums.  
The of the European Union is it strict recommendations on this matter use of antibiotics in the medicine, it is and in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and Krankheitsbilder.  
Antibiotika-Therapien should must be, that is, however, microbiological studies are necessary, it is no Resistenz against the resources which can, but will this directive of hospitals also not always complied with.  
In the ambulanten, or are in the care and patients are microbiological handling Probenentnahmen even more rare, however, it Karolina Böröcz.  
Gespart will with regard the Desinfektionsmitteln 
Scientific evidence show, however, that MRSA of a patients on the other on most of Pflegepersonal it will.  
For that reason is the Händewaschen, or the role of Handschuhen and Masken a great importance to, but is it also in this area a great deal shortcomings in the hospitals.  
MRSA is by Tröpfcheninfektion or a daily basis and, in the future hospitals is but not always the possibility, to isolate the infected patients.  
The room is even often overloaded, the beds only each other gereiht, although it should be a gap of at least 1.5 meters between them from epidemiological perspective.  
As Karolina Böröcz further points out, is it unfortunately in the financial much less good and hospitals even before, that in Desinfektionsmitteln saved will, it is only a few Pfleger, many patients, all factors, the the source of infection is they.  
The infections are there are far less often, or can be the further spread of Erregers Against Racism will, where these measures will be adhered to, as Karolina Böröcz.  
Programme against MRSA 
MRSA-Infektionen in the top at all. the health insurance enormous costs, it will therefore be opposed.  
In the United Kingdom for example was the prevention of MRSA, and their control held in programme.  
The first signs is the programme a success, as published data show, is the trend the MRSA-Infektionen in the United Kingdom down.  
The European centre for Krankheitsprävention The ECDC draft it has the prevent the creation of multiresistenten flies, including also MRSA draft it, as well as the prevention of infection in hospitals to a its priorities said.
