Global climate change damage allegedly developing countries most.  
President Vaclav Klaus said is once again on the global warming issue.  
The criticism he is now on the to end other international Conference the United Nations on climate change in Bali.  
In Vienna, where he his book ' A warning, a green world out which, however, was it in, that the debate the Ökologen quite incredible that.  
Klaus, is not only the structure of the Conference unacceptable, the a strange mixture of government and this kind of Nicht-Regierungsorganisationen bilde, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric, which they begleite, and the real world.  
' The debate there is unstrukturiert, it is a Wortfeuerwerk, however, the only alternative is for a real solution gegenwärtiger problems, which said Klaus.  
The Czech President has said in the idea his book, that this issue for it very important is, and that it is for this reason we engagiere.  
He made also his satisfaction on from, however, that his book in German translation appear, because ' I often to Karikaturen my views meeting. which 
We could go its own view is unverzerrt read.  
Klaus reminded us to, that it is not Klimatologe is, but he have his opinion sufficient conditions, in order to write a book of this kind.

I also think it it as they, however, the experience with totalitarian Sytemen have, for unacceptable, other unbewiesene views on, he see this as a dangerous restriction of the freedom to.  
In the issues of House said it many times, it is not against ' a sound environment, but against militant Öko-Aktivisten, the not into consideration in the relationship between effort and reward. which 
Over the same issue had Klaus in Vienna have two months ago in Hayek-Institut talking about.
