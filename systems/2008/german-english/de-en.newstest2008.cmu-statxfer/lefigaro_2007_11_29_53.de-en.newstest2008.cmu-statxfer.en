Spektakuläre repair in relation to the following the Raumstation 
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades of the crew the International Raumstation, ISS draft it will be more than seven hours in space needed have, to the spectacular repair a defekten Sonnenkollektors carried out, the for the continuation of the scientific work on the station essential is.  
A gewagter withdrawal, the because of the long term, the removal of bewohnbaren modules, the speed, with which it has been organised, and the of the astronauts gebastelten tools, in order to implement the repair, several records reached has.  
The problem was on Wednesday to, and the astronauts the module Harmony of the Raumfähre Discovery pulled had, a very important zylinderförmiges part, as long as it is soon the European and Japanese scientific laboratory to admit is.  
In this module is a kind Landungsbrücke for the Modul-Labore.  
But we must provide them with electricity the way.  
The second task of the crew was it other words, a 17.5 tons heavy module to electricity on Sonnenkollektoren, the is already on the ISS was, implement, in order to bring it in its final position.  
After it had moved it, was not only the crew on board the restructuring the Sonnenkollektoren the Moduls, which Spannweite 76 meters is.  
And in this respect through it, that a the Kollektoren, which is as Akkordeone auffalten on, by a eingeklemmtes cable on a length of more or less a metres damage was 
The restructuring was stopped, in order the Kollektor not even more to damage.  
The astronauts, which was in favour of a Kontrollgang the Raumfähre Discovery get out and then another Sonnenkollektor, which Rotationssystem wrong was, repair should, saw is no alternative, is the damaged Kollektor to be paid to it.  
And Scott Parazynski was chosen, at the end of the day of 30 metres long ferngesteuerten Arms the Raumfähre, the to the the station should been was, was to cross, in order to implement the repair.  
It is one of the best Spacewalker (Wetraumgänger draft it the NASA.  
Groß, resilient, very well, he has a well developed Oberkörper and for a long arms.  
The 46-jähirige gelernte a doctor was other words chosen, however, the verletzten Sonnenkollektor to operieren.  
Just when it the damage exactly what group was, durchtrennte he the defective cable and befestigte a way had to the damaged House.  
It was of a second Spacewalker, the in the near the Schleuse was, however, supported, and, of Euro 11, of the other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, Kommandantin of the occupation.  
This means, however, that he used, a Mini-Hockeyschläger, with Isolator umwickelt, in order to the Sonnenkollektoren, the several hundred Volt produce, a electrical blow to prevent, had the astronauts on board the station followed and gebastelt.  
As the action an end has been, took Scott Parazynski, to the Kollektor full aufgefaltet was, before it its own tools abzählte and in the station back his.  
Yesterday afternoon It the astronauts half a day reduce tensions, before today seven astronauts to the Raumfähre Discovery back were, in order likely Wednesday the from to world to take a stand against.
