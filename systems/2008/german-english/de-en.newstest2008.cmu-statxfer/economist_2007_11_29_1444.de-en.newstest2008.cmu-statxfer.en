Everything is still open 
Mitt Romey has said, it is it not a President worthy, of a Schneemann are being asked to it.  
But said is the republican candidate for the Presidency is prepared, however, is a debate on YouTube. , in which ordinary voters issues on video to admit and submit, to send the candidate countries about it.  
No the issues, the on Mittwochabend, the 28 November, however, raised were, were so ridiculous as the Schneemann, the Democrats on the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party asked.  
But the questions, and the answers, spiegelten this time is the state of the republican party which, the in the elections in the next year aufbricht.  
It is not known, however, exactly how the producers of CNN, the the debate mitunterstützten, the the angehenden candidates to trend YouTube Clips auswählten.  
But in the first half hour of the debate, the longest the a different issue that was, was immigration in the heart.  
The issue is one thing the schlagkräftigsten issues for republicans.  
The CNN asked a group of tied voters a Wählscheibe to meet, if they said things, however, the they admired, The Fernsehanstalt said Spitzen the agreement as the candidate countries strictly on the borders said.  
The harshest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national champion, and Romney, the are in the most critical surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire to lead geschoben has.  
Giuliani tried to the reputation abzuschütteln, it is industry-friendly on illegal immigration has been, when he was Mayor of New York.  
It attackierte Romney in which he accused the former Governor of Massachusetts, illegal immigrants to work in the House an end to this situation.  
The two got a particularly strong point as Mr Gallagher asked, whether a the candidates a ' amnesty ', the illegal immigrants a legal status and the way in which citizenship there would draft it support would.  
Unbedeutendere candidate countries as Duncan Hunter, a kalifornischer Kongressabgeordneter, and Tom Tancredo, a Kongressabgeordneter from the Colorado regions, was it in the subject nachzuhaken.  
No one the two men has serious chance in the nomination, but they remain in the race, perhaps because they used and more than others to the Immigrationspauke gehauen have.  
At least in the field of immigration share the candidates in more or less the same views, up borders, intolerance to illegal immigrants.  
This issue, however, together with concerns about toxic toys from China or other concerns of the rest of the world, help the republicans to forget the differences between Liberal and Christian Conservatives and to emigrate.  
But the debate was clearly a major problem and other issues raised have been.  
Mr President Giuliani was asked, and it Waffenrestriktionen in the past supported have.  
John McCain and Romney under discussion about, whether simuliertes drowning will be seen as a torture should.  
One of the questions asked, whether the candidate countries believe every word of the Bible.  
This led to, that Giuliani the position was, however, that although the Bible is his particular book, he the history of Jonah and the Wal perhaps not quite believe.  
The other questions asked, whether Jesus would support the death penalty.  
Mike Huckabee, now against all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa with his existing for a long time Christian Konservativismus, said, however, that the death painful, but necessary is.  
As he has been urged to it, whether Jesus they support would, lachte it on and said Jesus was to intelligence in order to apply it for a political office.  
The race remains very much open.  
Huckabees It in Iowa is the same time with Ron Pauls recent Spendenerfolgen and his Beifallsstürmen in the debate of Wednesday.  
The two are from the That hochgeschossen, because the two side of the party is so far yet to a the bekannteren and advocates candidates a number could.  
In year 1980 and 2000 has a candidate country the party from the outset and man united with a winning message on the size America's and a Zwinkern to two over the party.  
This time is divided the party and the result is a long chalk not clear.
