England faced with the decision taken on the comments of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara 
The two dilemmas, each one it almost as difficult as the other.  
Who is a number 6 for the United Kingdom in Kandy in this weekend, , Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?  
In addition, no less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?  
The second question is important, because David Graveney, the Wahlvorsitzende, to call at least in this particular title, this is, in order the Cheftrainer Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan in to help them to decide, and that is the table of High Morries, the English executive director, starting with candidates for the Member States ' Wählerämter really, if not even for the in Teilzeit.  
Who also are not the sixth Schlägerposition about it, will be unfortunate, but the life is often unfair and the sport is it no doubt.  
It is never easy, clearly marked, what a human being made possible the top its Berufszweiges to achieve, in any case not on the lowest level succeeding, some cases from lack of success rather than ability.  
It is not only in Kricket, where the selection difficult is, where decisions necessary is concerned, which are always subjective at the end.  
Is it the right time for Bopara full standing?  
Is it fair to Shah if it is it?  
The same can probably also in a further area this will, however, whether for example John Edwards or ' Tubby which Banerjee, both intelligent young leaders with good qualifications, the the business well know, promoted will should.  
Who can say, what the right class to a Kricketspieler is concerned, it is the fact, it is an opportunity, to be prepared and remain.  
Of course have figures a major influence on decisions, but we have this also.  
The a team must a Kricketspieler the eye of the captain for the right time are, if it a Wicket take can and a thugs must regular opportunities on the order received, if it as a eintägiger Kricketspieler impression to us would like to see.  
The eyes of Auswähler to catch is more complicated.  
It was a great deal, which in the last season more effectively than, for example, and James Anderson were, the play in the first test apparently will, even if Stephen Harmison themselves for healthy said and as the winds in the networks kegelt.  
Anderson, 32 first-class Wickets with the 33 Runs, in order to earn a position in this Tour.  
Chris Tremlett, only 29 with the same modest average, but they have had their Glanzpunkte and hope to more than that.  
Whether or not Shah or Bopara in Asgiriya stage is, can only a Ansichtsfrage be.  
The election could the Karrieren decide both men, and it is perhaps but very little difference.  
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty in every test and has been successful in first, with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs, it was, however, Paul Collingwood, was still kämpfend in order to consolidate itself, the the breakthrough to a very serious Testkricketspieler concerned and the, although it a double hundred against Australia in Australia punktete, perhaps still underestimated will.  
It is, however, that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, to a further discussion as the today's Netzsitzung in Asgiriya stage their Conservative instincts and Bauchgefühl for Shahs greater experience on Boparas young enthusiasm the same will.  
There are arguments for both.  
The Shah is the country's funkelnden and very important 88 Test-Debüt-Innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, the seven years with 22 years younger is, and a good record against angedrehtes bullets.  
But Shah was only 10 Runs in his two Innings in May against West Indies in the test at Lord, his or her Heimatarena as a players from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the Auswählern and Vaughan healthy was, in order its position for the next game back, think the momentum from his Would taken to have, the are still in Bombay has been.  
On the other hand to has the Alleskönner from Essex schaufelweise Lebensfreude.  
It is of no benefit to a Kricketplatz impressed and its position outside of it was on the point been made, and he recently a vehicle with Vierradantrieb in a issue for England sponsor Volkswagen in rapid succession, . 
It erlitt minor injuries and I believe a shock, but the first, what he did, however, was be Vodafone, of course also gesponsort draft it so and his Teamkollegen Alastair Cook to, the this from afar, had, and with enthusiasm to say: ' Have you the seen? '.  
Bopara is a much better Feldspieler, however, he kegelt be Mitteltempo with some effect here on the Spielfeldern, which seems to fit to it and forward with confidence and skill.  
To choose The right man is one thing, however, to choose the right time another.  
Perhaps this is the real art of the choice.  
I tend to Bopara now its opportunity to give, what does not mean, however, that Shah would not but well off will, if, as the Teesatz from Ceylon People, he who is, the here this weekend play will.
