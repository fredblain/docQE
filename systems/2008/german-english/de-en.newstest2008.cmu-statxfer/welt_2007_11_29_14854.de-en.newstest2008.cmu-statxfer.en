Richard Gere is quite simply not cynical enough 
The ' The Hunting Party \" and \" Mörderischer peace which deal with is once again two films with the Balkans.  
But they do not.  
The the ideas put to a great deal to Action and Geballer or but they are to rührselig.  
In fact can also Richard Gere in ' The Hunting Party which no avail.  
The good news first: Of course hide is the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still in the mountains of the Balkans, but it there, in that base the Bosnien-Krieges, is now the Schauspieler Richard Gere has been reflected.  
We have had the best man the Achtzigerjahre most recently from the eyes lost, because too many nett-belanglose roles in Wohlfühlfilmen for women and far too many press conferences on Buddhism a the desire to come austrieben.  
This is Richard Gere a the most important point, is ' The Hunting Party, If the hunters to Gejagten will ', Why we should have title this is always so long and wirr be as Lokführer-Tarifverträge? draft it may after all see.  
It is a great augenzwinkernde we, In fact a great deal is be Kriegsreporter Simon Hunt the, which from Gere would be able to, if the fate and the Filmbranche less gnädig would be: A man, the its very best these days long behind is has, the but even as ruinengleiches Denkmal his decline still a great deal left the former Charmes, has.  
But despite this Trumpfes, ' The Hunting Party \" put together with the German production \" Mörderischer peace out, the also in the course of this week starting, only the endless number gescheiterter Balkankriegs-Filme continue.  
The ' Mörderischer peace which can be very brief process to make, The film is of two German soldiers in Kosovo, Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt draft it, the a Serbin in Kosovo Heckenschützen save, which is The first promptly even further in they love.  
Although it a good idea is, that here again not the Serbs and only at all evil presented will, losing to the fernsehflache film too quickly in Geballer and Action.  
It is a kind of alarm for Cobra 11 which no longer motorway but for with war.  
However, is to ' The Hunting Party which is an action, however, why it is never a right good Balkan-Kriegsfilm there has.  
The history of three US-Kriegsreportern, which is analysis, however, in order the Serbian Oberkriegsverbrecher ' the Fuchs \" identify, had been with a other orchestrator and another Drehbuchautor, both in Personalunion Richard Shepard draft it to another time maybe a new \" Apocalypse Now which will be able to.  
After all the stories like it is diverse, Both times are small teams in the forest, in order something to people, and the military no longer can and both times will be a visit in the situation.  
One of the reasons for the failure of ' The Hunting Party which is, however, that we Simon Hunt no the purpose with cynic heart be is, as the he us at the beginning which will.  
No, the Script must him which not only a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin andichten.  
Endgültig is ' The Hunting Party which will be that the go off, if the reporters in the last five minutes in Zeitrafferverfahren the can, which NATO, CIA and all Kopfgeldjäger the world in five years ' time failed have: The war are and the Muslim Bosnians to fair revenge to it.  
This is so bad, that we the International Criminal Court in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik Justice would.  
It has of the film a very human issue.  
It would condemn, however, that Karadzic and Mladic still free rumlaufen, and he suspected the Americans and the French people, this should it is for all be in agreement, the persecution by secret political agreements not too hard to do.  
But the good Gemeinte and the evil are not only sometimes it the same lines, that a a berühmtes Brecht-Gedicht in the sense is.  
In other words it on the Holzmaske a Asian Dämons to the Arbeitstisch of the poet: ' Mitfühlend see I the geschwollenen Stirnadern, andeutend, just how tough it is, however, have to be out.  
Films as ' The Hunting Party which have exactly what this Schwellköpfe, the but suggesting, how tough it is, a good thing to.  
The problem is not to the Genre of Balkankriegsfilms quite limited.  
The other day is in this newspaper related been, that all Irak-Filme Hollywoods major Flops were.  
No one can say that It has also never a good Südafrika-Film taken place.  
Almost always is: When is a Star on the conflicts or Minenfeldern of the world herumtreibt, it is such a thing in out as ' Rangoon \" with Patricia Arquette, \" above all borders \" with Angelina Jolie or \" blood diamonds out with Leonardo DiCaprio.  
It is all the conflicts in time simply have to close.  
It had at least several decades before, before Hollywood with ' Schindlers list which a good film on the holocaust see was.  
Some film will no doubt still be, the now current as a classic Vietnam-Werke ' The Deer Hunter \", \" Apocalypse Now \" and \" Full Metal jacket which are time is not everyone agrees as masterpieces celebrated been.  
But will I know we today, where everyone mass murder in real time to just two Bildschirme at is, also just too much on the conflicts of the world.  
In addition the raubt the Drehbuchschreibern the Bedenkenlosigkeit, which it needs, in order to tell good stories.  
' His and non-democracy \" or \" The great dictator which are after all, and therefore less has become, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still do not know, however, how bad the Naziregime really was.  
It must be not be good would like, if you will make good films.  
It must be the ironically distant Künstlerblick the Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk have said.  
As the to parallels between his historical novel ' Lemprières dictionary \" and the Balkans are being asked was, said it: ' It is only to, that are some things never change.  
Cities are always very dangerous be, however, people are killed in horrifying way always be and always will war in Yugoslavia is. \"
