Six deterrent things, in order colleagues to angry 
E-mails, which we forget that abzuschicken, Sprachnachrichten, which we never received any, harmless lies, the us no longer auffallen, you put forward ' paint out in the day at work.  
The question is working, whether it is in this small receiving used, or is it is more effectively the challenge and an attempt this playing, for other annoying situation account to vermweiden.  
Tipps.  
' Sorry, I have forgotten you line, however, that some of the Marketing-Abteilung called has out, said a Mr.  
The fact we by a meeting failed has?  
This regrets we it and tried it once again organise, by it may in the Marketing-Abteilung phone and reumütig suggests, we should have been ignored, the news line, the is the less traditional method draft it.  
In most cases is the matter adopting with an excuse.  
Before we are in hard excuses attacks, should we think about it, what we his colleagues really tough times are can and try, to avoid these situations aware.  
The ausgeliehen, which is not a themselves heard?  
It is very little Nervigeres, rather than if we after a document, Bürozubehör, or the telephone Mr President, but it is not here.  
Yesterday was the Heftgerät still on the desk, this morning is it no longer?  
Or will the lost an Kugelschreiber more or less on the desk of a colleagues discovered?  
I ask my view it is not of the Members ausleihen, because they are used anger, if they say, however, that something weggekommen is.  
In other words, not Kuverts and Post-its from the office in the funds are, because it could a even taken, none left, as long man's but urgent needs.  
Getratsche on the life of the Members?  
There are no effective means, a Tratsch, the has already been set in the world was, stop.  
Who with who, which made?  
Where and why?  
We should the information, or suspicion draft it on the life of the Members that, if possible, not everyone in the heart '.  
And as long are they are open and we be innerstes secret displays, should we of the confidence not use.  
Most we keep quiet as a grave, rather than the is not present conflict, even if others on the problems of the Member also know where they stand.  
Without good reason ill reported.  
If we in office phone, in order is under appeal to quälende shape ill to speak, because we are very uncomfortable an awkward position, or is simply however Mr President, should we will be clear about one thing: The own work, essential Erledigungen, projects with firm deadlines must now the House rather than a even do.  
The Members is not only at play.  
If we have the previous know, however, that we it the next day not to office set up will, or that something dazwischenkommen could, and we remain at home must, should be it in speak, it not the Members, still the head will be faced unexpectedly with the absence.  
Gesumme, however, Gekicher, Telefonieren 
It is just strengthened in its work, however, is but a the be Gekicher the, off?  
Ungewollt a telephone mitgehört, however, that we better not would listen to?  
It should be the Members do not with money, Singen, be talks, which we on their heads and is draft it, Getrampel, dauerndem Schimpfen or Nörgeln nerven.  
All this is very disturbing be, even if they do not just in a task of writing, are planning, organise, monitor are.  
Are all the other bad.  
Is a project not time ready, has be an important one letter or important Nachrichte forget abzuschicken, should be the responsibility of its own people not seek in others.  
The possibility should we are not in the chaos in the Bureau or the what Mr ausreden.  
The best way we admits to his mistakes a, and apologies are, however, if others also affected were.  
The issue, as we the mistake again the lost ground, or the Versäumte up can, is simply too good.  
In office, a feeling as at home?  
Trainingshose and Schlapfen: Bequem for at home, has but in the office not lost.  
Not even then should we are so lightly dress, if it of the work permit is would be.  
Bloß not to slipshod will, we should both his colleagues, as well as themselves as much respect, that we are in the office in dresses, if so, also beautiful and elegant.
