Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi the following reasons Voruteile fall 
In order to tell the truth, I was not a particular Fan of Peugeot 206. 
The Fahreigenschaften were not a great deal worth, the quality of Gangschaltung, the management and also the processing could be a more unterdurchschnittlich call.  
But now is its successor, the Peugeot 207, on the market, and the is a long way to go better.  
The Kombi with the name SW is still a bit further, and I will continue to be only, to change my opinion.  
As I the traditional Hatchback the 207 tested a while ago, had I am for example on the too little Kopffreiheit to the Hintersitzen why.  
The complaints are it now no longer, as the Karosserie the Kombi is such a way, that not even Zweimetermänner are suffering will.  
It further 
The Innenausstattung am I just very briefly by, to me not too much to happen again.  
It is not only to a very clear design, where I just for the kümmerlichen Mitteltunnels any comments have.  
In fact would be I more designerische make a good thing, where the car or a so elegant impression is.  
The seats are convenient, and no longer have the time, where we are possible with regard to brief seats or Kopfstützen line.  
The the Seitenhalt has is to the build a great deal better.  
What the Raumangebot is concerned, however, can we make the vergrößerten size the Karosserie feel.  
The Kombi is also the already mentioned problem to Kopffreiheit been removed.  
Luggage in the Kofferraum 
The most important question in this car is but the Laderaum.  
We must I, also for the aufklappbaren Rückfensters draft it as a very good thing beladbar and platzsparend call.  
The Hohlräume are with Haltegurten which, however, the a perfect compromise. . 
You do not interfere, it is auseinanderziehen and our opinion also heavy items said.  
But have we us with regard the Ladevolumen.  
It is the table in the protection. 428 litres, and in the Committee with respect to competition a more average value is.  
Of course not compared to in the Czech Republic meistverkauften vehicle this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.  
If we the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav compared, are we note, however, that the Peugeot to clear very substantial 52 litres act.  
As far as a Auslandsurlaub or the Einladen a Kinderwagens is of the value already critical.  
But in order the Positiva stressed, however, then I have the to the Umklappen the Rücksitze all conditions Laderaum or also the very low Ladekante mention.  
120 PS in four ranks 
Our Testwagen has been with a Vierzylinder-Benzinmotor with Hubraum 1.6 litres and a service of 88 kW power.  
And quite frankly, it should be a 1600-Kubik-Motor be, the a Familien-Hatchback antreibt.  
It is quiet, has a low consumption and is very well off.  
If I it with his counterpart in Škoda Even, the some cases has, rather than would be Auspuff with a Lappen vehicle, then can I of him only look be.  
The Preisliste talking about themselves 
The price of the vehicle is not just favouring.  
We must us but to remind you, however, that we a well equipped car with a geräumigen Innneren and a very good engine tested have.  
The Grundpreis of the cars with the 1400er Benzinmotor in level of 329900 kroner is still in respect of this matter.  
In our engine costs it from 410900 kroner, which I have quite a great deal is.  
The equipment Premium the Testwagens forward once again with 80000 kroner in addition to effect.  
We have had but not Kopfairbags, automatic Klimaanlage, automatic Scheibenwischerauslösung, electrical Fensterheber at and und...  
For example costs the car as a whole straightforward 531900 kroner.  
This is a great deal, but can you again the Zusatzausstattung a Fabia together and you are going to get in a very similar amount.  
This is just the decision, however, the rate will choose it.
