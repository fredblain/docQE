Professor Fred Taylor of the physics department at the Oxford university, a the head of the Group said Express mission, said: ' It is clear, however, why the climate for said so different to the the world is, while the world is otherwise quite similar are concerned. ' 
' The new data make it, a scenario to set, in which the Group said in billions of years such as the world began has, perhaps with a bewohnbarer environment. which
