<seg id="5"> After prices in the lebensmittelmärkten last December davongaloppiert " the prozentuell rise not drastic, compared with the already high, former initial level. </seg>

<seg id="10"> Prices for Unicum and vibrant fish Vorjahresniveau remained practically, have grown sharply, however, are the prices of Putenbrustfilets and poppy, testament. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Prices of flour and bread with the data from the Central Statistics Office of Hungary, Auchan by 1kg, however, there has been Brotwecken for 139 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into. </seg>
<seg id="12"> There was the product of a competitive drop to below 200 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Equally surprising was here, the price of a Pfandflasche two litres of Coca-Cola below 200 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into claimed, so the drink, including HUF only 257 deposits. </seg>
<seg id="14"> However, this year's average Napi in "Warenkorbs-Vergleich Auchan" most expensive, and Cora at best. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Our calculations showed that Cora prices in the "Napi" to the Weihnachtspreisen basket last year to 15, while Auchan Tesco and 18 percent respectively. </seg>

<seg id="18"> The average price increase in the previous year was 1.206,00 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into still, however, the VAT hike imposes price last Christmas. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It is this process has taken the trade predicament: apparently such could not quite decide what preisspanne you in the individual articles should apply, because the consequences of raising prices on consumers incalculable. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This year, such extreme not seen as the most expensive 1.630,00 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into a basket for more expensive than last year, and even the cheapest, there was a 1.284,00 Forints from agricultural-environment protection into of price increases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Compared with the last two Weihnachtssaisons became a disastrous effect of the increase, the price of homes in the Hypermärkten of them in less than 20 months to more than 30 percent. </seg>

<seg id="25"> So in addition to flour with eggs.) </seg>
<seg id="26"> But if you look in the "Napi" market basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, because the price level of expensive product last year, even in the worst case, little more than 10 percent rise. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Mehllieferanten are obviously in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten - it was the drastic increase to the multinationals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Happy Handelsdreieck complain aren't the Hypermarkets starting; it is not by the good years. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Political capital: Staatsrisiko increased Hungarian GUARD </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to the Department for Risk Analysis (risk Analysing division) of political capital, the activities of this August, with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary " formed Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and of the region in several respects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the "Risikowarnungs-Bericht" of the institute says, among other things, that, in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard, the highest political risk, " the tightening of existing ethnic tensions between Gypsy and Nicht-Zigeunerbevölkerung in Hungary, even in the short term to violent ethnic clashes could lead. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, which probably at the provocation of this conflict, such as the one. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> As has been reported, this will be a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People seen in public life, the discussion of the Roma issue representatives of radical political groups, which now has its political strategy on the Roma-Ungarn-Gegensatz have built." </seg>
<seg id="6"> It is believed that this is the problem, the sensible dialogue impossible, injuries, and the likelihood of violent clashes would increase. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Forschungsinsitut ausserdem believes the activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary abroad substantial damage, particularly in terms of confidence in the stability and democratic maturity is concerned." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> We remember that since the autumn of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary steadily on the rise, so since the summer of 2007, "Selbstverteidigungsverein" national organisations were set ablaze. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "These groups share the common characteristic of each define a civil organisation, while you open going to claim that its members - sometimes prepare armed - defence tasks (civil defence, defence, Ordnungshütung), invoking the ineffectiveness of the police, the Army, or the state itself," it said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> It continues: all of this is in accordance with the method tried, several of Parteiverdrossenheit policies and the peoples' political aspirations as civil initiative to disguise. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The emphasis on the civilian character and Vereinsform are not merely the circumvention of legal hurdles in the process of registration could appear in court - it is also a political strategy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> As the analysis suggested that the activities of risikoerhöhenden Hungarian guard a factor for relations with neighbouring states. </seg>
<seg id="13"> " In recent months, the Hungarian guard in several of its neighbours as a potential source quoted some ultranationalistischer politicians of certain neighbouring sees the emergence of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own Anti-Ungarn-Politik. </seg>
<seg id="14"> All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region, " it said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> From the point of view of the institute is the creation of the Hungarian guard Zentral-Ost-Europa no entry in, so the political risk for the entire region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As has been reported that the activities of the Hungarian guard with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose founding in August 2007 from the extreme right-wing Bulgaria BNU National Union (). </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the light of the emergence of Bulgarian guard Roma-Massenausschreitungen were in a built-up areas of Krasna Poljana (Sofia). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BNU has the facts straight to the source of the founding of the National Guard, with the argument that the aim of the Organization of the "national protection." </seg>
<seg id="19"> In their view, was in the past 17 years Zigeunerterror a veritable "significantly" in Bulgaria, the government has, however, remained inactive and indifferent, as political capital. </seg>
<seg id="20"> And further: the initiative had a heated debate in the Bulgarian public opened up. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As I said, the increased risk for ethnic conflict is also shown by the fact that some Roma-Organisationen of Bulgaria announced Widerstandszwecken to their own guards. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Since the activities of the Hungarian guard many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, shows, it is not impossible that the Hungarian Roma with whom to organize their own protection, on the threats, according to the Risikowarnungsbericht of political capital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Forschungsdirektor Attila Juhász, said in political capital on question of the nachrichtenbüros: the analysis is one of the activities of the Forschungsinstitutes. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Risikoanalyseberichte would be published annually, and if risikoverändernden tendencies will be public opinion informed, as in the case by the publication of the Risikowarnberichtes. </seg>

</p>

<seg id="17"> Next year more days' holiday in the Wochenmitte, or at the end of the week, so that the Umdisponierungen working days will be less than this year. </seg>

<seg id="62"> With my voice alone would not be the song never so strongly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Hvg.hu: both on the record, the concert, but the impression that the girls would be in the background. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Yes, it is. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The budget is approved. </seg>

<seg id="5"> It is the first budget that this government has drafted, and without the support of the opposition by the Koalitionsmehrheit was adopted. </seg>
<seg id="6"> For the current year, even with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because it approved Sobotka minister (the party) had presented ČSSD, and therefore could not afford to reject it. </seg>

<seg id="9"> This is a certain irony. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Everything governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether we like it or not. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The budget is an integral part of politics, but it is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition. </seg>
<seg id="12"> This is for the media dankbareres the issue, so you devote more attention to him. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A dispute among politicians in public is much more interesting than sober figures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The budgets were among the last Socialist governments under three weaknesses in the budget for the year 2008 can eliminate all at once. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The first is the high proportion of expenditure, the legitimately binding, and it is not only the pensions, but also social spending, " the implicit ' ČSSD coalition and KSČM (communists) last year before the elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The second is the budget policy as are basic shortages of Schwachpunkts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e., the budget deficits of the communities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The greatest risk is not the state budget deficit. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This budget is publicly and eingermaßen under control. </seg>
<seg id="20"> A real time bomb is the budget deficit of communities. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Many mayors in order but revenue from tax, levies and bank credit other sources of investment, often foolhardy Bond, through its halls in excess indebted. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In recent years, they succeeded, the debt by massive selling shares of energy and other networks in the train of privatization of state had received pay. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Now, the source said grinding to a halt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> As far as we are only at official and verifiable facts, we note that: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Our economy for several years, as the rest of the world is going through a period of the ČSSD vaunted sponsors. </seg>
<seg id="26"> This was a unique opportunity for their governments, public finances in order. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Instead, these governments indebted to the state of even more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have spent much more sensible than our republic. </seg>
<seg id="29"> This is a great shame, mainly the previous governments. </seg>

<seg id="32"> Even if it succeeded in achieving a part of the nonsensical populist spending, which this year before the elections were adopted, it is clear that in the near future to an increase in the retirement age and a pension reform, then ends virtually any policy in this country, and regardless of who is in power, he will remain a purely run. </seg>
<seg id="33"> It is only a slight exaggeration to say that officials from ruling politicians, which is the largest portion of tax revenue mechanically on pensions and social spending. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Therefore, this year's budget is not a revolution, but can only the sweeping Pflichtausgaben normal expenditure. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The scheduled for 2008 deficit of 70 billion kronor would have been quite superfluous in previous governments in the last ten years had spent only. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If we do not want it really comes down to that ruling politicians mere administrators, then we have to be patient and not too strong coalition government, but which are aware that the state is just so much to spend, as he in taxes and fees to occupy the calm in preparing further reform laws. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Owning a car is only the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Because it is even more difficult to find suitable motor insurance as the right Fahrzeugmodell. </seg>
<seg id="5"> First of all, a clear, what we are dealing with. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A take is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This agreement is going through a versicherungsvertrags in writing, which specifies that the society versicherungsprämie agreed and ABN obliged with a Abfindungssumme action disaster. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The versicherungsprämie is the price of insurance, which is made by several factors, including age, gender, date of the creation of a driving licence, family status, kind of insured vehicle or use. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The insurance companies, their prices, according to the statistics, so to a higher risk of higher contributions are payable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> For this reason, both about celebrating as well as women less contributions because, statistics show that these groups, thanks to their caution in a minor accident rate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The same goes for married people, since these, according to the statistical values and therefore also convinced that companies tend to fewer accidents as single. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The benefits will be placed on the vehicle, the frequency of the dangers and the likelihood of an accident. </seg>
<seg id="13"> More common use, the more likely the damage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In the preparation of the insurance Premium must a number of points. </seg>
<seg id="15"> For this reason, the drivers must carefully study the situation to select the take his personal needs most. </seg>
<seg id="16"> We lists at this point, the main items on which the selection of insurance would have to consider, not just a performance, but also a preisorientierte choice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Under the 25-year meeting on the choice of low-cost insurance to many obstacles, such as the  rewarding driving experience and which young  licence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Even if it is an ideal insurance would be best, a Vollkaskoversicherung, there are cheaper alternatives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The cautious drivers Vollkasko can choose to cover, so the Vollkaskoversicherung machines are covered, but at a low price. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This type of treaty means that the customer a fraction of the damage caused by the amount even pay. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> For  before the Treaty and on the basis of the versicherungsprämie levels. This is higher the smaller bezahlende amount to , said Luis Noguera, main exponents of Spain in first Vermittlungsunternehmen Europe, a Online-Versicherungen for. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Another option is the enlarged insurance, the customers against external damage, but not against the car damage incurred. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Furthermore, this type of insurance theft, fire, and Fahrzeugverlust. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> A council. </seg>
<seg id="25"> If you are under 25 years old are, it is in your hands, to reduce the cost of insurance; increases your credit advice, by versuchst to drive carefully and accidents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> A credit advice is a reduction in the basic with the insurance company. </seg>
<seg id="27"> On the contrary, includes a Strafzahlung to an increase in the tariff. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">  The amount of credits and total penalty depend on the society and its earnings. </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the company ertragsreiches a year behind us, can afford Bonus-Zahlungen, , to increase Noguera explained. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Once the 25-Jahre-Marke is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude an agreement. Reason is the fact that with increasing rewarding driving experience the accident rate is falling. </seg>
<seg id="31"> So it is best to Vollkaskoversicherung for one with excesses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">  Usually can do not benefit from their experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of the , not as Vorsteher as the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents in the second Praxisjahr occur after the ,  fear of the Anfängers was obtained. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Nevertheless, it is a married customers, not children possess a Vollkaskoversicherung wiser. But only, of course, if the financial situation of the person in question also allows. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> From the insurers are couples with children as customers with the lowest accident rate, and correspondingly low their contributions come from. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> In this case is Vollkaskoversicherung with a cover (for a sum to 300 euros) the best option. In the case that a high credit advice has been received, is an expanded insurance, the only the third Fahrzeugjahr. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">  They go as a whole should be more relaxed and have more purchasing power, allowing them to pay a larger , Luis Noguera. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> For pensioners, it is Vollkaskoversicherung, one with excesses (for a sum to 150 euros), or an expanded insurance, who got a sufficiently high credit advice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Ultimately you have to Bear in mind that the take something very important, not only because they are the drivers against possible damage, but also because of high costs, require that a thorough selection, our personal situation. </seg>

<seg id="10"> The toughest and longest exchange of the evening between Rudy Giuliani was the national champion, and Romney, who is in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire has moved forward. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Giuliani shackles tried the reputation that he was soft on illegal immigration, when he was mayor of New York. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He was attacking Romney in the former governor of Massachusetts accused, illegal immigrants for work on his house to have stopped. </seg>

<seg id="16"> At least in the area of immigration parts the candidates basically the same views: tighter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This issue, combined with fears over toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, help the Republicans the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives to forget or. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But the debate has been clearly problematic than other issues were raised. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Gordon Brown has yet another hineinfallen discovered the hole; its way out of this game will remain the same. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> For British scandals, the schlüpfrig does not. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Seem a title held by any politician, sold Hotelrechnungen in Paris not having paid gelutscht cloves. </seg>
<seg id="5"> But the revelation that a rich businessman donations for Britain's governing Labour Party on more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name disguised by other people, and that the party failed to live up to that, is something without which the disputed territory of Gordon Brown would be well managed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As two months ago the prime minister of the demand for an election from dämliche had the intelligence of British insulting, by stating that opinion polls this decision had not influenced, there was hope that a robust and efficient government would offer. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly Vertretungsvorsitzende clever, the Liberal Democrats, said, once the most dreaded Brown by Stalin to Mr. Bean. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The heavy-handed rescue of Northern Rock, a wounded bank showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under siege. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Ill-conceived proposals to change the tax code, business groups against the government. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The steuerbehördliche loss of personal data of 25 million people showed incredible administrative pick. </seg>
<seg id="11"> A trio of retired generals launched an insurgency in the House of Lords in protest at cuts in spending: minister of the armed forces, they said, is a teilzeitjob. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now there are the many donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary-General (and your former Erfüllungsleiter) is already resigned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> None of this means that Brown irrevocably direction departure. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless, governments can a turning point, after which they find it impossible to govern. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Neither may still have confidence people politicians, but they usually keep their scepticism, if a new force takes office. </seg>
<seg id="16"> If it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister, the situation improves, and they need not even a long time is this postponement: public service begins leaking; the cabinet ministers chatting start; the press is looking for bad news, and the government is defensive and no ambition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In a way that is the position of Brown is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders cannot claim a new broom. </seg>
<seg id="18"> He likes to Tony Blair would deny he was his lieutenant. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The problems with Northern Rock and the Steuerzuständigkeitsunterlagen, for example, hang together with decisions that Brown as chancellor of the Finance Ministry. </seg>
<seg id="20"> And even if not directly was involved in Blair's mishaps - as in the long "money for title held by" study of political parties, the voters may be working on the assumption that he was. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not quite as bad as it looks </seg>
<seg id="22"> The errors are not quite as horrible as the conservative they describe. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Like Mr. Bean, nobody died or has beschwindelt altogether. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And the antidote, painful as they may be, is deliver what Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies are promised: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The new song and dance about political donations is a good example. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The garboeske Abrahams, its donations, with its charitable gifts, he says, comparing wish no public recognition for his benevolence. </seg>
<seg id="27"> This may be the case, but the decision was not for him. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The laws against anonymity for great political contributors are clear, and they exist in a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those who govern the country. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Watt, who says he should have known by Abrahams agreement, but not that it is illegal, of course, some questions, just as Mendlesohn Jon, Labour's Hauptfinanzeintreiber, on the odd donations have been told in October. </seg>
<seg id="30"> But so far, Brown is not included: there is nothing that indicates that he knew of this confusion, although most of the payments after he took office in June. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> To date, the prime minister half the job. </seg>
<seg id="32"> He has quickly the violation of the law by his party, but he watered-down this determination by seizing a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry conducted on the subject, to complete the picture, a bishop in retirement and a judge. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In this case, the "lessons learned" not very complicated. </seg>
<seg id="34"> If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Apart from that there are other things which Mr. Brown must be done, as something of a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, to find vacant for six months, and move forward with a drastic reform of political parties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The dignity of the hard-liners of the labour demand with the conservative to collaborate and possibly the special financial relationship with the unions, bitter tablets for a party members such as Mr. Brown. </seg>
<seg id="37"> But he should have some partisan facts. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls; he has two years to voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory, is unquestionable probity and solid competence. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Who is supposed to be number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Bopara Shah or Ravi? </seg>
<seg id="4"> And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second question is important because, Graveney David, Wahlvorsitzende, to call at least at this particular title, is Cheftrainer, Peter Moore's and captain Michael Vaughan and help to decide, and because the table of Morries high, the English managing director with applications to slowly for national Wählerämter fills, if not for what in part-time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Whoever the sixth Schlägerposition not, will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport, it is certainly. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is never easy, just want a person, which allows for the top of its berufszweiges, and somebody else never hinauskommt the lowest rank, sometimes because of a lack of good fortune rather than ability. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is not only in cricket, where the choice is difficult, where decisions are needed, which are at the end of subjective. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It is the right time for Bopara levels? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Is it fair to Shah if it does? </seg>
<seg id="11"> The same can perhaps in another area to be asked whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good qualifications, the business familiar, should be promoted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Who can say what the right class for a cricketers, unless he has the opportunity to be submerged or swim. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Of course, pay a great influence on decisions, but prospects of it. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Within a team needs a cricketers master's eye at the right time, if he can take a Wicket and a bat, regular opportunities in order when he, as a one-day cricketers impression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The eyes of the Auswähler to catch is more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="16"> There were many who last season better than, for example, when James Anderson, who appears to play in the first test, even if Harmison Stephen themselves as healthy and as the wind in the nets kegelt. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Anderson took Wickets 32 first-class with 33 Runs a position on this tour. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Chris Tremlett, only 29 with the same modest average, but both had its high points and hope for more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Whether Bopara Shah or Asgiriya stage plays in, can only be a Ansichtsfrage. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The election could the careers of both men, or it might make little difference. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs, however, it was Paul Collingwood at kämpfend to consolidate the breakthrough to a major Testkricketspieler expeditions and even though he was a double hundred against Australia in punktete Australia, perhaps still undervalued. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Probably that Graveney is, Vaughan and Moore's, after a further discussion within Netzsitzung of Asgiriya today in stage its conservative instincts and bauchgefühl Shahs for greater experience of Boparas youthful enthusiasm will follow. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> There are arguments for both. </seg>
<seg id="24"> For funkelnden Shah says his Test-Debüt-Innings and valuable 88 in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds, and only six of the Bopara, with 22 years is seven years younger, and their angedrehtes record against bullets. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But Shah only 10 Runs in his two Innings in May against West Indies on the test in Lord, its Heimatarena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus its immediate rejection of the Auswählern as Vaughan healthy was his position for the next game seems to reverse the momentum from his proposal, which was obviously in Mumbai. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> By contrast, the Alleskönner schaufelweise appetite for Essex. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He is nothing Kricketplatz impressed on a remote and its attitude, it was to come to the point, when he recently Vierradantrieb a car with an exhibition for England sponsor Volkswagen in rapid succession. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was his Vodafone gesponsort (of course), Teamkollegen; and his to Alastair Cook who watched from afar and enthusiasm to say: " Have you seen this? '. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Bopara is Feldspieler a much better kegelt, Mitteltempo be here with some effect on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and proposes with confidence and skill. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The right man to vote is one thing, the right moment to select a different. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Perhaps this is the real art of choice. </seg>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "Murderous peace" can be out: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo Topol (Adrian, Max Riemelt), which is a Serbin before Kosovar sniper salvage what a prompt still in love with them. </seg>

<seg id="16"> Because the stories are so diverse: both times small teams go into the forest, something that is not what the military can and on both occasions, there will be a trip to the madness. </seg>

<seg id="17"> One of the reasons for the failure of "the hunting party" is that Simon Hunt not just the ramshackle cynics with heart than us at the beginning. </seg>
