England confronted with decision on the statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them in an almost just as difficult way asthe other one.
Who is supposed to beat as a number 6 for England into Kandy at this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is supposed to make the decision?
The second question is important, because David Graveney, the choice chairperson, on call at least under this specific title, here is, around which to help Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan with deciding manager, and because the table of High Morries, the English managerial director, fills itself with applications for national voter offices by degrees, otherwise even for which ones in partial time.
Whoever does not get the sixth brawler position will be unhappy, but the life is often unfair and the sport is it beyond doubt.
It is never simple to nail exactly what a human being facilitates to reach the top of his of Berufszweiges while somebody is differently never coming out about the lowest rank sometimes for lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection, where judgments which are always at the end subjective are necessary, is difficult.
It is the correct time for Bopara climb up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
That resembles can be asked maybe also in one further field, whether for example John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee should be conveyed, both intelligent young managers with good ends that know the business well.
Who can say what the correct class is for a cricketer, unless, the possibility to swim or to sink is given to him.
As a matter of course numbers have a great influence on decisions, but chances also have this.
Within a team a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain to the correct time, if it can take a Wicket and a brawler must get regular chances on the order if it wants to do impression as a one-day cricketer.
To catch the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many which were better in the last season than, for example, as James Anderson, who will play seemingly in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares itself as healthy and bowls as the wind into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with each 33 runs in order to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but they both had their highlights and hope for still more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in the Asgiriya Stadium can be only an opinion question.
The choice could decide on the careers of both men, or nevertheless maybe it does little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, it was, however, Paul Collingwood to consolidate then still fightingly around himself that created the breakthrough to a significant test cricketer and that, although it scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, maybe still is underestimated.
Probable is, that Graveney, Vaughan and bog, after a further discussion in the course of the present net meeting in the Asgiriya Stadium will follow their conservative instincts and stomach feeling for Shahs greater experience above Boparas youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 Test-Deb√ºt-Innings into Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara that is younger with 22 years seven years, and an excellent balance against rolling turned on.
But Shah did Indies only ten runs in his two Innings in the May against west in the test in lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate refusal of the selectors as Vaughan healthy was in order to take back his position for the next game it seems to have taken the swing that was still manifest in Bombay from his beating.
In Contrast the all-rounder has shovel-wise high spirits from Essex.
It is not impressed from anything on a cricket place and was brought his attitude off on the point, than he had estimated a vehicle with four wheel drive recently in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and presumably a shock, but the First that he did was his Vodafone (natural also gesponsort) to get out and to call his team colleague Alastair Cook that had observed this from the distance, and to say his team colleague Alastair Cook that had observed this from the distance with enthusiasm: "You saw that"?.
Bopara is a much better field player, he bowls his central speed with some effect here on the grounds, what it seems to match to it and beats with confidence and fate.
To elect the correct man is a thing, to choose the correct time another.
Maybe that is the actual art of the selection.
I bend for this purpose his chance to give to Bopara now, what does not mean that nevertheless maybe Shah will not stand good if, suggested as the tea sentence from Ceylon, he is that one that will play here this weekend.
