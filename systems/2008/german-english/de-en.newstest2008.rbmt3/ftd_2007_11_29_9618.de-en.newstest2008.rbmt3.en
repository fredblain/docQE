The smallest federal state is during the professional training carrying on and shines even with the international direction of his colleges.
Only in an education field the same deficit presses the Saarlanders as the rest of the country.

First future comparison studies will show whether the services of the pupils improve lastingly.
Near Pisa 2003 the part of the risk pupils of 29 on 20 percent shrank.
In total Saarland did not increase itself as strongly, however, as other federal states did.
The Bavarians calculate better.
