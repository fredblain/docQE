British army recruits on YouTube
Units of the British army published photos about operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan for the purpose of popularity increase on the video portal.
First of all the British air force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan load since March 2006 videos about operations led against the Taliban into the net, the BBC tells.
The photos turned with miniature cameras attached on helmets are controlled at the air force foothold in Kandahar and sent then to London, where they are put into the Internet.
Political message unavoidable
Soldiers of the air force contributed in already 139 such photos, was had at their "channel" a look more than 75.000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense became under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring 2007 also the British Department of State (Commonwealth Office) registers in order to publish videos, however, about Iraqi and Afghan operations and the international peace troops stationed in Iraq (MNFI) have own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
Originally the air force recruited the videos with the objective soldiers, publishes, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions serve also the purpose for informing the population of the actual objectives of the foreign actions.
Such kind's published propaganda is almost free in comparison with traditional television commercials, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, however, these videos always take a certain measure of political message into themselves since they confirm the right to exist of the military measures decided on by the government in own way.
Recruiting Americans with game
The army must fight, however, also against amateur photos that get it also into the net next to the carefully dealt, zensurierten photos - as about such that show the death of the soldiers: In the a little hypocritical, "official" propaganda films talks about the losses at most, the bloody pages of the war are not shown, however.
From the theaters of war in Iraq and in Afghanistan after all already numerous videos turned in the use were loaded onto the platform, the Britons discovered this "type" only recently, however, for themselves.
Meanwhile the Americans recruit in the a little different way, indeed with the freely herunterladbaren firing-game "America's Army" in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier within the framework of a more or less life-loyal simulation.
