Venus is the infernal twin of the earth
The Venus is more similarly than up to now thought in spite of their life-hostile atmosphere of the earth: The European space probe "Venus Express" has flashes in the atmosphere and wind whirl at the poles discovers how they occur in the winter also on the earth.
Since almost three decades scientists presume that it flashes on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" produced the proof - she traced electro-magnetic waves on the fringe of the atmosphere: The flashes on the Venus fire in a height from cloud to cloud of about 56 kilometers, Christopher Russel of the University of California tells in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen-Theorie" flashes made the life arise on the earth: Thunderstorms are supposed to have stimulated in the ocean reactions that led to the education from amino acids the elements of the life.
Not so on the Venus: "If there were ever lives over there, it must have been in the very early history", Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution declares in Washington.
Today there might hardly be on the surface of the Venus something live: The atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on the earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus is maybe the devil twin of the earth, but she is a twin", Russel said.
Why the Venus is, the the earth in mass and size so similar, a so entirely different development has struck, the Esa-Mission is the basic question.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus-research since since beginning of the nineties no probe anymore was especially on the way for the exploration of this planet.
The newest research results, that "are imagined" now in several "Nature"-Artikeln, do not underline in the view of the researchers only the uniqueness of the Venus within the solar system.
"You also show that the common characteristics of our neighbor planet with the earth are greater than first of all accepted" the Esa informs.
The researchers found like this also a cloud whirlpool next to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole at the South Pole which turns still considerably more quickly.
The phenomenon reminds of airflows on the earthly winter hemisphere, a team of researchers writes around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-innermost planet of the solar system has the almost same mass as the earth does and is almost just as big with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The planet referred to also as a morning or evening star circles in just 225 days around the sun.
He turns itself much more slowly, however, around themselves: A Venus day lasts 243 earth days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees of centigrades and a pressure of 92 cash hardly reminds of the earth, scientists assume that both planets had arisen under very similar conditions.
On both water that remained on the earth on which Venus, however, got lost into the space in oceans was collected.
And while carbon dioxide is being fixed on the earth in carbonate rocks, it defines the majority of the atmosphere on the Venus.
