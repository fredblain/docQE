A colleague informs of the photo of illegal Internetdownloads into the penal code:
A. The Download of a song would be a law break, that affects with six months of custody.

B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft becomes then indeed as Straftateingestuft, nevertheless the punishment precipitates in a smaller way than at a Download (Article 234 penal code).
C. If you steal a car and return it later again forty hours, the punishment is still smaller then than at a Download (Article 244.1).

My family doctor presents one of his long, strange research articles with the title to me: Money leads to activation of certain brain fields, particularly, if the other ones get more from that.
Therefore the feelings arising through the monthly payment of salary are dependent on the content of the colleagues.
The study was created with the aid of a tomographisch-magnetic reference analysis at the Bonn university, and the results were published in the last edition of the science-magazine Science.
According to statement of Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner brain research center Life&Brain, the activation was then strongest if the participant gave correct answers and on the other hand his other player failed.
The researchers could recognize that the brain activities always very much moderat turned out if both participants with their answer were correct and got also the same salary accordingly; but if one of them received the double one, it resulted also in a stronger brain activity.
I am not sure to myself, whether in fact it requires so much scientific expenditure to reach for such a result.
