It all rakes want to do - or as one becomes uninteresting forother
Stop and go-Verkehr, the car right in the allmorgendlichenjam.
From the radio a strange melody rings out: The sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume more highly.
The speed changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a feminine choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar which rings out onmr2.
The domestic music scene did just not spoil us long time with qualitative Electropop.
However, now one sees even the jam different if one hears the new album of Zagar in this case.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so manch new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground scene contribute slowly to a change of the overall picture, and self when the garage skirt with his Gitarrengequitsche is again "in" the domestic Electropop proves: There is new one under the sun.
Balázs Zságer began in Pécs, played music even in the band Yonderboi, before it - maybe, because an inn takes none two piper - his own way to walk along began.
It created the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music that melts elements together from jazz, Electronic, and pop, however, first than one with the request, to compose the soundtrack for a film, onto it had confronted (e.g..
"Szezon" of Ferenc Töroek).
The formation that at the beginning had performed in smaller clubs became known to the wider public first, as the magazine "wan2" their first album from the year 2002 under the top 50 domestic nightmares followed and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to the almost only one chose, also in the west marketable trendsetter.
Without a doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", it did not interest, however, any whether they bear this brand also with pleasure.
The band reacted, as it should: With a new, even better album.
The now appeared new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could reveal them new ways, however, already the title expresses the wish with the Pécser years according to continuity.
The expression originates indeed from the time, when Balázs Zságer was still on the way with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be also in order, to fall, however, next to the ethereal character of the music the - corresponding to the spirit of the time and the trends - louder guitar, the influences of the rock'n'roll on.
With these songs the singer Gyoergy Ligeti living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle" introduced himself during the premiere in the Millenáris.
A song of the album created it even for the radio hit - that as of quite recently of early set to mr2 Petfi sending pop music late to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love" that was recorded by six domestic singers ("Underground Divas") under collaboration successively the earwig.
Everything all right therefore (?).
The hvg.hu asked with Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent does your music of a certain shift keep on being reserved?
Balázs Zságer: The concept "shift music" doesnot intimate just much to me.
In my opinion there are two castes in the pop music, and indeed not main stream and underground, or Alternativ and pop, but Kommerziell and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground-music can be shallow and meaningless, just the same they can also be produced, however, only for the sale which turns it into commercial music.
Also a good pop-number can arise from an honest motive.
The acceptance of the listener functions also according to this principle, independently of languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the frankness of the Hungarian one and the foreign public opposite your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, in particular west of us the pop music has a greater tradition.
There not only teenagers or Twens onto concerts, but also the older public go.
You pursue the trends in the pop music that pass around them around, much more attentive, because they hold it also for a part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: Which role is attributed to the public during yourwork?
It is important, who, where, how many hear your music?
B. Zs.: A good feeling to see is natural it that to come to our concerts more and more.
We have never composed, however, for the market.
With us the music does not arise in order to be used for a purpose but for a certain reason.
The role of the public is perceptible mostly at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is that one in turn only in the unreachable changes of the moment.
Nevertheless one struck me: You want to make it all right, you are not more interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example fromYonderboi?
It is as a soloist on the way and ratherestablished his career in the west.
B. Zs.: We do not go in fact his way, once from that very foreseen that one attempts again and again to interpret this in into our music.
We rather see ourselves than Teamplayer who trust in the musical presence of the other one and they make themselves unfold.
At the beginning comparisons of our work with that one were of course inevitable from Yonderboi since several of us come from his band and took another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petfi "Wings of Love"stands at first place.
Many heard the name Zagar first in connection with thisnumber.
Was the opening with an a little more popular style in the direction consciously of a wider public produced?
B. Zs.: We did not have any plans to write a hit which then is supposed to serve as a train horse for the album.
In this song it is a question of more.
It was considered as a final of the album with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the a little more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just they, what the leading-principle was?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to do a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea to put together the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene came.
So the six-headed choir arose - therefore Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh -, that we christened to apäter "Underground Divas" then.
hvg.hu: You wanted to have the song just the same, or did the girls co-design it?
B. Zs.: There was the number already longer in the instrumental version, but when the material was ready for the album, we thought that this number still needs something.
The piecework sequence demanded ceremonially according to asong voice.
I sang the melody still in the same night, later the girls learned it.
It everything came virtually immediately and frightening spontaneous.
I can remember, I was then quite electrified, but one already needed also the "divas".
With my voice alone the song would never have become sostrong.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate, when also during the concert one had, however, the impression the girls would be in the background.
There is not any solo part (foreseen from the short solo from Judy Jay), they do not have any own role, they completely sing together and they are not louder, as the music, therefore their song is not only accompanied from the music.
Also on the stage they stood behind.
Is it intention?
B.Zs.: That they stood behind was like this because ofproblems technical in that.
However we wanted to them consciously not to made any soloroles be attributed.
In the number it is a question also of one being supposed to forget his ego a little bit, forgotten, who from where come and where it is on the way, we let in simply too, that us lift these certain wings, the wings of the love.
I would have with pleasure, that also other sense this euphoric state that we sensed than the song arose.
hvg.hu: Which one was the most extensive song?
B. Zs.: During the musical work work of no actually at all, there were rather while mixing more difficult tasks.
For example with "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or with "rock'n'roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove did not want to function longer, nevertheless little by little everything turned out, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which one is your darling number of the new album?
B. Zs.: That changes with the concerts constantly and also now, where I have the album "losgelasssen".
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
