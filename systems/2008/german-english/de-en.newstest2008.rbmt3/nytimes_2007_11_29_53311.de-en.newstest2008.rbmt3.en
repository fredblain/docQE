Bungled operation presumed with death in New Jersey
It the day was here before the Thanksgiving Day as Ronald Livingston through the big glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant saw and observed as an ambulance at the white cape Cod two doors wider below at the west Scott Avenue stopped.
Soon on that a police car was there.
And then a further one was there.
"Then I saw the box car of the medical coroner approaching", Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, said, on Wednesday.
"That was the point than I knew that somebody had died."
The Beh√∂ren found out that the dead Ms Olga Arroyo, 41, was, an assistant of the director of the Newarker police department.
Now the observers attempt to find out whether she died because of a procedure that was carried out by a not authorized, cosmetic surgeon that the police did not identify and that in the house at the west Scott Avenue 212 worked.
The authorities did not find yet what Ms Arroyos has caused death, and are hopeful, that toxokologische investigations that results could be unavailable for weeks will help with clearing up a mysterious death the one grief through the leadership top of the Newark Polizei has sent.
An assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, was Ms Arroyo since September 2006, and their voice was known to many in the department.
"It was loyal, hard working and stubborn", Mr McCarthy said about Ms Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my Pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said, that Ms Arroyo was the woman of Jimmy Arroyo, to one former Newarker police officers, that works for the Alkoholkontrollkomission, and that they leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a speaker for the public prosecutor of union county, Theodore J. Romankow, said that observers would attempt to find out whether Arroyo passed away as a result of a not approved, surgical treatment.
"That is one of the possibilities", Ms Walsh said.
"It is a current investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon in November.
And they found Ms Arroyo on a sofa.
It was declared on site for death.
More than one week went by and the authorities informed of little about their investigation or over that one owner of the house that is presented as a pile Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Ms Castro was consulted bythe authorities.
The observers attempt to find out whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday nobody opened the door at woman Castros house where a wilted rose shrub is in the brief front garden and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labels with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - was in the parking place next to a door that led to the basement.
Zwei Mountainbikes hanged from hooks on a page.
McCarthy said, that than it arrived for the first time in Newark, after he had spent 25 years with the New York police department, Ms Arroyo of inestimable value was and it helped him in this case to zurechtfinden in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You must pay attention to this or that'" hesaid.
"It was always here, than I arrived here and it wasalways here when I went.
It was embarrassing."
