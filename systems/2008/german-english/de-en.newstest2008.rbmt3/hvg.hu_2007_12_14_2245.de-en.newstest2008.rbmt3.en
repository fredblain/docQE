Six quenching trifles, in order to annoy colleagues
E-mails which we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that do not strike us anymore at all: You bring "color" into the everyday life at the job.
The question whether one becomes accustomed to these small inconveniences is bare or one is confronted better with the challenge and attempts these misleading, for other annoyed situations consciously too vermweiden.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that somebody of the marketing department called - a colleague says".
That one missed a meeting through that?
At best one regrets it and attempts to make up again when maybe one phones the marketing department and confesses remorsefully one would have forgotten, to achieve the information (that is that one little usual method).
Mostly the thing with an excuse is laughed away.
Before one involves oneself in embarrassing excuses, one should consider, with which one can truly prepare unpleasant moments for his colleagues and attempt to avoid these situations consciously.
A little borrowed, which does not belong to one even?
There is not hardly a little Pithier than if one grasps a document, office accessories, or the telephone nevertheless it is not there.
Yesterday the notebook device still lay on the desk - it is today earlyaway?
Or that one is lost believed ball-point pens discovered for instance on the desk of a colleague?
Without one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow, because they are annoyed that something disappeared if they find.
Therefore, no envelopes or Post-its from the office put into the bag, because it could affect one even: no one more there, if nevertheless man's needs urgently.
Getratsche about the private life of the colleagues?
There is not any effective means to stop a gossip which already was started.
Who with whom, done something?
Where and why?
One should not tie the information (or supposition) about the private life of the colleagues as far as possible to everyone to the nose!
And if nevertheless somebody opens for himself and his innermost secret betrays us, we should not misuse this confidence!
Best one keeps quiet as a grave, instead of that just not person presents to adjust even if other know also answer about the problems of the colleague.
Without reason in a sick way announced?
If one calls in the office in order to answer under appointment on tormenting headaches in a sick way because one just feels uneasy, or only simply liked to take a rest, one should realize one thing: The own work, unaufschiebbare Erledigungen, the colleagues must finish projects with fixed appointments now instead of one even.
Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore!
If one knows already on day before that one will not get it into the office on the next day, or that something could get in the way, for which one must stay at home, one should announce it in time, in this way neither the colleagues, to be confronted still the head unexpectedly with the absence.
Gesumme, giggle, making a call
One is hollow just in his work, is disturbed, however, suddenly from the loud giggle of the colleagues?
Overheard unintentionally a telephone conversation, which one should not have heard better?
One should say the colleagues not with sums, singing, conversations (that one leads over their heads), trample, permanent chiding or moaning irritate.
That all can be very much bothering also if they are not hollow just in a task (to write people organize people plan).
Are always the other ones guilty?
A project is not period of time-raked ready, one has an important letter or forgotten important Nachrichte to send, one should not search the fault of the own forgetfulness at other!
As far as possible one should not talk out onto the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
Best one admits his errors, and apologizes if other were affected also by that!
The question how one can make up for the error again, or make up for the missed thing is only far too made!
In the office - a feeling as at home?
Tracksuit bottoms and Schlapfen: Force for at home, nothing lost, however, in the office!
Not even then one should dress so leger if the job approved it actually!
Only not to become too slovenly - one should both his colleagues, than also themselves even so far respect, that one dresses in according to the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
