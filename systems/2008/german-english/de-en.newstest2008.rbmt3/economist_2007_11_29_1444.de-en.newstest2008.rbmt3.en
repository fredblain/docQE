Everything still open
Mitt Romey said, he does not consider worthily of a premiership candidate to be consulted from a snowman.
In spite of that the republican candidate for the premiership declared himself ultimately readily to be confronted with a debate on YouTube in which normal voters video questions and submit questions in order to send it to the candidate.
None of the questions that were raised at the Wednesday evening, the 28th November, were as ridiculous as the snowman was, the democrats' about the global warming in the YouTube Debatte of the other party questioned.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time the state of the republican party which opens into the choices in the next year exactly.
It is not known, exactly as the producers of CNN, which supported the debate that clips selected the prospective candidate to YouTube to be shown.
Yet in the first half hour of the debate, the longest the a single topic was dedicated, immigration stood in the center.
The topic is one of the strongest topics for republicans.
The CNN asked a group to operate a dial from undecided voters if they heard things that they liked: The TV organization noticed tops of the approval than the candidates talked about the borders severely.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner, and Romney which shifted itself forward in the decisive inquiries in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call, it was soft with regard to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in that it the former governor immigrants accused by Massachusetts, illegal for work at his house have prepared.
The two stopped especially hard than interrogators asked whether an "amnesty" (that would give illegal a regular status and the possibility onto the citizenship) would support to one of the candidates.
More insignificant candidates as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congress representative, and Tom Tancredo, a congress representative from Colorado, it succeeded with this topic nachzuhaken.
No one of the two men has serious chances during the nomination, but both stay in the running, maybe because they formerly and in a harder way beat onto the immigration bass drum as other.
To divide into the field of the immigration at least the candidates on the whole the same opinions: sharper borders, intolerance opposite illegal migrants.
This topic, together with fears about poisonous toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world, the differences help the republicans with forgetting or minimizing between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate brought unequivocally problematic as other topics for the language.
Mr Giuliani was asked to, for which it supported arm restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed about whether simulated drowning should be considered as torture.
One of the interrogators asked whether the candidatesbelieve every word of the Bible.
This resulted in Giuliani representing the point of view that although the Bible is his preferred book, it the history of Jonah and the whale maybe not literal believes.
A further interrogator asked whether Jesus would support the deathpenalty|capital punishment.
Mike Huckabee - now towards all expectations on the first place in an inquiry recently carried out in Iowa thanks to his Christian Konservativismus existing for a long time - it said that the death penalty is painful, but necessary.
When he was pushed on whether Jesus would approve it, he laughed at that and said Jesus was too intelligent in order to apply for a political office.
The race remains unusually far open.
Huckabees rise in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls recent donation successes and his storms of applause in the debate of Wednesday.
These two shot up from the nothingness, because the two wings of the party up to now not yet onto one of the better known and more traditional candidates of some could.
Per year in 1980 and 2000 a candidate united the party with a victorious message about the size of Americas and a winking to both wing of the party from the beginning and convincingly.
This time the party is fissured and the result is not clear by far.
