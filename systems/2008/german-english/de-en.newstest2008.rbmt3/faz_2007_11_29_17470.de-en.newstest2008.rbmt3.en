Those ones are not Warhols boxes
Who combines the concepts of Swedes and Holzkiste thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or nevertheless?
Currently dark shadows fling work list into wooden boxes produced to Swedes on Warhols.
A majority of the ninety-four there listed Brillo-boxes of the "type Stockholm" are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper stirred up Expressen some months ago doubts about the genuineness of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes of the year 1968, internal enquiries come in the Moderna Museet into Stockholm now for a sobering result: The six "Brillo-Boxes" that the former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed to the Moderna Museet in 1995 as donation are copies - and presumably also the majority of the about a hundred more Brillo boxes of the "Typ Stockholm" that are on the international art market in circulation.
The case history is encapsulated, a confusing concatenation of artistic and kuratorischer productions.
In 1964 Warhol got his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes which are based on the red-blau-weissen design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo", into New York.
An exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet 1968 exhibited hundreds of Brillo-boxes - with Warhols consent - of cardboard: These did not come (from Kostengründen) from Warhol, but they were delivered directly from the Brillo board mill.
It was a question not of works of art, but of their models, around bare exhibits.
Simultaneously Warhol gave in 1968 presumably the permission to make of a few Brillo wooden boxes which, however, were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet be produced in Sweden.
Time witnesses speak now of about fifteen boxes which then shrank as authorized Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the denomination "Typ Stockholm" to right into the art and auction history.
Some of them achieved more than 100 000 dollars on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén claimed later by mistake, it is in 1968 produced about a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden that Warhol left to him then and exhibited.
In fact Hulténs 105 boxes were produced only in 1990 in Malmoe for an exhibition in hr. Petersburg.
To this time Warhol was already three years dead.
Lars Bystroem, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, examined next to that one six museum-own Brillo-Boxes also three from Swedish private property, of which two 1968 in Stockholm were made: Your pressboard plates were primed first and ground off, after that white oil paint with a paintbrush was put on.
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 on the other hand betrays that the color with a painter role without undercoat was applied directly to the pressboard plate - in addition it is not a question around Oil-, but around acrylic color.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes by the official list", the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve lets announce: "When the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication' comes board' in New York not to another end, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in his collection as copy/exhibition material.
Already in July certainly the Authentication Board announced to follow the "difficult accusations" that are raised as regards the soap powder boxes.
However, since then one wraps oneself in relentless silence there.
