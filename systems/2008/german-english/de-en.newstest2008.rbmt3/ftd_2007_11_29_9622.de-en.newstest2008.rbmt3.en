Deutschen threatens 2007 wage minuses
In spite of the strong economic situation a real wage loss threatens according to German employees of a prediction this year.
Experts named a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic prediction.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler-donation the employees could really reckon in 2007 less on the salary account than in the previous year.
The modest wage development, the value added tax increase and the price pushes with foods and energy are guilty at that, Gustav Horn of the institute said for macroeconomics and business research of the "picture"-newspaper.
New loads could come up also with the unemployment insurance to employees.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the "Neuen Osnabrücker newspaper", the planned drawdown of the unemployment insurance on 3,3 percent to the change of year is correct indeed and reasonable in the present situation.
However, the federal agency must not come for work to have to ask for credits or subsidies with the Federal Government again in embarrassment, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it had become known that the price explosion drove the inflation rate onto the highest state with foods and mineral oil products since 13 years.
The prices increased in total around 3,0 percent in the year comparison.
