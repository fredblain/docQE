From Beust criticism gathers for Olympic-refusal
The moving away of the mayor of the application of Hamburg for Olympic Summer Games bumped with politics and economy onto vehement criticism.
Many keep on wanting to fight for the games at the water.
However from Beust realism sends a reminder with|in the caseof the assessment of the chances.
The main manager of the Hamburg chamber of commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described on Wednesday a renunciation when "not good for the economic location".
No other project developed in recent time so great motivation strengths in the city as the Olympic idea did.
"Without this objective the sport-political swing could not be maintained in the same measure."
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate "which takes a changed time ray as a basis" not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach for that.
Mayor Ole of Beust stayed on Wednesday with former statements according to which at least the Olympic aspirations of Hamburg are unrealistic up to the year 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides about an Olympic application, but the German Olympic" sport Federal Government", said from Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the sport Federal Government about an application of Munich for the winter games 2018 expected for beginning of December.
"This preference means for us that we will not have any realistic chances in the period up to now thought by us to 2028."
Nevertheless the dream is not for all time dream, said from Beust.
The Hamburg sport Federal Government (HSB) regrettedthe statements of Beusts.
The impression that Hamburg does not want to apply in the next 25 years anymore for Olympic Games is given by that.
It is too early to obstruct a chance when one the plans buried already to this time", HSB president of Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the application stands furthermore contrary to the statement of the senate leader on the occasion of a reception to the plenary session of the General German College Port Association.
There from Beust the application of Hamburg for the Universiade 2015 did not describe as substitute" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The college port association had nominated as an applicant city only in the last week Hamburg.
The SPD citizens faction reproached the senate not to have used valuable time for the house building in Hamburg.
"The Development of the Small Grasbrooks was delayed by the senate for years because he put Olympia on the card and "ignored" the house building", the SPD-representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD was always demanding an integrated planning for the Kleinen Grasbrook for Olympia and a later living-use, the CDU put on one side on the "event-factor".
The Application for the Olympic Summer Games 2012 had activated a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at that time.
Leipzig had defeated, however, Hamburg.
