Which insurance is suitable for me best?
The KFZ insurance that covers a possible damage case caused by the driver contains a high cost whose height wiederrum depends on different factors, and other from age, sex, time of the creation of the driver's license, marital status, kind of the car to be insured and his use, and so forth.
To own a car is only the beginning.
Because the suitable KFZ insurance is to be found in an even more difficult way than the correct vehicle model is.
At first once it must be clear to one with what we have to do it here.
An selfinsurance is an agreement between an assurance company and an insured.
This agreement to present the corresponding indemnity in a damage case is held in writing by means of a contract of insurance which determines that the society receives the arranged insurance premium and is engaged in the corresponding train.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that consists through several factors, and other age, sex, time of the creation of the driver's license, marital status, kind of the vehicle to be insured or that use.
The insurance enterprises set their prices according to the statistics so that with a higher danger of accident also higher contribution payments become due.
For this reason must both more than 25-year than also women of few contribution payments achieve, because statistics prove that these groups show a smaller accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same one is valid also for married persons, there this according to statement of the statistical values and accordingly also according to conviction of the enterprises, to less accidents tend as singles.
The benefit that is attributed to the vehicle influences the frequency of the driving and in this way also the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more probably the damage.
The insurances must consider a whole series of points at the installation of the premium.
For this reason also the driver must study the situation thoroughly in order to select the selfinsurance which complies with his personal needs at the ehesten exactly.
We list at this place the most important points that one should take into account during the selection of an insurance now around not only one power-, but to be able to find also a price-oriented choice.
The less than 25-year long ones encounter numerous obstacles, as e.g. the small going-practice and the young driver's license, during the choice of an economical insurance.
Nevertheless, even if it was for an ideal insurance cover best to finish a full fully comprehensive insurance, there are more economical alternatives.
The cautious drivers can select one Vollkasko with deduction so that indeed the services of a full fully comprehensive insurance are covered, but they are offered for a low price.
This kind of contract contains that the customer must pay a part of the amount itself arisen from the damage.
The amount is defined before end of the contract and by means of the height of the insurance premium. This is more highly ever smaller the sum to be paid, Luis Nogüra, main representative of Spain, declares near ridge Europe, a mediation enterprise for online insurances.
Another option is not the enlarged insurance that insures the customer against external accident damages, however, against the harm arisen at the own car.
In addition this kind of the insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here a council.
If you are less than 25 years old, it suits in your hand to lower the insurance costs; so your credit increases itself when you attempt to go cautiously and to avoid accidents.
A credit is a lowering of the base rate near the corresponding assurance company.
In the opposite for this purpose a punishment paymentcontains an increase of said rate.
The height of credits and punishment payments depend from the society and those one profits.
If the enterprise has a profit-rich year behind itself, can be taken the liberty to increase the bonus-payments, Nogüra explains.
As soon as the 25-year brand is crossed, it is simpler for the drivers to sign a contract. Reason for that is the fact that with increasing going-practice the accident rate sinks.
Thus it is most reasonable to decide for a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction.
Usually the young people can not profit from their previous experience no, both in the case of an accident and at the moment of the driving not, explains that one Spanish chief of the European enterprise, and adds, that the majority of the accidents to happen in the second practice year after the fear of the beginner was put aside.
Nevertheless it is with a married customer who does not have any children more advisable to finish a full fully comprehensive insurance; natural only then, if it also approves the financial situation of the corresponding person.
On the part of the insurers married couples with children are regarded as the customers with the least accident rate, and correspondingly low also their contribution payments turn out.
In This Case a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction would be (with an amount around the 300 euros) the best option. In the case that one received a high credit, an enlarged insurance that starts first to the third vehicle year is recommended.
You go more loosely in total and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to apply a higher contribution payment Luis Nogüra states.
For pensioners it is good to finish a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction (with an amount around the 150 euros), or an enlarged insurance which does not start before with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally one must observe that the selfinsurance is something very important not only, because it protects the driver against possible accident damages, but also, because it contains high costs that require it, that a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation is found.
