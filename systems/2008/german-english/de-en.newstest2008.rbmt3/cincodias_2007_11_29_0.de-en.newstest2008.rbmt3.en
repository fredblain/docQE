Does an Endjahres-Rally await the stock exchange? Disagreement with the experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just five weeks up to the annual account at the stock exchange the investors abrade themselves already the hands with regard to the coming Endjahres-Rally.
Nevertheless the experts can not create any securepredictions concerning that.
Banif believes that in that statistically considers the month of December at the stock exchange usually with a positive market trend goes around
Nonetheless it is not advisable, predictions short-term and to construct only on the basis of statistics. Particularly then not, when serious tensions to be taken determine the current market event
Although other experts approve one such a strong course rise in the last weeks of the year not, nevertheless these say that the stock market price is designated by that one givenly liquidity of the market and the market participants. These invest due to the lack secure common stock fund main in bond funds that is there to productive capital values strongly affected by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend.
Accordingly the stock exchange will rather show in opinion of these experts a course trend rather lateral, influenced from market fluctuations particularly because we can not estimate the scales of the possible drop of the interest rate of the US issuing bank yet, to take back an insecurity that one before all onto the climbed crude oil price and the danger of the rise of the inflation rate is.
Javier Barrio, chairperson of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees with it being a risky time to announce an imminent Markt-Rally.
The chances do not stand very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish share index Ibex already since his HÃ¶chstmarke on the 8th November of 15.945,7 points lost a value of 4 %.
But not all experts divide the same negative opinion.
According to opinion of Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the Bezuschussung of the pension fund traditional, carried out every year around this time could close the year successfully with almost 16.000 points.
Nevertheless the expert emphasizes that this year the things could develop something to themselves differently; particularly due to that already in the second December week, and accordingly directly after the bridge day to the day of the constitution, occurring Endjahres-Rally.
In the view of the analyst the price fluctuations would not influence the market trends.
According to assessment of Federico Olucha, analyst near the bank Inversis, the previous judgments for the market are on an almost technical level, which could result in a deviation from the index values that scales depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis being able soon to emerge.
The analyst trusts in these turning out positively.
During the selection of the values which are supposed to drive forward the Ibex to new maximums the analysts agree agreed to themselves.
Solana of Intermoney declares that this year it is up to the big values.
The expert would belong the two big banks and some immovable societies to the value-winners since the stream sector to the given time will be too expensive.
Meanwhile Federico Olucha of the bank Inversis assures that the rises will be accompanied in connection with the bank and industry sector.
If the Rally happens in fact, the immovable societies will profit by it.
The ACS was in the last months on catching course and we hope for other immovable societies as Ferrovial and FCC taking the same way, according to the expert.
With regard to the increased consumer behavior during Christmas Day the periodic consumption will determine the market event In the last year half.
On the other hand the expert believes that also the technologies will achieve positive sales results himself if they are represented on the Spanish market only in small number.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years December showed only in two cases sinking course courses.
When at the end of 2003 the technology-bubble burst, this led the stock exchange from their crisis and the up to now last real final year rallye initiated simultaneously.
This year in which the Ibex 35 caught up around 28,17 percent points December showed a course rise of 6,68 %.
Whether in 2008 the fifth profitable year becomes in consequence (the Ibex climbs since January around 8,36 %) and can show also an Endjahresrally will be proved.
