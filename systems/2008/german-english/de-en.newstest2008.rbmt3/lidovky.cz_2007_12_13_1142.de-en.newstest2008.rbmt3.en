Polívka came round his kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the quarrel around the brand"Kingdom of Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava he used indeed when first the denomination "Walachischer König", however a team had established the project in long-standing work around Tomás Harabis in cooperation with the actor.
Polívka did not participate today in the negotiations.
According to his attorney the thing in this way is probably not, however, ended and his mandator will presumably appeal.
"The quarrel goes around Mr Harabis and his team wanting to participate in the popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitically", attorney said after the negotiations Polívkas.
All put "kingdom" straight with the words "Of Walachisches" this actor and comedian in front of.
The same opinion also Harabis is.
"We have an almost ten year long work behind us.
Fund-raising and drafts of the activities", he said.
According to it the reason is quarrel aroundmoney.
"After years it struck them that the project is successful and that they could have also something of that.
You" want "to gain" our work "parasitically, he passed on.
Lucrative business
According to the court Polívka used the denomination "Walachischer König" for the first time in one of his telecasts.
In 1993 the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned it.
That was not associated, however, then with the intention to establish a fictitious kingdom.
Some years later Harabis came to the thought of distributing walachische passports.
A business and an entrepreneurial activity to which Harabis connected the foundation of the company then "Walachisches kingdom" formed out an originally funny action.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to the use of his name and his signature in the passports and offered their owners even reductions during the visit of his farm and his theater ideas.
Who will be on the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabis used only the bare idea which made public Polívka in the program "circus ring" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity Polívkas surely helped the project of the walachischen kingdom", the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project Harabis that would have dedicated to it intensely and his team are.
The cooperation of the today zerstrittenen parties lasted up to the year 2000, when Harabis organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, began themselves to accumulate the quarrels that culminated in the deduction "König Boleslavs I. chosenly up to the Sankt Nimmerleins day" between Polívka and Harabis.

The competition prepared by Harabis could bring clearness in the quarrel around the throne and half a princess.
A new king should follow from that.
It did not want to betray details and anappointment yet.
"We do not want to rush anything.
It should be something like that as the royal move inWalachei.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Also Mr Polívka can "enroll" himself at that quietly",Harabis added.
