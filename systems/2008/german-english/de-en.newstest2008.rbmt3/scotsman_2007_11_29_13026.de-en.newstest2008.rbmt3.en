The climate on the Venus could give the future of the earth a view let
The Venus was maybe once a pleasant place for the life, scientists said yesterday.
Data of a European spaceship contained on an orbit show that the planet resembles an averted twin of the earth still more than was up to now conscious.
The Venus is the n√§heste planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have the same size approximately and have similar orbits of a planet, however, the Venus of the sun is a little nearer.
Before billions of years would have been there on the Venus' conditions, that would have been very similar to those ones on the earth and would have even habitable can be, scientists believe today.
But because of the unmoderated carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the Venus broke a very different development course to the erosion of the atmosphere through solar radiation and a slower rotation speed.
Today the planet of water is robbed and a surface temperature that is hot enough has to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and flash storms.
The findings of the space probe of Venus Express of the European space travel agency that examined the Planten for a year offer a sobering look on that, as the earth in the face of the catastrophic climate changes' could develop.
Professor Fred Taylor of the department physics at the Oxford university, one of the conductors of the Venus express mission, said: Realizes why the climate is so different on the Venus to that of the earth while the planets are being quite similar otherwise."
"Our new data it facilitates, to construct a scenario in which the Venus began before billions of years as the earth, possibly with one habitable environment."
