Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate subjects both the sceptics of the climate change and those ones that put a social and political debate into the foreground concerning that of a merciless criticism, the movement must put than whole a strong cohesion on the day.
Particularly if it is a question of a chief of the movement, which, as in the case of the government president Zapatero, the fight against the climate change for more important holds than the abatement of the Islamic terrorism and even suggests, to sign a new contract with the planet.
This proposal brings it, however, into declaration need concerning the action, and/or non-action of his government which contributed decisively to Spain standing within the EU at the top of the countries which fulfilled the handicaps of the Kioto-protocols most the least.
Who are the persons responsible for the non-fulfilment of the handicaps, to which sectors is this to be put down, and why did his government which had suggested the contract with the planet not stop this development.
In addition it is now forced, the Spanish citizens designated that one from it measures against the climate change without explaining Umschweife.
Which companies will be affected by that, which behavior of the citizens is supposed to be changed, which individual and collective economy measures must be carried out and which economical consequences result from that.
More precisely said who must sacrifice himself and will pay himself for the rescue of the planet.
However, it has and none will give to suchdeclarations in future.
Just because it is a question of the Aufopfern and the paying foritself.
Because the measures which can really be used against the climate change are unpopular.
You are costs-rich, uncomfortable and alarming for the accounts of the companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent suggested by the PSOE appeared seenly choice-strategically so dangerous to Zapatero that he saw itself forced to take back the proposal again.
Correspondingly it is valid now, the planet with Nothing, to save therefore with pure propaganda and empty sayings without every real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet the else politicians, so suitable for choice campaigns, must talk neither, still accuse, still demand, follow the pretentious edition, however, instead of this, to decorate the meetings and to inspire with his gentleness and kindness other.
This can happen, however, only then if the contract does not differ from his nature virtual in that and does not pretend either accordingly that the bike becomes the only moving means in the future or we may refresh ourselves only with a fan.
