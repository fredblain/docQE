Nicaraguan court confirms twenty year long prison sentence for ex-presidents
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty year long prison sentence for the former president Arnold Alemán to whom he had been condemned in 2003 because of finance fraud at the level of 100 million dollars (almost 1,8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he had been released from the prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda near the nicaruanischen metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state finds out grating again is currently unclear according to the AP news agency.
According to the chairperson of the court of appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will depend now on the custody officials whether one makes Alemán sit out his punishment at home or whether it into the prison must.
A court proved that Alemán had moved money of the government regularly onto accounts of foreign companies in Panama four years ago.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts belonged in reality to his relatives and narrowest supporters.
Some of this money landed finally in a fund that Alemán for the financing of his election campaign 2001 had established.
