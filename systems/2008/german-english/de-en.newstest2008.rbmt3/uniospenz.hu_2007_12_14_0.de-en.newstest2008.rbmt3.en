Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As environmental minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings end on Tuesday, and the debate about the international climate-regime after 2012 is continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss about the timetable of Bali, in which the emission-reducing measures for the time after 2012, therefore after the Kyoto protocols, defined are.
Currently a vehement debate is in progress between industry and development countries.
The USA signaled already that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers, however, they would be ready to reduce the hothouse gas emissions around 25-40 percent to 2020 in comparison with 1990.
The other great question of the conference is whether the industrial countries are ready next to the reduction of the emissions the developing countries both financial, than to support also technologically.
Also an agreement about the support was achieved by developing countries.
The one subordinated to the Kyoto protocols adaptation fund is supposed to be administered by a 16-headed council, probable at the Globalen Umweltfazilität (GEF) of the UNO, as in the "Piac és profit" is to be looked up.
Hungary's six percent
The attempt of the EU to retain their role of the pioneer with global climate protection measures, and to achieve a new international agreement to 2009 supports environmental minister Gábor Fodor on behalf of Hungary.
The minister that becomes EU until in 2020 the hothouse gas emissions reduce around 20 % (measured by the values by 1990) declared independently of that whether the "Getting off after 2012" is achieved successfully, or not. The union would be even ready to support a 30-prozentige reduction soferne other great industrial countries of the world, and/or developing countries also ready are, their obligations according to strengths and to come later responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the aim of the states that had joined the Kyoto protocols in 1997 was a reduction only of 5,2 percent wohingegen the EU with theirs then 15 member states already for a minus of 8 % had obliged.
The handicap for Hungarians says reduction of the hothouse gas emissions around 6 % in comparison with the years 1985-87 - a handicap that will absolutely fill the country as in the press release of the environmental ministry is to be looked up.
The use is high on Bali - after all the long-term international climate-political agreement must be within two years ready, otherwise it would come into force with security first after 2012. In This Case no renewed, international emission reduction system would follow the reduction projects defined in the Kyoto protocols, whose importance also the IPCC has emphasized, the scientific climate change committee of the UNO in his recent report international, honored with the Nobel peace prize.
Through that the emission reduction would be delayed, and the rise of the average temperature of the earth around more that would result extremely fatal and irreparable consequences in the consequence according to Wissenschaftern than 2°C would be unavoidable.
