New apprehensions above natural gas quarrel between Russia and Ukraine
A new price quarrel smolders between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the danger that Russian exports of combustible are influenced to Western Europe.
The biggest part of the Russian natural gas exports into the European Union (EU) is led through Ukraine and every quarrel between the two nations is observed very exactly.
Kiev warned, that if Moscow increases the price that it must pay for the natural gas, it of Russia higher transit fees into account will put.
A former conflict between the two states in the last year reduced deliveries into the EU-states.
The recent quarrel between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time at which the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom attempt to achieve an agreement how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in the year 2008.
According to Gazprom more must be charged Ukraine since the company group arranged up to 50 % to pay for natural gas from the neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine must pay 40 % more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states at conversations", the economic minister of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh the news agency of Reuters said.
"The natural gas prices changing themselves should be combined beyond doubt with our arguments concerning the height of the transit fees [to Western Europe] about Ukraine."
In the last great natural gas quarrel between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 Gazprom shortened deliveries into Ukraine.
This led to consequence for a case of the exports to Western Europe, which pushed up the prices drastically.
A quarter of the supply of the European Union forms Russian gas.
Russia has the worldwide greatest gas occurrences, but a lot of that remains underdeveloped.
The consequence is that Gazprom complements his own inventory with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
