In the Budaoerser commercial triangle the "Napi" increased around 16 percent the price of the usual Christmas basket also this year, however in all hypermarkets increases in prices of more than 1.000 HOOF were registered.
After the prices "galloped off" in the food markets in last December, the price increase did not turn out prozentuell drastically, compared with the anyhow high, former initial level.
However works determined it onto the consumers quenching, that which they had paid HUF for in the last year still far under 9.000 of this year even for 10.000 is available TO HUF.
The price of the "Napi" Market basket crossed the magic one 10. 000-HOOVES-HUF Borders around at least 91 in the examined markets.
The highest price was 10.573 HOOF.
(In 6800 the price suited TO HUF at 6.800.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish almost remained on previous year level, strong on the other hand the prices for turkey hen breast fillets, nut and poppy have climbed.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungarians, at Auchan there was 1 kg bread loaf, however, for 139 forint.
It did not give up with the product any collapse ofprices due to competition less than 200 forint.
Also the price of one was surprising here two liters of Coca-Cola returnable bottle of less than 200 forint, thus the drink cost HUF including pledge only in 257.
Nevertheless Auchan at the most expensive, and Cora at the most favorable cut off this year in the "Napi" Market basket comparison.
Our calculations made, that Cora the prices in the "Napi" Market basket opposite the Christmas prices in the last year at 15, while Tesco and Auchan were increasing each about 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the heurigen year was 12 %, during the rise between cheapest market basket of the last year and formed most expensive the current year's 21 %.
The average price climb was 1.480,00 HOOF.
The average increase in prices was still enclosed in the previous year 1.206,00 forint, however, the value added tax increase became noticeable with the prices of too last Christmas.
Exactly this process found the trade badly: Seemingly the department stores could not decide so right which price margin they are supposed to use with the single articles since the effects of the increase in prices on the consumer behavior were unpredictable.
(If the trader plans the rotation speed of a product badly, it can fall around essential profits in the price margin that follows the traffic intensity.)
Mehwertsteuer-relatively the price increase of the "Napi" Market basket turned out in the last year so radically, that the most expensive basket crossed the value of 2006 about 1720 forint, wohingegen the difference in prices at the cheapest basket only 844 forint was.
This year such extremes were not observed, there the most expensive basket about 1.630,00 forint more cost, when in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price climb of 1.284,00 forint.
In the comparison of the two last Christmas seasons a catastrophic increase in prices was proved, the price of the daily consumption articles in the hypermarkets increased in little as 20 months around more than 30 percent.
(This in turn confirms not unconditional the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungarians: Near some basic foods the Statistical office found a more than 30-prozentige price increase in the period of 12 months.
So in about next to flour also near eggs.)
One flings a look, however, into the "Napi" Market basket, this shines at Latter almost impossible, since the price level of the product expensive already in the previous year did not go up around hardly more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously there are flour suppliers in a stronger position, as the Eilieferanten - after all they could shift the drastic increase in prices to the Multis.
In the golden commercial triangle the hypermarkets do not complain; People report constantly about good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers does not look at the prices anymore at all in the three department stores.
Great amounts are bought from everything, lasting foods go in palettes above the counters.
Wednesday morning there were in all three department stores endless snakes with the cash when suddenly the number of the customers exploded.
However, a smaller customer frequency is told by the country so that many Multis complain with the pollsters, they could not achieve even the planned turnover, and indeed not only with foods, but also near lasting consumer goods.
