Klaus: Debates of the ecologists are unplausible
Global climate changes damage supposedly developing countries most themost.
President VÃ¡clav Klaus commented again on the problems of the global warming.
The criticism referred now to Bali onto the zu Ende gehende international conference of the UNO for the climate change.
In Vienna, where it presented his book "one bluer, no green planet", he exported that the debates of the ecologists are unplausible.
According to Klaus only the structure of the conference that forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of non-government organizations is not inacceptable but also the basic difference between the rhetoric that she accompanies, and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is some word fireworks that is only substitute for a real solution of current problems" said Klaus.
The Czech president stressed during the idea of his book that his topic is very important for it, and that he commits itself to that so therefore.
He expressed also his contentment with his book being published in German translation because "I often stumble on caricatures of my opinions."
Now prospective customers could gather hisattitude in a therefore undistorted way.
Klaus reminded of his not being a Klimatologe, but he has in his opinion sufficient conditions in order to write such a book.
It is finally to understand academics, capable, professional treatises and to judge, has experience with statistics and is also to nation business person.
He referred to the thesis as a main statement of the book, that the climate is changed continuously and that his changes are therefore normal, that there is not any matching opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not far too great and serious and thus did not represent any threat for the earth warming, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate, superfluous, ineffectively and in an inacceptable way are extensive.
In addition he considers it as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen, for unacceptable to impose unproved opinions on other ones, he regards that as a dangerous restriction of the freedom.
On questions of person presents he declared repeats, he is not against "a reasonable environmental protection, however against militant eco-activists that do not take any regard onto the relation between expenditure and profit."
Klaus had already two months ago in the Hayek-institute talked about the same topic in Vienna.
