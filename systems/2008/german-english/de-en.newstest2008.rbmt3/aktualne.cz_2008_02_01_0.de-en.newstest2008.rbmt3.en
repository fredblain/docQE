Fraudulent broker risked because of inferiority feelings billions
Bottomless swindler
So the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerní banka, describes his former Done Jerome Kerviel.
She lost indeed almost five billion euros because of it.
It does not seem, however, rather so that Kerviel was only a tall player that wanted to do it like his colleagues in addition surely incapable was.
For the difference to all big bank houses he recognized the crisis in time at the amerikanischenn mortgage market.
"It is psychologically rather weak", was to be heard from the mouth of his superiors that announced it near the police.
It a human being who had achieved profits at the end of last year with his businesses at the level of 1,6 billion euros was how, however, Kerviels which the French media, for example the daily paper Le Monde, published follows from the statements.
Crisis not only in America
"All which I wanted money was to be earned for my bank", he says in his statement.
In the summer he had succeeded in earning half a billion of euros just from the American crisis.
He had already indeed at the year beginning spotted the occasion forthis purpose.
In February there was already first news about so-called sub-prime-mortgages as they are given to income-weak customers or such which already formerly had installment problems turning out in trouble.
This crisis should not have influence on the whole economy, however.
Kerviel did not believe that and was right.
At the end of the year it had screwed his profit highlyup to 1,6 billion euros.
"Already than I the first half billion had earned, I did not know, as I that should not declare", Kerviel adds and passes on that it did not keep anything definitively for itself.
During the whole interrogation he admits that he forged documents so that one would not come him to the pulps.
He succeeded even in leading his heads behind the light even if the Eurex stock exchange was interested in his businesses by degrees.
Risk profit
Did he fear to fly up?
Presumably hardly.
"I thought, that they the simple fact, that I have earned for the bank 1,6 billion, satisfies."
From where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to acquire his position in a step by step way.
It came into the Société Générale in the year 2000, immediately after it had ended his study at the Lyons university, one.
His annual salary was about 51000 dollars.
After two years he was already assistant of a broker and in the year 2005 he became selfcontinuous broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Nevertheless he knew that he will never earn as much as other ones.
"Already at my first conversation in the year 2005 I knew that one observed me.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development", Kerviel declared the investigator.
But already soon to his entry the first great success came.
With the stocks of the alliance he earned a lot in his putting half a billion of euros on course losses of this title with the London bomb attacks.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
Solang du Gewinn make, we let to you
"That is as a snowball", he said to the policemen.
But the heads supposedly out of everything knew,and/or foresaw it.
"As long as I earned money, one closed the eyes."
However, then the great stroke came at the beginning this year.
On a single day he lost a billion euros.
At a weekend in the middle of January wanted to balance it that.
When he came to the work on Monday, he was already not anymoreemployees' of the bank.
And a few days later the bank announced that she lost five billion euros because of it.
And as came they it onto the pulps?
It looked suspicious through a vacation.
"I took only four days of the previous year.
A broker who does not take any vacation is one who does not want one to look to him into the cards", Kerviel said definitively.
