There are three groups of foreign buyers, Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgarien, says.
Those that want to sit down either revitalisierte immovables buy euro, or houses come down around 5-15.000 around 50-100.000 euro, that renovate it then themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication options are written in a large way, but also the proximity to a city, businesses and doctors are decisive for the buyers.
Those appertain to the second category, who are in search of a vacation residence (Bulgaria was listed in December under the top Ten Urlaubszielen of the Germans).
Businessmen define the third group, that with the objective of one middle- to long-term accretion invest.
Meanwhile immovables in the capital become constantly more expensive, necessitated by the always wachsende demand.

The price increase with the immovable prices exceeds the increase of the salaries by far.
