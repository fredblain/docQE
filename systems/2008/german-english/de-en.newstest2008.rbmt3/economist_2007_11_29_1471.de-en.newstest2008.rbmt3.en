Card sharks
Does the credit crisis of Americas infectKreditkartenmarkt?
If blood is in the water, it is is only natural, that dorsal fins spin annoyed.
Now where Americas' property market kränkelt, the predators have the credit card market of the country in the visor.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs reckon that the credit card losses could reach 99 billion dollars if the danger of infection of unterfinanzierten credits onto other forms of verb smoking credits spreads.
Signs of the strain are clearly visible.
There are rises both at the Ausbuchungen and with the delay rates which measure the part of the credits which are not too late in each case in a retractable way or more than 30 days.
The HSBC announced in the last month that it took one to 1,4 billion dollars fee elevation from their American consumer financing partial because of the weakness of credit card takers.
Nevertheless it is too early in order to sink into panic.
Losses and delays are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody the Drittquartals-Säumnissrate of 3.89% was almost a full percent point under the historical average.
The deterioration with the rates can be explained partially by technical factors.
A change in the American private insolvency right laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case from bankruptcy registration that form in turn for a big part of the Keditkartenverluste; the number of the registration (and in this way delay fees) would go up again, whether the general conditions for applicants for the credit worsen or not.

The card exhibitors look, however, at the money river instead of onto capital values, therefore falling house prices do not activate of necessity a change in the creditworthiness of the applicant for the credit.
You can be even for the card exhibitors of advantage.
The stimuli for consumers, to keep on paying the mortgage rates, sink if the immovables are less value than the value of the loan; as a result the card debts become more important under the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors can react to the stormier conditions also much more quickly and more flexibly as credit grantors when they change interest rates or credit borders.
That should reduce theoretically the risk of a fast re-evaluation of the capital values.
"We will not wake up one day and completely revalue the loans", Gary Perlin, Capital Ones main finance speaker, says.
Even if a sudden shortage crisis is improbable in the credit card market, the risks of a lasting downturn are considerably more real.
If lower house prices and a credit decrease America are urgent into the recession, the industry will stand beyond doubt a grimmer future ago.
They keep on holding look-out to these shark fins.
