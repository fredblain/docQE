Budget is through
Yes, it is created.
The national budget is approved of.
What is special one at this budget?
It is the first budget which this government projected, and which was accepted without support of the opposition through the coalition majority.
The for the current year the SSD (Social democrats) was still approved of with support because minister Sobotka had presented it (of this party), and the SSD could not allow it therefore to refuse it.
Unlike the lively debate in front of the vote about the motion of no confindence against the government nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliament approved of this traditionally few paid attention to, nevertheless highly important law calmly.
That is in a way paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the single chapters and posts of the budget, whether one likes that or not.
The budget is an essential component of the politics, is concealed, however, by the power fight of the government and the opposition.
That is a more thankful topic for the media, and therefore they dedicate more attention to it.
A quarrel among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober numbers are.
The national budgets suffered from three weak points that the budget can not remove for the year 2008 at the same time near the last social-democratic governments:
The first is the high part of editions, that are of because of law obliging, at which it is not a question only of the pensions, but also around social expenditures which the "silent" coalition of SSD and KSM (Communists) in the last year in front of the choices decided on.
The second is the defizitäre budget policy as a consequence of the first weak point.
The third restriction consists in the deficits of the public finances, that is the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and eingermassen under control.
A true time bomb is, however, the budget deficit of themunicipalities.
Many mayors often distributed debentures through which their city halls caused it in the excess in order to develop further sources from taxes, deliveries and bank loans except for gains for investments without careful consideration.
In the last years they succeeded in it, these debts through massive sale of stocks the Energy- and other supply networks' that they had received in the course of the denationalization of the state pay off.
Now this source already versiegt.
As far as we stick only to official and nachprüfbare facts, we find, that:
our economy already since some years, as the rest of the world, a growth phase which the SSD incessantly boasts about ran through.
That represented a unique possibility for their governments to sort out the public finances.
Instead of this these governments got into debt the state, however,still more.
Other countries, foreseen from a few exceptions as Hungarians, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more reasonable than our republic.
That is a giant disgrace which is mainly to be ascribed to the former governments.
We belong to the countries which are threatened, seen, least from poverty in the global standard.
Therefore no nassiven social programs which were blown up unfortunately just in the last years very superfluously in gigantic scale are necessary.
Even if has succeeded in deleting a part of the senseless populistischen editions that were adopted this year in front of the choices, is clear, that if it does not come in next time for a shift of the pension entry age and for a pension reform, then virtually any politics in this country, and, very now who is at the power ends, he will not have anything as a pure administration.
It is only easily exaggerated if one says that officials that divide up the biggest part of the tax yields mechanically on pensions and social expenditures become then from ruling politicians.
Therefore the this year's budget can not be a revolution, but it can stop only the displacement of normal editions through duty editions.
That for 2008 designated deficit of 70 billion crowns would be absolutely superfluous, if former governments had not distributed in the last ten years, which only worked.
If we do not want pure administration officials to become from ruling politicians that in fact it results in that, we must be patient then and this coalition government not far too strong, that it is conscious of that that the state can issue only as much as it is to charm in the situation at taxes and fees rest during the preparation of further reform laws want.
Only these facilitate a step-by-step enforcement of a harmonious national budget.
