Buses return fugitives to the work - and in order to fightAl-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi fugitives from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of marketed ones whose resources or Visas ran out, and other ones who hoped for the city to normality returning.
Some had even come back around the rebels combat, that had marketed it from their houses.
At the bus station Mansour, still before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen of penalties, that one was active to Terminal with fugitives from Syria and Jordan that had returned in private transportation.
"I decided on going to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad", Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a sunnitischer doctor, said.
"I came today back, because of what I saw on televison and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and as it would be now secure."
You say that the Mahdi-army stopped killing people", he said, with respect to the Schiitenmilizen of the militant clergyman Moqtada Al-Sadr who ordered to put his strengths to the present time back.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year old schiitischer teacher from the predominant one sunnitische part of Amariyah, with his two children turned, because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqi to work.
His schiitischen neighbors in Amariyah appealed to him in order to say to him that a militia local, supported by the USA helped to drive out Al-Qaida of their bastion in the west of the capital, and insisted it for the return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a sunnitischen and schiitischen tribe who had been driven out of his house by an attack with grenades in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad after who having been called his fellow citizens for the abatement Al-Qaidas.
He was to come back in order to fight.
"Two days ago some of my friends called me and said to me, that they began one the Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and that of my boys.
That is why I returned today", Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62, said.
Many told, that they had been attracted through the increasing rest in the capital since the US troop increase and the growth of local "groups affected citizen", which one arms and defend their quarters in collaboration with the American military.
However more spoke of that, to have been forced home through visa problems and versiegender resources in Damascus, where more than 1,3 million Iraqis had fled in the last years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year old three times father, expressed to force the general suspicion among the Exilanten that Nouri al-Maliki, the schiitische Prime Minister, had requested of the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions for the fugitives, around people for the return.
More than two and a half millions of people fled presumably from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We were fine until al-Maliki Syria visited and" it said "the government was urgent not to give the Iraqis any visas more in order to force her for the return into Iraq" the sunnitischen pensioners'.
"I can not trust a government that supports the criminals, that my house burned down, after I went away."
A part of the reason for the drop of the power is that Sunniten were driven out of schiitischen residential areas, where tensions decreased, and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places.
