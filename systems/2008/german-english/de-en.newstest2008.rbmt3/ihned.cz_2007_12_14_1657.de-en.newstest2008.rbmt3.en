The National Debts of the Czech Republic increased until end of September to 842,7 billion crowns.
Within the first nine months of this year they climbed accordingly around 40,2 billion.
Since June they sank, however, around 13,4 billion.
The Exchequer confirmed his information over the national debts of beginning of October with that.
A fault of 84000 crowns is allotted to every Czech.
Over the entire last year the state got into debt around more than 111 Miliarden crowns.
"Until now it shines, that we will not cross the border of a trillion crowns possibly thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year before in the year 2009.
Next year the debts should "move" between 900 billion and a trillion crowns", David Marek, analyst of the Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz, said.
Vladim√≠r Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance, sees it similar: "We could come to the transgression of a trillion in the course of the year 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If it should be shown that the situation is changed on the political stage, and should be ready more save, that could last up to the year 2010.
But I do not take such a change as a basis", he noticed.
Debts increase
The national debt stems from the debts of the state government and comes particularly from the accumulation of deficits of the national budget.
The national debt is financed through treasury bills, state debentures, direct loans or for example through loans of the European Investment Bank.
The domestic state indebtedness increased this year to 719,4 billion crowns in the meantime.
The foreign liabilities of the state increased in the meantime to 123,3 billion around 1,7 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable national debt reached at the end of September 803,3 billion crowns and sank since June around 13,7 billion.
The average maturity of the national debts|publicdebts climbed 6,5 years.
"The total fault increased over the year up to the third quarter from the first around 13 percent, which in fact is a lot faced with that how things go for the economy well.
It is interesting that the growth particularly with the debentures, where the increase is 20 percent, is to be noted.
Pikora commented, "it is bad that the debts increase, but on the other hand this already shows that one can undertake something before the pension reform comes", the data.
Better than expected
It follows from the financing strategy and the contact with the national debts for 2007 that the government had intended for this year to incorporate 159,2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan, however, thanks to the better development of the state beating hold politics on 152,8 billion crowns.
This amount stems particularly from the state budget deficit that will reach 76 billion crowns obviously this year instead of the estimated 91,3 billion.
It keeps on being a question of maximally planned means for the consolidation agency at the level of 13,3 billion crowns, a ten billion reserve for the payment of the pensions, the financing of state debentures for 43 billion and around rates for the loans near the European Investment Bank at the level of 1,8 billion.
