Popular will have opened his 200 credit institutions of on Mondays until on Fridays for 12 hours on day.
Popular decided on modernizing a big part ofhis branches.
In in total 200 of them are settled in the economy-strongest regions of Spain.
For the institute which operates under the brand name Popular Max these subsidiaries mean a big milestone.
However also for the remaining Spanish institutes, since Popular represents as a first bank consortium the jump, to extend on weekdays to 20.30h and to apply from 10h on Saturdays to 20.30h the opening times of his branches dares.
The bank consortium BBVA, who repeats also the prolongation of their opening times in the subsidiaries announce lies, did not take up to now yet any definitive decision.
The at the time of current negotiations of the bank with the trade unions to seem to aim at an agreement in the case of which 75 % of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for that on a weekday in the afternoon when neither for the custom.
Whether further banks follow the new initiative which adapts itself to the business opening times will depend on the empirical values of the Popular Bank.
And just that is also the intention that Popular withtheir project hunts.
It is objective to prolong the opening times of those branches which can capture the custom of independent, small and located centrally enterprises inclined to buy, but also the one of big department stores due to their situation.
The bank would like to open the new 200 branches in the course of the coming 18 months, there it not around new, but changed opening times sells.
For that the bank will reshape the premises of those subsidiaries which are already in business zones, and they adjust to the individual customer profile of the different zones simultaneously.
So the enlargement of the opening times is joined with a new room organization of the branches which is characterized by a more current, more colorful design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require any greater investments, but it would be accompanied by an increased personnel attitude since a branch needed now no more six, but eight or nine employees.
The subsidiaries which will be endowed even with additional premises for the KMU will not sell any financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular already at nine branches in Madrid tested hisdraft.
And the empirical values turned out positively, according to ÁngelRivero.
The subsidiaries of the streets bravo Murillo, O´Donell and the grain Vía were selected for that, which seems a clever decision to have been.
Popular currently guides approx. 2500 subsidiaries.
And wider 60 that operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized onto immigrants and point also enlarged opening times on, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax the model is not used the BBVA since most of them will offer a wide selection instead of this at non financial service services for the sale.
We would not like to represent any competition for our customers, Rivero declares.
With Telefonica they came temporarily to sell mobile telephones with the aid of external bank personnel for the agreement.
