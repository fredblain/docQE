High days are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary holidays are controlled so that the practice of the planning of the working days established itself in the meantime around the holidays, however, given by law exactly us the coming year little such days.
Also in the EU and in America one means something different by"holiday".
The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and work-free days.
Work-Free Days are mostly ecclesiastical holidays, or are related with significant historical events.
We celebrate for example also New Year: Both the last day of the old one, as also the first day of the new year work-free days are - latter alone to be able to rest already with that the New Year's Eve revelers.
In the whole year we have in total fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are the 15th March to remind of the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd October, the commemoration day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20th August the state foundation is celebrated on 1st May the work, at the 1st and 2nd November we commemorate our dead woman.
In addition there are each two holidays to Easters, Whitsun, andChristmas.
There ours State-, National- or religious holidays rare on a weekend fall, the practice of the "working day shift" persisted in the cases in which we would work before or after the holiday only a day.
The price of the prolonged weekends is, however, that we very presumably work on the Saturdays in front of that, or must go into the school.
When this day, that before or after the holiday falls, final is supposed to be worked off, is defined since long years by the work minister in an own regulation.
The right regulation is valid for all work donor and taker, for public employees and officials of the public service equally.
Only companies and facilities are excluded, in which the company without interruption is carried on, therefore also on the holidays.
The working regulations are only still brought to wage a little messily by the holidays at the end of the year: From the 24th December the life conks out in these parts ceremonially since most take time balancing, or the vacation especially picked up for that for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve.
In the next year more holidays fall into the week middle, and/or onto the end of the week so that there will be less rescheduling at the working days than this year.
The calendar is put first on the head around the day of the work so that the people can remain four days now at the piece at home.
Saturday, the 26th April becomes a working day, in this way the Friday, 2nd May a rest day can be.
The second rescheduling is associated with the holiday on 23rd October: On Saturday, which 18th October becomes one the Friday, to have to work off 24th October first of all.
The end of the year will completely stand, however, in the sign of the holidays after from the 24th December it remains to lie everything and to stand even if New Year's Eve fells on a Wednesday.
