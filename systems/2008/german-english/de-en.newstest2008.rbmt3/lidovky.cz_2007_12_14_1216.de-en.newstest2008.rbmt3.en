Banks want to overcome crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided on fighting against the crisis together on the financial markets.
So more than 100 billion dollars will reach by means of auctions onto the currency markets.
On these auctions the banks interest rates auction, to which they are ready to lend money mutually.
For example the American Fed sends 40 billion dollars on auction, wider she forks out 24 for the European one and the Swiss central bank.
It is after the assaults of the 11.September the first time that the central banks of the single states agree on a so coordinated procedure to the defense and/or Abmilderung of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is supposed to remove the greatest difficulties of the economy, therefore" Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote "the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can lend" in a report for his customers.
"The probability of a recession reduced the coordinated action of the central banks in the USA of 65 % on about 50 %", Baumohl added in his report.
The banks lost because of not operated credits already around 60 billion dollars, particularly in the United States.
Analysts expect even further billion losses.
"This central banks must have been afraid of what still everything can follow when decided on this procedure real" the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies, said.
"It looks like this that the situation is in fact bad" he passed on.
The central banks have the apprehension that if the banks themselves have access to loans heavily, to become also more expensive for their customers credits.
That would reduce the consumption and to fling the American economy into a recession, possibly with effects on the economic growth on the whole world.
The central banks decided to that after their not having succeeded in it on lowering the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate that is used with the money rental company between banks.
That means that the banks were afraid continuously to lend money mutually, and that although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the fall had lowered their interest rates repeatedly.
"That will have the same effect as a further drawdown of the interest rates", Greg Salvaggio of tense said to consulting of the agency of Reuters.
Some analysts think that this step of the central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem and indeed the case of the property market in the USA.
