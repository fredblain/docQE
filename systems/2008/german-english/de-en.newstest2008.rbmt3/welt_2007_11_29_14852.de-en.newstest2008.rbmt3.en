The fathers of the cabbage skirt return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies plays music again: The three volume members of Harmonia planned their consoles once again at a concert in Berlin.
To the Revival a monitoring appears from their large time"Live in 1974".
Already then it was abroad considerably more famous.
The arranged sensation happens then in the form of three set gentlemen at the evening board.
Everyone has his box in front of themselves,his cables and particularly his buttons.
Dieter Möbius thrones in the blossom-white shirt with 63 years inthe middle.
To the left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in the possession of laptop and guitar.
To the right, considered from the auditory, bends Hans-Joachim Rödelius, 73, concentrated at the console.
Everyone contributes noises, sometimes even a Beat.
And sometimes it matches by mistake to a traditionalpiece of music.
That seems not to disturb also the gentlemen themselves then in a largeway.
That the band Harmonia plays music again worried among cabbage skirt lovers for some excitement.
At what here may reveal: Purposeful demands did not show that the name buzzed indeed through the collective pop memory, however, by no means so lastingly in order to miss this band painfully since 32 years.
But why is also the German not supposed to be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the Siebziger years?
Especially as what is called Krautrock misleadingly was valid always more in England and America than in the own country.
When the music economy awarded the survivors of the group of Can 2003 of Cologne with the reverberation-price for the life's work, one looked in the hall into asking German pop faces.
As the Red Hot chili Peppers in the eulogy also still near the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! thanked, the amazement did not know any borders.
In the case of concerts Michael Rother sat later with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage as an old pal.
The problem of the ignorance at home and the transfiguration abroad isone.
The memory is already therefore overtaxed because the trio existed only two years and unfolded also a far smaller effect power in this time than they subsequently were assigned to by other with Harmonia.
Möbius and Rödelius had played music already before with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the name cluster promising a lot.
First of all one played in the cellar under the Berlinshow stage.
After that in Düsseldorf, for economical reasons for a plate label maintained by the church.
Rother had helped out shortly near power station and connecting oneself as a guitarist at Neu!, the then maybe most radical German group, a call erspielt.
Around 1973 Rother followed, however, the cluster-musicians into the exile after forest in the Weser mountain country.
There, in the Old Weser yard, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as city-fugitive Kommunarden.
Less ideological than in the commune I, where Rödelius was still allowed to take pains as a nurse.
Rather in spitzweghaftem artist existence.
Also a pennon of the song association Harmonia Ottenstein was found alleged in the bulky waste and for the art a name.
Some held Harmonia of that.
"Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe" was called thefirst album.
Because so calmly and modestly the music also rang, the band suffered from material need.
The brushwood compiling was not used only for the Selbstfindung.
The now appeared CD "Live in 1974" was logged at a concert in Griessem, before a just 50-headed record scenery, how anyone to remember believes.
The wish came of Rother then, Harmonia to force and to practice sometimes.
For Rödelius and Möbius an immoral demand.
The band explained in 1975 their separation.

Cluster was livened up in the eighties again and is since then more successful than it was Harmonia ever.
The Griessemer live album is to be owed to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His Greenland record company set itself to maintain the cabbage skirt as an ureigenen German contribution to the live music the aim.
New! was dug up in this case already as Rödelius solowork.
The physical reactivation of Harmonia occurs in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world.

Julian Cope is there, the Briton, old punk and author of the manual "Cabbage skirt sampler".
There also the Loveparade-inventor is Dr. Motte.
With what the entire bandwidth of the influences of the cabbage skirt on the following pop music would be outlined.
The vacancy of the supergroup is filled by Harmonia in this case.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most peculiar Sounds in the hall: "The only music preserves, the future belongs to it."
There are pictures which show the producer with Harmonia in thefarmhouse room.
Projections of further black and white photos of confusedly wired rigs are used for the putting end education.
Before that the three veterans are dealt again with the improvisation.
No more, when they stick microphones to the organ and to the percussion in order to elicit incredible clays from the instruments about self made effect devices.
Today the electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into the Technical hollow Tüftler.
Also the choir of the house does not change anything atthat.
Under the management Barbara Morgensterns coughs under Soundwolken and whispered and at a beautiful place with emphasis "Aaaaaaaah!" sung.
Krautrock was really always a very English concept.
It was a question never of Rock.
The roots were searched less in the blues, than in colleges of music (Can), technologies (Power station) or on the flight in front of artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here "'68!" calls, does not have very improperly, and Harmonia can not be brought from that also now from the rest.
Still the most natural thing is reconsidered on the stage thoroughly.
Where does music begin and when does it stop?
That can rob one of the nerves or give to fleeting moments of great luck.
