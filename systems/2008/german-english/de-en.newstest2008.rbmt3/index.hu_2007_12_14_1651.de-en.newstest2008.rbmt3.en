In many places disinfectants are economized on
Became wage more than a thousand infections in hospitals that were to be put down to an inappropriate contact with antibiotics registers.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of the personnel - everything factors, that the embankment of the infections not just zuträglich are, so the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places people save also near the disinfectants.
In the traumatology-department of the János hospital a MRSA-infection was diagnosed recently.
The bacterium resistant against antibiotics was found in a masculine patient who was hospitalized after a hard accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was here already a similar infection.
The injured person of a hard car accident was released from the hospital, little later the man had to return, however, with a MRSA-infection. An important operation could not be carried out since then because of the bacterium which is still in the body of the patient yet.
Until 10th December of this year 1094 infections activated by multiresistant exciters onto the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System were announced from hospitals, according to the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many, infections activated by multiresistant exciters were registered in the hospitals therefore with security, the darkness digit might be, however, higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were activated to that from the MRSA against Methicillin-Oxacillin of resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium bears about a third of the people in their nose without its causing an illness.
SA-conditional infections (as about inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) react mostly well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
The means are proportioned, however, too highly or used inappropriately, arise from the well respondierenden bacteria antibiotics-resistant, that expand quickly under corresponding conditions in the hospitals.
In particular with patients with immune system weakened, or functioning badly permanently, however also in older, or patients with small body weight can these bacteria difficult infections, as for instance wound infection or blood poisoning, that is sepsis, cause.
According to the medical conductor of the János hospital the MRSA-infection is not anything special, such incidents appertain to the sick person house everyday life.
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi - there are not MRSA only over there, where it is not searched.
Resistant against antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff bears rubber gloves and masks during the supply, and we have the antibiotics, necessary for the treatment," - so Tibor Nyulasi.
With their admission into the hospital the patients are examined indeed for MRSA, nevertheless an infection can always not be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of the infections activated by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, however, the conditions currently being there and circumstances are unfavorable for the embankment of the origin or the spreading of the multiresistant exciter, Karolina Böröcz says.
After this infection mainly occurs in hospitals and homes for the elderly, the taken patients should examine the hospitals and MRSA-infected immediately isolate.
In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not practised, however, so frequently.
Last but not least because it vonseiten the state health insurance no subsidies for this investigation gives.
Most cases would not come to light before then therefore if the patient has already a noticeable MRSA-infection, according to the medical head of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations for the corresponding application of antibiotics to Vonseiten of the European Union in the humane medicine, there are, however, guidelines also in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures.
Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be precise, that is, microbiological investigations are necessary so that no resistance to the means can form itself, however, this directive is not always kept by hospitals either.
Among the itinerant ones, or themselves in the basic supply of contained patient microbiological sampling are even even rarer, so Karolina Böröcz.
People save near the disinfectants
Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is transmitted on the other one by the nursing staff from a patient most frequently.
Just therefore the manual washing, or the carrying of gloves and masks are of a great importance, however, there are also on this field considerable shortcomings in the hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted through droplet infection or contact, in the domestic hospitals always the possibility to isolate the infected patient does not exist, however.
The rooms are even often full, the beds just at each other follow, although there should be a distance of at least 1,5 meters between them from epidemiological view.
As Karolina Böröcz keeps on saying, it happens unfortunately in the financially less well set hospitals even that near disinfectants saves there are few nurses, many patients - everything factors that almost favor the origin of infections.
Such infections are nachweislich far less frequent there, and/or the further circulation of the exciter, where these protective measures are kept to can be stopped, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Therefore agreeing with MRSA-infections into the grip causes enormous costs to the health insurances they are combated everywhere.
In England for example the prevention of MRSA, and/or their embankment was held in the government program.
According to first signs the program is successful - as published data prove, the tendency of the MRSA infections is regressive in England.
The European center for illness prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the origin of multiresistant exciters (under that also MRSA), as soon as the prevention of infections declares as one of his priorities in hospitals.
