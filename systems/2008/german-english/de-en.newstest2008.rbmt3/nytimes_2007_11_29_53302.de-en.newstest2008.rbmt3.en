Not very below in Moscow
The price of an airplane of the brand Gulfstream G550, endowed with a Rolls-Royce-engine and range enough in order to fly from Moscow non-stop to Los Angeles is near at least 54 million dollars.
But that is small change for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers place for up to 18 passengers", Dan Firer, a Gulfstream-representative, said.
"But no one of you asks for as many seats because it is for a private family or an enterprise president."
Firer was at the Gulfstreamstand on the last Friday during the millionaire exhibition, one four day's orgy of consumption set for the show that was organized in an encapsulated exhibition center at the outskirts of a town of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream more than 200 other luxury providers had built up booths, on that hoping, to interest again to money come Russians at everything, of mahogany-paneled yachts up to diamond-excessive selfcrickets that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer took cautiously a shining orangenen Porsche into the visor at the next booth.
"That is a beautiful car, but it is small change in comparison with us", he said.
"To the United States Russia is the second-largest market for private airplanes."
The Russian capital seems heated from an oil boom as floodedly with money as Dallas to his heydays does.
"We went through the same phase into the 1890ern, as if Amerikaner unites too gigantic fortune came and into crowds to Europe would go where they were regarded as materialistic" Mars resonance Goldman, a scientist, would say at the Davis center for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Harvard university.
As the Saudi-Arabian Überflieger of the 1970th and the Japanese in the 1990ern, the Russians protrude as the free money output units most visible in the world.
The most excluding luxury brands search theirpart at the gold drunkenness.
Elsewhere in Moscow in this week a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairperson of LVMH, put on in order ideas over how one can sell hochpreisige goods on markets as Russia to be exchanged.

"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - therefore we all are here, Nicole Marais, a sale and marketing representative of David Morris, told to a London jeweler".
She had gone to the fair for the first time together with the Russian trader of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplarily well-kept and the men are all property worth."
While they are pulling Sunday night into evening dress through the halls, two immovable brokers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, call 26, themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked after the cars and I attempt to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and Porsche", Ms Yumatova who delivered the designer clothing which supported it, as a Roter-Teppich-Veteran with Joan Rivers, said.
It seemed the fair in the first place to aim at the new-rich ones to stand the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers that would be ready several hours in the jam in order to go to a drafty warehouse that geschmachloserweise Cadillac of Escalades, jackknives of platinum, Mövenpick Eiskrem, tailor-made Billiardtische, flatlets in Dubai and Gund teddy bear next to each other set.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollar).
"The Russians are interested to learn at that which brand the most expensive and best is" said Mr Gijrath that at a booth of the Dutch Porcelain Manufacturer Royal Delft fit patriotically before a wall-large Imitat of a Rembrandt picture from hand-painted, blue tesseras.
"Russians are natural more at Klimper-Klimperinterests."
In Fact the traders say here, that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is according to Russian standards old) already of pretentious logos for the kind of sober brands with restricted numbers of items have moved, that would not commercialize themselves with a commercial show.
In spite of that several thousands of people pushed, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists every day through the halls.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday Roman Ershov said, the general manager of King Koil beds here, he would sell two 70.000 dollar mattress sets, produced from silk, Kaschmir and cotton, with gold threads sewn in.
Also in the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sale manager for A1 Moto, of a company said the High-End-Autos with High-End-Alarmsystemen equips, that his company sold the garish orangenen Porsche to a Russian millionaire for 170.000 dollars.
Up to the Sunday afternoon Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A, said. Connection, an enterprise that adjusts luxury cars onto customer requirements, he would have sold three car radiator grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom that resemble chain bracelets tied together with each other for each 55.000 dollars.
It showed a reporter a car tire which was developed for a Russian casino owner with spokes which it had cladded with colored Swarovski Kristallen so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The costs: 22.000 dollars for a four substitute.
"The Russian millionaire, the bunch leather wheels' or a picture of the face of his wife of cubic zirconium would like to have", will not "go" unconditional on these wheels", Mr Karapetian said.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40-cars' garage."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said the phrase "Russiche Millionäre" would currently not express a lot of exclusivity faced with the rise of the local immovable prices.
"If you three or four years ago have bought an apartment in Moscow, they are already presumably millionaire, at least on the paper, when already not in cash", he said.
"There are more of those ones than you believe."
Those ones, that no millionaires could be at least so to do as if they were rich at a state that was practiced from Alliance Continental, a Russian property administration enterprise.
The enterprise had set up four red telephone boxes according to British Model which were crammed with mountains of wrong million-Dollarscheinen.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the enterprise, said his employees would have printed 500.000 wrong bank notes for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped in order to throw around the money heaps, mobile telephone photos, while they are leaning back among the replacement fortune, to make be punched from friends, or simply past a few a million put in.
"See in Moscow everyone as a millionaire can feel", Mr Karryev said.
