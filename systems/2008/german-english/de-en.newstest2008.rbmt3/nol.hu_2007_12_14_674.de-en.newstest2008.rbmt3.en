Political Capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk
In the view of the department of risk analysis (Risk Analysing Division) of Political Capital the activities began the Hungarian's founded in this August with support of the "movement for a better Hungary" guard the risk Hungary's and the region's in several respect.
In the "risk warning report" of the institute it is called among other things: In Connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard the highest political risk sets the "sharpening of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary dar, that could lead to violent ethnic quarrels even at short notice".
Main reason for that is the strategy of the Hungarian guard which presumably aims at the provocation of such a quarrel, according to the research institute.
How tells looks this as a lapse on the part of the political persons responsible: "Persons of the public life left the discussion of the Roma-question with representatives of radical political grouping who now based their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian-contrast".
One presumes, that this the problem intensify, to make the reasonable dialog impossible, extremities favor as soon as the probability of violent quarrels would increase.
The Forschungsinsitut in addition thinks the activities of the Hungarian Guard would have last but not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad considerably damaged, in particular what "affects" the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity.
We remember: Since fall 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups is continuous in Hungary in the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several were founded, "national self-defense association" naming organizations.
"This grouping is common, that they call themselves as civilian organization in each case while they are boasting about that openly their members on - sometimes armed - defense tasks of preparing (Disaster protection, national defense, Ordnungshütung), under appointment on the unsuitability of the police, the army, and/or the state itself," called it.
And wider: That all happens according to that method, that one attempts to camouflage as middle class initiative attempts different, based onto the political and party moroseness of the population, political.
The stress of the civilian character and the association form are only not used therefore for the avoidance of juridical hurdles that could emerge in the course of the registration near court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As is to be understood from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard represent a risk-increasing factor also for the relationships with the neighboring states.
"In the last months the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighboring states as a potential safety hazard, some ultranationalistischer politician of certain neighbor countries sees in the origin of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of his own anti-Hungarian politics.
That all has effects on the political stability of the region -" it was called".
From the Viewpoint of the research institute the foundation of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in central-east-Europe, thus the political risk increased for the entire region.
As tells, the activities are comparable to the Hungarian guard with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation in August 2007 was announced of the right-extreme Bulgarian's National union (BNU).
In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian guard the Roma mass outrages which occurred in a quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana) stood.
The BNU took as an opportunity the incidents for the foundation of the National Guard now, with the argument that the objective of the organization is the "national protection".
In your opinion a regular "gypsy terror" was indeed perceptible in the last 17 years in Bulgaria, the state remained, however, idle and indifferent - so Political Capital.
And wider: The initiative would have kicked a vehement debate loosely in the Bulgarian public.
As saidly, the increased risk for ethnic quarrels is proved also by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard to resistance purposes.
There the activities of the Hungarian Guard up to now many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard shows, not to exclude it is, that the Hungarian Roma also, it means to react to the threats with the organizing of their own protection, in the risk warning report by Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director with Political Capital said on demand the news agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annually risk analysis reports would be published, and should be recognizable risk-changing tendencies, the public opinion is informed, as in the case through the publication of the risk warning-report.
