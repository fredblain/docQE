Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades of the crew of the International space station (EAT) will have needed more than seven hours in the space in order to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar thermal collector which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific works on the station.
A risky exit that achieved several records due to his duration, the distance of habitable modules, the quickness with which it was organized, and the tools made by the astronauts in order to carry on the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the space shuttle Discovery, a big cylindrical part that is supposed to include soon the European and Japanese scientific labs.
This module is a kind of pier for the module-labs.
But one must be able to supply it with stream.
It was the second task of the crew therefore to turn over a 17,5 tons heavy module for the electric power production above solar thermal collectors which was already on the ISS in order to bring it into his final position.
After she had moved it, the crew got down to the restructuring of the solar thermal collector of the module whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened, that one of the commutators that can be folded as accordions was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of approximately a meter
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the commutator anymore yet.
The astronauts who leave the space shuttle Discovery originally for a control walk and then should repair other solar thermal collector whose rotation system was faulty saw themselves forced to dedicate oneself to the damaged commutator.
And Scott Parazynski was selected, to stroll around at the end of the 30 meters long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to that of the station in order to carry out the repair.
He is one of the best Spacewalker (Wetraumg√§nger) of theNASA.
Large, resistant, very sent, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-jaehirige learned doctor was selected therefore, to operate on the hurt solar thermal collector.
After he had examined the damages exactly, it cut the faulty cable and attached a kind of rails on the damaged place.
He was supported by a second Spacewalker to stay near the sluice, and, of inside, of the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The astronauts had devised the tool which he used, a mini hockey stick, wrapped around with insulator in order to prevent an electric stroke on the solar thermal collectors which produce several hundreds of volts, on board the station and made the tool which he used, a mini hockey stick, wrapped around with insulator in order to prevent an electric stroke on the solar thermal collectors which several hundreds of volts produce.
When the action was ended, Scott Parazynski waited, until the commutator was completely folded, before he counted his tools and before he turned his tools back into the station.
Yesterday afternoon enjoyed the astronauts half a day of relaxation, before seven astronauts turned round today onto the space shuttle Discovery back in order probably to enter upon the moving-flight to the earth Wednesday.
