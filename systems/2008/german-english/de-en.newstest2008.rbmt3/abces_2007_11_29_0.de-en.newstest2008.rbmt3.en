Bono declares itself, the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo understood and, trap of a choice victory, to accept in the congress.
The former defense minister José Bono accepted the offer of the government president and secretary-general of the socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly he will lead the list of the PSOE candidates at the coming general choices in Toledo and, in the case of a choice victory of the socialists, the office of the congress president take over.
So it of José Blanco announced to organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono in the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero occurred today in the head office of the party.
In the view of the head of the government the offer is onto the former minister justified since it is important in the politics to be able to count on the best and is Bono among the best.
In addition the politician coming from the Mancha would run in the case of a victory for the socialists at the coming choices according to all appearance as a chairperson of the congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as a congress president. This had announced on the last 15th one November not to enter upon more at the next general choices, to end his career in the public politics and to support the climate protection instead of this in the on-campus field.
The former minister had to admit that the government president would have insisted on the political event continuously since his resignation two years ago onto his return.
Furthermore it referred to who would take over the post of the congress president in the case of a choice victory not wanting to withhold the party from the citizens, as with the appointment of the vice-president for economy, and referred to this as an act of the transparency.
If it should take over the office in fact, he hopes so the chamber into a house the respect's and not the insult's or the yelling's to convert in order to make her appear so increasingly more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately one gains from time to time the impression as if the single place in which one can not talk in Madrid quietly and calmly were the congress; so the government president was interrupted in the senate once up to 26 times.
Simultaneously he praised the current president Manuel Martín and his good work and pointed out, it does not want to raise the appearance to already have taken over the office since otherwise his political opponents would refer to this as arrogance.
