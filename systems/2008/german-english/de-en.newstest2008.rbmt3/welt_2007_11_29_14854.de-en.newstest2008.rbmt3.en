Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous peace" two films deal again with Balkan War.
Nevertheless both do not convince.
To set the drafts either to a lot on Action and Geballer or however they are too sentimental.
There also Richard Gere can not help in "The Hunting Party".
The good information first: Indeed the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic hide still in the mountains of the Balkans, however, calculated there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere was found now.
We had last lost the most beautiful man of the octogenarian years from the eyes because far too many nice-irrelevant roles cured one of the pleasure into feeling well motion-picture work for women and far too many press conferences on the topic Buddhism on seeing.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting party - When the hunter to the Is Hunted (why film titles must be today actually always so long and confused as train driver wage agreements must?) nevertheless maybe to look.
It supplies a representation eye-winking wonderfully: Basically his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become from Gere if the fate and the film branch were not so merciful: A man who has his very best times long behind himself, who, however, still preserved considerable residues of the former charm even as a ruin-same monument of his downfall.
But in spite of this trump "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Murderous peace", that starts also in this week, only the endless row of failed Balkan War films.
With "Murderous peace" one can do short process: The film acts from two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serb from kosovarischen snipers, on which one falls with them in love promptly also still.
Although it is acclaimable, that here once not the Serbs as an only root of all evil are represented, the fernsehflache film disappears far too quickly in Geballer and Action.
A kind remains "Alarm for Cobra 11" without motorway but for thatwith war.
On the other hand it can be investigated at "The Hunting Party" almost exemplarily why actually there has never yet been a correctly good Balkans war film.
The history of three US war reporters that prepare themselves in order to trace the Serbian upper war criminal "the fox" could have become maybe a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another scriptwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories resemble themselves really remarkably: To go both Male small teams into the forest, in order to achieve something, what the militaries not can and both Male it becomes a journey into the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is, that one of Simon Hunt not simple the cynic come down with heart be lets, when that it us at the beginning is imagined.
No, the script must impute on top of that still a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin to him.
Finally "The Hunting Party" goes then the creek under that, if the reporters succeed in what Nato, CIA and all head money hunters of the world in five years did not create within the last five minutes in the quick-motion procedure: The war criminal catch and to the Muslim Bosnians for the just revenge leave.
That is so bad that one would like to call the International court of justice in The Hague because of crimes against the cinema logic.
In this case the film has a most deeply human request.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic run still freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to be by way of exception once agreed) not to practice the pursuit far too intensely due to secret political agreements.
But the well-meant one and the evil are sometimes so similar themselves that a famous Brecht-Gedicht comes to one into the sense.
In that it is called above the wooden mask of an Asiatic demon on the workbench of the poet: "I see the swollen forehead veins compassionate, pointing out: hard how being bad is".
Films as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such a swelling-head that, however, pointing out is as hard, good to be.
The problem is not restricted on the genre of the Balkan Warfilm.
Is recent in this newspaper tells become, that all Iraq films Hollywoods were big flops.
One can add: There has never also yet been a good South Africafilm.
Almost always is valid: If a star hangs around on the crisis-breeding elements or mine fields of the world, something like that comes in this case then from that as "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all the conflicts are within a given time simply still toonear.
It had to pass by after all decades before to Hollywood with "Schindlers Liste" could shoot a good film about the holocaust.
Some film will presumably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" being regarded as classics now were not celebrated at that time really by any means as masterpieces unanimous.
But maybe we know today, where every mass murder in real time comes on now two screens at home, also simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the screenplay writers of the Bedenkenlosigkeit who needs it in order to tell good histories.
"Existence or nonexistence" or Really finally became "the tall dictator" as well also therefore because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet as in fact badly the Nazi regime was there.
Maybe one must not want to be good if one wants to make goodfilms.
Maybe one must have the sarkastisch distanzierten artist look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
As that to parallels between his historical novel "Lempri√®res dictionary" and Balkan War was questioned, he answered: "That is due only to some things being never changed.
Cities will be always terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in dreadful way and always there will be war in Yugoslavia."
