Budget is through
Yes, it is created. 
The country household is approved. 
What is special at this household? 
The first household that this government sketched, and that is supposed became without support of the opposition by the coalition majority. 
That for the running year was approved yet with support of that (social democrat) because it minister Sobotka (of this party) had produced, and that was not able to permit itself it therefore to reject it. 
In the difference to the lively debate before the voting over the mistrust proposal against the government, did nothing happen this time dramatic. 
The house of representatives approved noted this traditionally few, nevertheless highly significant laws in all quiet. 
That is to a certain extent paradoxical. 
All reigning does not begin and ends with the single chapters and post of the household whether one that pleases or. 
The household is an essential component of the politics, is covered however through the power struggle of the government and the opposition. 
That is for the media a more grateful subject, and therefore they dedicate more attention to it. 
A dispute under politicians is for the public much interesting as sober numbers. 
The country households suffered at the past social-democratic governments from three weak points, that the household cannot remove for the year 2008 all at once: 
The first is the high share of editions that are of law because of obligating, whereby it concerns not only the pensions, but rather also around social editions, that concluded the "tacit" coalition of and (communist) in the last year before the choices. 
The second is the budgetary policies in deficit as a consequence of the first weak point. 
The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the budgets deficits of the communities. 
The largest risk is not however the national budget deficit. 
This household is public and eingermaßen under inspection. 
A true time bomb is however the budget deficit of the communities. 
Many mayors issued in order to open further sources except receipts out of taxes, duties and bank credit for investments, often inconsiderately bonds, through that it its city halls in the excess of debt-ridden. 
In the last years, it succeeded them, these guilt through abundant sale of shares of the energy networks and of other provision networks, that had received it in the course of the denationalization of the country, off number. 
Now this source is already failed. 
As far as we comply only with official and verifiable facts, let's assess, that: 
Our economy already since some years, like the remainder of the world, a growth phase passes through, whose itself that without intermission praises. 
That represented a unique possibility for its governments to bring the public finances in order. 
Instead debt-ridden these governments the country however yet more. 
Other countries, apart from a couple of exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, much more sensibly managed than our republic. 
That is a giant shame that is to be attributed predominantly the earlier governments. 
We belong to the countries, that are threatened, in the global standard seen, at the least of poverty. 
Therefore no nassiven social programs are inflated became necessary, that unfortunately just in the last years very superfluously in gigantic size. 
Also if it is arrive to paint a part of the absurd populist editions, that were dismissed this year before the choices,, is clearly that if it does not come in next time to a postponement of the retirement age and to a pension reform, ends is practically each politics in this country, and, entire same who at the power, will remain it nothing as a pure administering. 
It only easily is exaggerated if one says, that then out of ruling politicians officials become, who divide the largest part of the tax collections mechanically on pensions and social editions. 
Therefore this year's household can be no revolution, but rather can command only the displacement of normal editions through duty editions restraint. 
That for 2008 planned deficits of 70 billion crowns would be thoroughly superfluously if earlier governments had not issued in the last ten years, what only went. 
If we do not want, that it comes really in addition, that out of ruling politicians pure administration officials become, we must be patient and am this not all too strong coalition government that deliberately is itself however its that the country can issue only so much to take in like he at taxes and fees in a position, wish quiet in the preparation of further reform laws. 
Only these enable one gradually execution of a balanced country household.
