Integration of slovak students at britschen schools does not succeed
At British schools, the number of children increases out of countries of Eastern Europe, what evokes in the domestic anxieties around the further development of the local school system. 
The integration of the east Europeans bumps until now into a row of hindrances. 
British schools assess even cases where disputes between the Zuwanderern and the children of the original inhabitants increase at violence. 
The problem with the integration of children out of Eastern Europe at britschen schools the case of North Kent illustrates appropriately where the discussions between the domestic and slovak Zuwanderern gradually increase themselves. 
Quarrellings, harassment and uper eggs under students transferred themselves to the relations between the parents. 
The situation already so far developed that the police in Chatham arrested a slovak woman, who had struck a ten-year boy with an iron pole. 
The accused defended itself therewith that the boy had insulted it with racist outrages. 
The police had to interfere also after an attack of these minor girls on a slovak Zuwanderer. 
The girls had made nominally racist comments vis-à-vis the man and had plastered it with stones. 
"As we home went, climbed a boy on a bus cottage and spat on us. 
When I said it, it should stop, plastered be described it with apples and pears and exposed then Gesäß," a mother of slovak students of the newspaper The Times a further unpleasant occurrence to us. 
Troubles come of both sides. 
One of the domestic designated the dispute with the Zuwanderern out of Eastern Europe even as a survival battle. 
The cited cases attest that the mood between domestic and Zuwanderern becomes more and more at British schools tenser. 
In Great Britain, 70000 Slowaken are reported, that came on working that which is sought here. 
About 30000 slovak students visit accordingly British schools.
