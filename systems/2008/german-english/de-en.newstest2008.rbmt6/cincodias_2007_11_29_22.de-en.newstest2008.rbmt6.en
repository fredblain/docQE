The Spanish private transmitter Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and overtakes therefore its rival Antena 3. 
have it
With this sentence, the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile announced, in stock exchange end its contentment. The transmitter led by it had raised its value by the dual of its rival Antena 3. 
An aspect however softened its joy: That is exactly what is injured me; that we a higher growth, but rather that we slighter losses it did not assess. 
It emphasized that they all too deeply sunk in spite of the weak market
Telecinco concluded yesterday the day with a plus of 2.54%. 
This profit decreases its previous this year's losses on 15.66%. 
The goodwill reaches according to Bloomberg now the 4,488.88 million Euro whereby Mediaset is controlled the head share of the capital (52%), and Vocento is involved only with 13%. 
The rival Antena 3 lost yesterday 1.52 points and has had for January a loss of altogether 40.5% to register so that its market value with 2,193.46 million amounts to itself on the half. 
The market values of other börsennotierten communication business on the other hand climbs; in the case of Sogecable on 3,571 million, in Prisa (publisher of the periodical Cinco Días) on 2,518.53 million and in Vocento on 1,779 million. 
That compare to lets derive Antena 3 itself from the fact that it itself two similar business so Vasile. 
Uncertain yet the question appears act can, to which extent we actually stock exchange technical, to which price and like we it can form on customer plain lucrative. 
Telecinco explained be a week ago intention to climb this year to the first television station with more than 1000 million gross profits out of advertising revenues. This assured Guiseppe Tringali, the manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the Werbeunternehmen of the group. 
If the intention should be transferred, the transmitter its Werbeeinkünfte would increase in comparison with the 965.4 million out of the preceding year around 3.6%. 
In the case of Antena 3, the net revenue climbed around 1.6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million) while the net incomes were able to show only a climb of 0.7% (630.4 million out of the TV business). 
The analysts see the head factor for the stock exchange course better in the comparison by Telecinco in the high Payout-Ratio, that the firm was able to show to the present moment: The business led by Alejandro Echevarría caused 2006 a 100-percent dividend fallout. 
Vasile assures however that the Ratio yet could vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a mother company,, also if it is yet too early for an official announcement. 
Are the official compromise obligated to pay at least 50% of the shares even if we indicated previously always substantially more. 
I hope that we can content our stockholders this year, whose share value we already were able to increase through the purchase of 33% of the Endemol-shares. 
After statements of the analysts, the market shows currently certain loss tendencies. 
Lehmann Brothers reduced first recently its profit calculation in Telecinco for this year around 4% and for 2009 around 7%. 
Let this be the consequence of the abridgment of the presumable rate of increase that will be due 2008 of 10.5% to 8.4% and 2009 of 5.5% on 5.1%. 
This reduced also the presumable profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 around 4.5% and for 2009 around 7.5%. 
3 options. 
1. 
Ibersecurities: sets on its high effective yields and be persistent potential and recommends therefore the purchase of both shares. 
2. 
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buy) measures a more advantageous position as a result of that and the prospering market in than an Antena 3 (hold). 
3. 
JPMorgan: recommends to put back the expectations in both cases in view of that (satiated market and worse economy climate)
