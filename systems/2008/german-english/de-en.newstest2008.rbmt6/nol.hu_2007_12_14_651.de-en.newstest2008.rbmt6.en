Festival days are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays legally exactly are regulated so that the practice of the Umdisponierens of the workday established itself all around the holiday meanwhile, to be sure given us the coming year fewer such days. 
Also in the EU and in America, one understands something else under "holiday". 
The Hungarian right system distinguishes between country holidays and working free days. 
Working free days are stand usually church holidays, or with important historic events in connection. 
We celebrate for example also new year: Both the last day of the old, and the first day of the new year working free days are - latter alone already therewith the new year's eve-celebrating rest can themselves. 
In the entire year, we have altogether fourteen holidays. 
The country holidays are the 15 March, that reminds one of the revolution of 1848, and the 23 October, the commemorative days of the revolution of 1956. 
On the 20 August, the country foundation is celebrated, on the 1 May the work, remember on that 1st and 2 November we our dead. 
In addition it gives two holidays apiece to easter, Pentecost, and Christmas. 
There our countries, nationally fall or religious holiday rarely on a weekend, proved itself the practice of the "workday-postponement" in the cases, in which we would work before or after the holiday only a day. 
Weekends extended is the price of that to be sure that we very probably work at the Saturdays before that, or must go into the school. 
When this day, that falls before or after the holiday, worked off, in the end, is determined for some time years of the labor minister in an own ordinance. 
The legal specification applies to all employers and -nehmer, for public employees and official of the public service likewise. 
Excluded are only firms and arrangements, in which the business is continued without interruption, therefore also at the holidays. 
This year the working order is brought only through the holidays at the end of the year somewhat in confusion: From the 24 December, life remains formally stand in this country, take there that for the days between Christmas and new year's eve time balance, or the vacation canceled expressly for that. 
In the next year, more holidays fall into the week middle, and/or on the end of the week so that there will be less Umdisponierungen in the workdays, than this year. 
The calendar will be able to remain first all around the day the work "on the head placed", therewith the persons same four days at the piece at home. 
Saturday, the 26 April becomes a workday so that the Friday, 2 May can be a closing-day. 
The second Umdisponierung holds together with the holiday on the 23 October: One works off on Saturday, the 18 October the Friday, 24 October beforehand. 
The end of the year will stand to be sure completely in the sign of the holidays after from the 24 December everything remains lie and stand, even if new year's eve falls on a Wednesday.
