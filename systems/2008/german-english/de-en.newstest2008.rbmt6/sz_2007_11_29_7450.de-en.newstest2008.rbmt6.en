Department attack
In the Youtube-debate of the republican presidency candidates deliver itself both favorite Rudy Giuliani and avoided Romney a hard exchange of blows - and must fear now an outsider candidate. 
The strain of the candidates unloads itself already in the first subject. 
It had made New York to a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants", throws avoided Romney its contractor Rudy Giuliani before. 
This counters for its part with heavy accusations: "I would say, its own house was a harbor for illegal", Giuliani replies and throws the former governor of Massachusetts before to have busied privately immigrant without papers. 
The candidates blow to the attack: Because the republican basis has further no clear favorite, the eight presidency applicants use the debate on CNN above all in order to discredit its adversaries. 
The selbstgedrehten 30-Sekunden-Videos that Internet users sent in via Youtube are hardly more than a cue giver. 
"With this type of Isolationismus have we Hitler at the power come let", throws John McCain its contractor Ron Paul before, that demands as more only in the round an immediate deduction out of Iraq. 
Also Romney gets read the riot act of the Vietnam-veteran strongly when he refuses, the so named "Waterboarding", an interrogation method with which drowning is simulated when tortures to convict. 
The reactions of the hall public in St. Petersburg in Floridas show that the important subjects of the campaign lie in the mean time however on the far side of of Iraq war and torture debates. 
Whenever conservative values praised and rejected become future increases in taxes, surges approval in the auditorium up. 
At the same time appears once more where the weakness of both favorite lie. 
"I have me at that time erred", Romney explains contrite and performs Abbitte before basis and TV public for that that it 1994 yet to the abortion advocates belonged. 
Giuliani on the other hand comes into the rolling when it is asked about its opinion to the literal interpretation of the Bible.
