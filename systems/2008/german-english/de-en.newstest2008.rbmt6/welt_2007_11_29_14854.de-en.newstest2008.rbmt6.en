Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With "The Hunting party" and "homicidal peace", again two films with the Balkan Peninsula war busy themselves. 
Yet both do not convince. 
Either the drafts set too much on Action and Geballer or however it are too sentimental. 
There also Richard Gere in "The Hunting party" cannot help. 
The good message first: To be sure the war criminals hide themselves Karadzic and Mladic still in the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula, but calculated there, in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnia-war, was regained now the actor Richard Gere. 
We had lost the most beautiful man of the eighties years finally out of the eyes because all too many nicely-insignificant rolls in Wohlfühlfilmen expelled for women and all too many press conferences to the subject of buddhism one the desire on Hinsehen. 
Is now Richard Gere itself sudden the most important argument, "The Hunting party - if the hunters to the hunted becomes" must be (why film title today actually always so long and confused like engineer-tariff agreements?) perhaps yet to look at. 
It delivers one wonderfully augenzwinkernde representation: In the reason taken is its war reporter Simon Hunt that what would have been able to become out of Gere, if the fate and the film industry were not so gracious: A man, who has its very best times long behind itself, the remainder yet considerable however even as ruins same monument its decline of the former charm preserved has. 
But in spite of this trump, "The Hunting party" continues together with the German production "homicidal peace" that starts also in this week, only the endless row of failed Balkan Peninsula war-films. 
With "homicidal peace", one can make short process: The film is rescue about two German soldier in the Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), the one Serbin before kosovarischen sniper whereon the one falls in love promptly also yet with it. 
Although it is begrüßenswert, that here once the Serben are not represented as an exclusive root of all evil, the TV flat film loses itself all too quickly in Geballer and Action. 
It remains a type "alarm for Cobra 11" without freeway however for that with war. 
On the other hand can be investigated at "The Hunting party" quite in an exemplary manner why there was actually never a correctly good Balkan Peninsula war film. 
The story of three US war reporters that open itself to track around the Serbian waiter war criminal "the fox" down, would have been able to become other director and one with one other script author (both in personnel union Richard Shepard) another time perhaps a new "Apocalypse Now". 
For the stories are alike astonishing: Both times go small teams into the forest in order to complete something, what the military cannot and both times becomes it a trip into the insanity. 
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting party" is that one does not let be Simon Hunt simple the come down cynic with heart, when that he is introduced us at the beginning. 
No, the Script must impute in addition another romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin to it. 
Finally "The Hunting party" goes then the stream down if the reporter within the last five minutes in the Zeitrafferverfahren that succeeds, what Nato, CIA and all head money hunters of the world in five years did not create: The war criminal catch and leave the Muslim Bosniern to the just revenge. 
That is so bad that one would like to call the international court in the Hague because of crime against the movie theater logic. 
At the same time the film has a deeply human concern. 
It wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic yet always freely run around, and it suspects to not to operate the Americans and the Frenchmen (here should it itself exceptionally once united be) the pursuit based on secret political arrangements all too intensively. 
But the good meant and that are angry itself sometimes so similar that one a famous breaks-poem comes into the sense. 
Therein it is named over the wood costume of an Asian demon on the working table of the poet: "Sympathetic I see the swollen forehead veins, indicating: like strenuous it is, badly to its". 
Film like "The Hunting party" such threshold heads that indicate however have exactly how strenuous it is, to be good. 
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan Peninsula war film. 
Recently is would report become in this newspaper that all Iraq-films were flops large Hollywood. 
One can add: There was also never a good South Africa-film. 
Almost always counts: If a star gads itself on the trouble spot or mine fields of the world, comes so somewhat at the same time out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "hereafter of all boundaries" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio. 
Possibly all the conflicts are temporally simply yet too near. 
Decades had to pass nevertheless before Hollywood with "Schindlers list" was able to turn a good film over the Holocaust. 
Many a film becomes well yet ripe - the Vietnam-works valid now as classic "The deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "abundance Metal jacket" were celebrated at that time in no way unanimously as master works. 
But perhaps we know today where every measure murders in real time on immediately two screens at home comes, also simply too much over the conflicts of the world. 
And that steals the script clerks the Bedenkenlosigkeit that needs it in order to tell good stories. 
"Are or became not ware" or "the large dictator" in the end also therefore so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet, how badly the Nazi regime really ruled. 
Perhaps one may not be good want if one wants to make good films. 
Perhaps one must have the sarcastic dissociated artist view of the Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk. 
When that was questioned to parallels between its historic novel "Lemprières dictionary" and the Balkan Peninsula war, it answered: "That lies only that some things never change. 
Metropolises will be always terribly dangerous, persons will be murdered always in horrifying manner and always will rule war in Yugoslavia."
