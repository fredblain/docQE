Banks want to master crisis
The American Federal reserve, the European headquarters bank and the headquarters banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada concluded to fight jointly against the crisis on the financial markets. 
So more will arrive than 100 billion dollars by means of auction on the currency markets. 
On these auctions, the banks of interests rates auction are to be lent themselves, to which it ready mutually money. 
For example the American Fed sends makes 40 billions of dollar on auction, further 24 it for the European and the Swiss headquarters bank loosely. 
It is after the attacks the 11. September the first time that the headquarters banks of the single countries agree on a so coordinated action to the defense or Abmilderung of the consequences of a finance crisis. 
"This step should remove the largest difficulties of the economy, therefore the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consultation firm wrote Economic Outlook Group in a report for its customers. 
"The coordinated action of the headquarters banks diminished the probability of a recession in the USA of 65% on about 50%," joined Baumohl in its report thereto. 
The banks lost dollars because of not served credit already around 60 billion, above all in the United States. 
Analysts expect even further billion losses. 
"" The headquarters banks must have had really anxiety before that, what can come later yet everything, when to this action decided," the chief economist said of SMOOTHED Amro, Kieran Davies. 
"It looks so that the situation is really bad," said it further. 
The headquarters banks have the fear that if the banks have even heavily access to loans, for its customers credit also more expensively become. 
That would diminish the consumption and would fall the American economy into a recession, possibly with effects on the economic growth in the entire world. 
The headquarters banks decided in addition after it was not arrive them, that so-called. To layer LIBOR, that Londoner Interbankzinssatz, that is used in the money distribution between banks. 
That means that the banks had permanently anxiety to lend itself mutually money, and that although the headquarters banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain had layered during the autumn its interests rates repeatedly. 
"That will have the same effect like a further reduction of the interests rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the agency Reuters. 
Some analysts are the view that this step of the headquarters banks contributes to the up heating of the crisis, because he does not solve the basic problem, and to be sure the case of the real-estate market in the USA.
