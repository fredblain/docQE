To possess a car only the beginning is. 
For it is to be found even more hard the suitable MOTOR VEHICLE-insurance than the correct vehicle model. 
First of all once must be clear one wherewith we have to do it here. 
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder. 
This agreement is held in writing by means of an insurance contract, that determines that the company receives the arranged insurance premium and is obligated in return to produce in a case of damage the corresponding settlement. 
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that puts together itself through several factors, among other things age, sex, moment of the creation of the driver's license, marital status, type of the vehicle to be assured or its utilization. 
The insurance companies fix its prices corresponding to the statistics so that in a higher accident danger also higher contribution payments become due. 
For this reason must both perform belay less contribution payments over 25-year-old and women, for statistics that these groups show a slighter accident quota thanks to its caution. 
The same applies also to married persons, there this after statements of the statistical values and accordingly also after conviction of the businesses, to less accidents tend like single. 
The utility that is ascribed the vehicle impairs the frequency of the going and therewith also the probability of an accident. 
The more frequent the utilization, the more probable the damage. 
In the assembly of the premium, the insurances must consider a whole series of points. 
For this reason also the driver thoroughly must study the situation in order to select exactly the car insurance, that meets its personal needs at that soon. 
We list the most important points here now, that one should take in the selection of an insurance into consideration, in order to be able to encounter not only an achievement, but rather also a preisorientierte choice. 
That under 25-year-old encounter in the choice of a bargain insurance on numerous hindrances, e.g. the slight driving experience and the driver's license. 
Even if it would be for an ideal insurance protection best, to lock a Vollkaskoversicherung, it gives nevertheless more low-priced alternative. 
The careful drivers can select a Vollkasko with deductible so that the achievements of a Vollkaskoversicherung uncovered to be sure, but are offered to a low price. 
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay a part of the sum emerged by the damage itself. 
Sum is determined before conclusion of the contract and based on the height of the insurance premium. This is declared more highly the more slightly that to be paid Luis Noguera, head representative of Spain in First Europe, one settlement enterprising to be Online-insurances. 
Another option is not the expanded insurance, that assures the customer against external accident damages, however against the damages emerged at the own car. 
Moreover this type of the insurance would uncover theft, fire and vehicle loss. 
Here an advice. 
If you are old under 25 years, it lies increases in your hand, to sink the insurance costs; so your credit in that you try to go carefully and to avoid accidents. 
A credit is a decline of the basis tariff at the corresponding insurance company. 
In the opposite in addition included a punishment payment a raising purported tariff. 
Height credit and punishment payments depend on the company and its yields. 
If the business has a yield empire year behind itself, it can permit itself, clarifies the bonus-payments too Noguera. 
As soon as the 25-Jahre-Marke 25-Jahre-Marke years 25-Jahre-Marke SIGN is exceeded, it is to be locked for the drivers simpler a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving experience the accident quota sinks. 
Therefore it is the most meaningful to decide on a Vollkaskoversicherung with deductible. 
The youths can pull no utility out of its previous experience, both in the case an accident and at the time the going that of directors Spanish of the European business clarifies joins, and thereto that the majority of the accidents happen in the second practice year, after that was discarded the. 
Nevertheless it is at a married customer, who possesses no children, more advisable to lock a Vollkaskoversicherung; naturally only then if it allows the financial situation of the corresponding person also. 
On the part of the insurer, married couples with children count as the customers with the slightest accident quota, and accordingly low also its contribution payments fall from. 
In this case, a Vollkaskoversicherung with deductible (in a sum about 300 Euro) would be the best option. In the case that one received a high credit, recommends itself an expanded insurance that uses first to the third vehicle year. 
Altogether more relaxed go and possess a larger buying power that permits it them, a higher contribution payment places Luis Noguera firmly. 
For pensioner, it offers itself to lock a Vollkaskoversicherung with deductible (in a sum about 150 Euro), or an expanded insurance, that uses first in a sufficiently high credit. 
In the end one must hold that the car insurance is somewhat very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damages, but rather rescues also, because it high costs, that require it, that a thorough selection is encountered, that corresponds to our personal situation.
