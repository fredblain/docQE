With almost five weeks to the year conclusion at the stock exchange, the investors rub themselves with regard to the coming Endjahres-Rally already the hands. 
Nevertheless the experts can generate relating to this no certain prognoses. 
Banif believes in that statistically observes, the month of December the stock exchange normally with a positive market development walks
Nevertheless it is not advisable to generate prognoses short-termed and only on the base of statistics. If seriously tensions to be taken determine the current market events
Although other experts do not approve of a such strong increase in prices in that last week the year, these notice in given determined becomes nevertheless, that stock exchange course by that liquidity of the market and the market participant. These invest based on the lacking at certain share fund mainly in pension fund, which strongly is concerned by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend there to productive assets. 
Consequently the stock exchange will show in the opinion of these experts sooner one sooner lateralen, of market variations of influenced course trend, all because we cannot estimate yet the sizes of the possible decline of the interest rate the US-bank of issue to lead back an uncertainty that above all to the increased crude oil-price and the danger of the climb of the inflation rate
Javier bar Rio, chairperson of the sale department in BPI in Spain, agrees therewith that it would be a ventured moment to announce an impending market-Rally. 
Chances stand assures not very the expert. 
The Spanish share index Ibex lost a value of 4% already since its highly sign on the 8 November of 15,945.7 points. 
But all experts do not divide the same negative opinion. 
After view of Juan Solana, analyst in Intermoney, could the Ibex 35 as a result of the restructuring of the Investmentfonds and the traditional subsidy undertaken each year around this time of the pension fund, that lock year successfully with almost 16,000 points. 
Nevertheless the expert lifts forth that this year could develop the things somewhat differently; above all based on that already in the second December week, and accordingly directly after the bridge day to the day of the state, taking place Endjahres-Rally. 
In the opinion of the analyst the price variations would not influence the market tendencies. 
After estimation of Federico Olucha, analyst in the bank Inversis, be copy could the previous judgments to the market condition on an almost technical level, what could lead in addition, themselves soon a deviation of the index value, whose sizes depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis. 
The analyst trusts on that that these positively fall out. 
In the selection of the values, that should push the Ibex to new maximums, the analysts are themselves united. 
Solana of Intermoney assures that year the large values at the row
To the value-winners, the expert would count the two large banks and some immobile companies, that current sector are too expensive to the given moment
In the meantime Federico Olucha assures of the bank Inversis that the climbs in connection with the bank sector and industry sector will walk. 
If the Rally actually happens, the immobile companies will profit from it. 
ACS was hope in the last months on Aufholkurs and we that other immobile companies such as Ferrovial and FCC the same way so the expert. 
With respect to the increased consumption behavior during the Christmas days, the consumption periodic will determine the market events in the last half of the year. 
On the other hand the expert believes that also the technologies will obtain positive revenue results, even if they are represented on the Spanish market only in slight number. 
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, the December showed sinking share price developments only in two cases. 
When end 2003 burst the technology-bubble, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and initiated simultaneously the previously last real Endjahresrallye. 
The December showed this year, in which the Ibex 35 made up around 28.17 points, an increase in prices of 6.68%. 
Whether 2008 becomes the fifth profitable year in consequence, (the Ibex climbs since January around 8.36%) and also an Endjahresrally can show, will appear.
