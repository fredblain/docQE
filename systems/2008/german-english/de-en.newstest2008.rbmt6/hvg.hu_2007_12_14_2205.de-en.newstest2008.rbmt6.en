It all right make want - or how becomes one for other uninteresting
Stop and go-traffic, the car middle in the allmorgendlichen obstruction. 
Out of the radio erklingt a strange melody: The sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects. 
I turn the volume more highly. 
The speed changes, comes to the previous sounds the bass, and as a real sound jewel a feminine choir. 
It is the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar, that on MR2 erklingt. 
The domestic music scene did not pamper us long time just with qualitative Electropop. 
But now one sees even the obstruction differently if one hears at the same time the new album of Zagar. 
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many a new and exciting production out of the domestic digital Underground-scene contribute slowly to a variation of the general view, and even if the garage skirt with its Gitarrengequitsche is again "in", the domestic Electropop proves: There is new under the sun. 
Balázs Zságer began in Pécs, played itself in the volume Yonderboi before it - perhaps, because a tavern no two pipers endures - began to follow its own way. 
The breakthrough with its project (Zagar) and its music, the elements out of jazz, Electronic, and pop fuses, created approached was it however first as one with the favor to compose the Soundtrack to a film, at it (z. B. 
"Szezon" of Ferenc Török). 
The formation, that had appeared originally in smaller club, became the wider public first well known, than the magazine „wan2" its first album from the year 2002 under the Top 50 domestic albums lined up and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to the nearly only, also in the west marketable trendsetter kürte. 
Doubtless Zagar and its volumes were interested "trendy", it however no whether they carry this sign also gladly. 
The volumes reacted, should how it: With a new, even better album. 
The now appeared new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open them new ways, to be sure the title presses already the wish after continuity with the Pécser years from. 
The expression originates namely the time when Balázs Zságer was yet with another volume underway. 
The airy, flying allusion would be also in order, to be sure that - the zeitgeist and the trend corresponding - are noticeable next to the ethereal character of the music pure guitar, the influences of the rock'n'roll. 
With these songs, that in England living and with the volume "The Puzzle" working singers György Ligeti imagined in the premiere in the Millenáris. 
A song of the album created it even to the radio pop song - that since newest MR2 sending by early until late pop music set the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", that was received with the assistance of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas",), successive the ear worm. 
All in order therefore (?). 
The hvg. hu inquired in Balázs Zságer. 
Hvg. hu: This new hit raises the question: Does to what extent layer remain reserve your music of a conscience? 
Balázs Zságer: The concept "layer music" does not mean me just much. 
According to my opinion it does not give two boxes in the pop music, and to be sure Mainstream and Underground, or alternatively and pop, but rather commercially and honestly. 
Even the so-called alternative-music-or-Underground-music can be shallow and meaningless, can produce become just as it however also only for the sale, that makes it to commercial music. 
Also a good pop-number can develop from an honest subject. 
The reception readiness of the listener functions also after this principle, of languages and country boundary independently. 
Hvg. hu: Do you see a difference in the candor of the Hungarian and the foreign public vis-à-vis your music? 
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, the pop music has a larger tradition. 
There not only teenager or Twens go on concerts, but rather also the older public. 
They pursue the trends in the pop music that happen around it around, much more attentively because they consider it also to be a part of the contemporary culture. 
Hvg. hu: Which roll comes the public to in your work? 
It is hear important, who, where, wieviele your music? 
B. Zs.: It is natural a good feeling, to see that more and more to our concerts come. 
We never composed however for the market. 
Here the music does not emerge in order to serve a purpose, but rather for a certain reason. 
The roll of the public is usually in the concerts noticeably where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is that again only in the intangible variations of the moment. 
Nevertheless is been noticeable me one: If you quite want to make it all, you are no longer interesting. 
Hvg. hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi? 
It is as a soloist underway and constructed its career sooner in the west. 
B. Zs.: We do not go really its way, once therefrom entirely seen that one tries again and again to read into this into our music. 
We see ourselves sooner than team Player, that let trust on the musical presence of the other and can be unfolded it. 
Originally were natural comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi unavoidable because several of us come out of its volumes and hit another way. 
Hvg. hu: In the Charts of MR2, "Wings takes precedence of Love". 
Many heard not until the name Zagar to the connection with this number. 
Was the opening with one deliberately produced somewhat more popular style toward a wider public? 
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, that should serve then as a train horse for the album. 
In this song, it concerns more. 
It was thought as a finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult subjects. 
Hvg. hu: How did you select the six singers? 
Why was just it, what the Leitprinzip? 
B. Zs.: The basic idea was, to make a Gospel-good choir. 
Then the idea came to assemble the choir out of gifted soloist of the domestic music scene. 
So the six headed choir emerged - therefore Sena, Eden Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh -, that we then apäter "Underground Divas" baptized have. 
Hvg. hu: Did you want to have the song just as, or the girls have it with shape? 
B. Zs.: There was was finished the number already more long in the instrumental version, but as the material for the album, thought we us that this number needs" yet "something. 
The accord sequence demanded formally after a song voice. 
I warmed up the melody yet in the same night, learned later it the girls. 
All came practically on attempt and frightening spontaneously. 
I can remember, I was galvanizeed at that time rather, but it needed already also the "Divas". 
With my voice alone the song never would have become so strong. 
Hvg. hu: Both on the disk, and in the concert one had however the impression that would be girl in the background. 
There is no solo-part (seen of the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own roll, sing perfectly together and are not more loudly, than the music, therefore its song not only is accompanied of the music. 
Also on the stage, they stood behind. 
Is it intention? 
B. Zs. : That they are stood behind, was because of purely technical problems so. 
To be sure we wanted to approach let them deliberately no solo-rolls. 
In the number, it goes also therefore that one should forget its ego a few, forget, who come from where and is where underway, let we simply to that us these certain wings that wings raise the dear. 
I would have gladly that also other sense this euphoric condition, that we sensed, when the song emerged. 
Hvg. hu: Which was the costliest song? 
B. Zs.: In the musical Schaffensarbeit actually quite no, it gave sooner more difficult tasks in the mixing. 
For example in "Dorian Gray's it dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or in „Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls" where the Groove not more long wanted to function, but gradually everything joined itself, like in a Puzzle. 
Hvg. hu: Which is your favorite number of the new album? 
B. Zs.: That changes with the concerts running and also now that I have the album "losgelasssen". 
Presently "Never The seed" are it "prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number.
