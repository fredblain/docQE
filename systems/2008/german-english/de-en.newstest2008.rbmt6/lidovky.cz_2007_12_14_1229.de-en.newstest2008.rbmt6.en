Klaus: Debates of the ecologist are incredulous
Global climate variations damage nominally developing countries most. 
President VÃ¡clav Klaus expressed himself again to the problematic nature of the global warming. 
The criticism had reference to the conference going international to end of the UN to the climate change on Bali now. 
In Vienna where it "a bluer its book, no green planet" presented, led it from that the debates of the ecologist would be incredulous. 
According to Klaus not only the structure of the conference is not would form unacceptable, the one strange mixture of government representatives and such of government organizations, but rather also the basic difference between the rhetoric, that it accompanying, and the reality. 
"The debate there is unstrukturiert, it is some word fireworks, that is only replacement for an actual solution of present problems," Klaus said. 
The Czech president emphasized in the presentation of its beech that its subject would be very important for it, and that he would engage himself for that therefore so. 
It pressed also its contentment about that from that its book would appear in German translation, because "I often on caricature of my views treffe." 
Now interested parties could read about its attitude therefore undistorted. 
Klaus remembered that he would be no Klimatologe, but he has its opinion after sufficient prerequisites in order to write such a book. 
Let it be in the end academician, capably to understand and to judge professional treatises, would have experience with statistics and would be also people economist. 
As head statements of the beech designated it the thesis that the climate permanently would change and that its variations normally would be therefore, that there would be to global warming no concurring opinion under the scientists, that the consequences of the present variations seriously would not be all too large and and therefore no threat represented, and that the efforts to influence, the development of the climate, would be superfluous, ineffectual and unacceptably costly. 
In addition it would stop would see it as someone, whom experiences with totalitarian Sytemen would have, for unacceptably to force other unproven views, it that as a dangerous restriction of the freedom. 
On questions of present declared it repeats, would be it not against "a sensible environmental protection, but against militant organically-activists, that no consideration take on the ratio between expense and yield." 
Over the same subject, Klaus in Vienna had spoken already two months ago in the Hayek-institute.
