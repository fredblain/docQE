All yet openly
If Romey avoided said, it would not hold it a presidency candidate laud to be questioned of a snow man. 
Nevertheless declared itself the republican candidate for the presidency last of all ready to stand a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters receive and submit questions on video, in order to send it the candidate. 
None of the questions, that on Wednesday evening, the 28 November, raised became, were as laughable as the snow man, the democrats over the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party questioned. 
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time exactly the condition of the republican party, that breaks open into the choices in the next year. 
It is not well known, exactly like the makers of CNN, that the debate sometimes support that selected the concerning candidate to showing YouTube Clips. 
However in the first half hour of the debate, that was dedicated longest that to a single subject, immigration in the midpoint stood. 
The subject is one of the most powerful subjects for republican. 
The CNN asked to serve a group of undecided voters a dial if they heard things, that filed them: The television company noted spoke tip of the approval as the candidates exertally over the boundaries. 
The sharpest and longest exchange the evenings was between Rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner, and Romney that pushed itself in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire forwards. 
To shake off Giuliani tried the call, it had been yielding with respect to illegal immigration when it was mayor of New York. 
It attacked accused Romney in that it the former governor of Massachusetts to have adjusted illegal immigrants for work at its house. 
Both sat down asked especially violently apart as a questioner whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals a regular status and the possibility on the country citizenry give would become). 
More insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman out of Colorado, succeeded it in this subject after hook. 
None both men has earnest chances in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they chopped earlier and more hard than other on the immigration kettledrum. 
At least in the area of the immigration, the candidates in the large and entire divide the same views: sharper boundaries, intolerance vis-Ã -vis illegal migrant. 
This subject, together with anxieties over poisonous toy from China or other worries over the remainder of the world, help to forget or to minimize the republicans the differences between liberal and Christian conservative. 
But the debate was brought became unambiguously problematically as other subjects the language. 
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported weapon restrictions in the past. 
John McCain and Romney discussed about whether simulated drowning should be regarded as a torture. 
One of the questioner asked whether the candidates believe each word of the Bible. 
This in addition that Giuliani represented the standpoint, that although the Bible be preferred keep the books would be, not literally would believe it the story of Jonah and the whale perhaps. 
A further questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty. 
Mike Huckabee - now contrary to all expectations on the first place in a survey carried out recently in Iowa thanks to its for some time existing Christian conservativism - said that the death penalty would be painful, but necessary. 
When he was pressed on that, whether Jesus would advocate it, he laughed about that and said was Jesus too intelligently around itself around a political office to apply. 
The race remains extraordinary far openly. 
Huckabees ascent in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls youngest contribution success and its approval storm in the debate of Wednesday. 
Both are rocketted out of that nothing because both wing of the party until now not yet on one of the better known and more traditional candidates agree could. 
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has the party from the beginning and convincing united with a triumphant message over the size of America and a winking to both wings of the party. 
The party is split this time and is the result by far not clear.
