Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
How environment minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meeting will go on Tuesday to end, and the debate over the international climate-regime after 2012 is continued of the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening. 
Expert and politician out of 192 countries advise over the schedule of Bali, in which the emissionsreduzierenden measures are determined for the time after 2012, therefore at the end of the Kyoto-protocol. 
Presently a violent debate between industrialized countries and developing countries in the gear is. 
The USA already signaled that they do not want to negotiate over concrete numbers, to be sure they would be ready to reduce until 2020 the greenhouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990 around 25-40 percent. 
The other large question of the conference is whether the industrial nations are ready, next to the reduction of the emissions the developing countries both financially and technological to support. 
Also an agreement on the support of developing countries was obtained. 
That the Kyoto-protocol imputed is supposed to be administered adaptation fund by a 16-headed advice, presumably in the global environment facility (GEF) of the UN, like in the "Piac és profit" to read about is. 
Hungary six percent
Environment minister Gábor Fodor supports the striving of the EU in the name of Hungary to retain its forerunner roll in global climate protection-measures, and to obtain a new international agreement until 2009. 
The minister explained, the EU would not reduce the greenhouse gas emissions until 2020 around 20% (measured by the values of 1990), independently of whether that successfully would be obtained according to "come off 2012", or. The union would be are also ready even ready to advocate a 30-percent reduction, soferne other large industrial nations of the world, and/or developing countries to come later its obligations after powers and responsible. 
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the objective of the countries that 1997 had joined the Kyoto-protocol was, a reduction of solely 5.2 percent, whereas the EU with its at that time 15 member countries had promised already to a minus of 8%. 
The specification for Hungary reads reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions around 6% in comparison with the years 1985-87 - a specification that thoroughly will fulfill the country to read about like in the press release of the environment ministry is. 
The use is high on Bali - nevertheless must the long-term international climate political come off within two years be finished, would step otherwise it with security first after 2012 effective. In this case, no renewed, international emission reduction system would follow the reduction intention determined in the Kyoto-protocol, whose meaning also the IPCC that emphasized international, with the Nobel Peace Prize excellent scientific climate change-committee of the UN in its youngest report. 
Through it the emission reduction would delay would be itself, and the increase of the average temperature of the earth around more than 2°C unavoidable, what would have according to scientists extremely serious and irreparable consequences as a consequence.
