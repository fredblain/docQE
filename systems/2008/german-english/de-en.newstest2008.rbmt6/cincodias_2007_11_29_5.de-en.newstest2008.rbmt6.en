Popular will have opened its 200 credit banks of Monday through Friday 12 hours at the day. 
Popular concluded to modernize a large part of its branch. 
Altogether 200 therefrom are established in the economy strongest regions of Spain. 
For the institute, that operates under the brand name Popular Max, these agencies mean a large milestone. 
But also for the remaining Spanish institutes, there Popular as the first bank group represents ventures the leap to extend the opening times of its branch weekdays until 20.30h and to prepare Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h. 
The bank group BBVA, that draw lots be reported also the extension of its opening times in the agencies repeatedly, grasped previously yet no definitive decision. 
The currently running negotiations of the bank with the labor unions do not seem to aim on a unification, with which 75% of all branch are closed Saturdays and open for that at a weekday in the afternoon, if for the clientele. 
Whether further banks of the new initiative join, that adapts themselves the business opening times, will depend on that experience valued the Popular bank. 
And straight that is also the intention that pursues Popular with its project. 
It that opening times of that branch to extend is grasp can goal, that based on its situation the kauflustige clientele more independent, smaller and mittelständiger business, but also that of large department stores. 
The bank would like to open the new 200 branch places in the course of the coming 18 months because it does not concern new, but rather changed opening times. 
For that the bank will reshape the accomodations of those agencies, will adjust that are already in business zones, and it simultaneously the individual customer profile of the different zones. 
So the expansion of the opening times is connected with a new room formation of the branch, that distinguishes itself through a more current, more colorful design. 
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring would require no larger investments, but would walk with an increased personnel attitude, there a branch now no longer six, but rather eight or nine employees necessary. 
The agencies, that will be equipped even with additional accomodations for the KMU, will sell no financial products. 
A positive experience for the group
Popular tested its draft already at nine branches in Madrid. 
And the experience valued fell out positively, so Ángel Rivero. 
The agencies of the streets Bravo Murillo, O´Donell and the Gran Vía were selected for that, what a smart decision seems been be. 
Popular leads momentarily ca. 2500 agencies. 
And further 60 that operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized on immigrant and wise also expanded opening times up, even at Sundays and holidays. 
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of the BBVA is not used because that will offer a wide selection of them instead at not finance services for sale. 
Wanting for our customers no competition Rivero explains. 
With Telefonica, they came provisionally to the unification to sell with the help of of external bank personnel mobile phones.
