Those are not Warhols boxes
He who connects the term Sweden and wood box, does not think of Ikea, but at Andy Warhol. 
Or yet? 
Presently manufactured wood boxes throw dark shadows in Sweden on Warhols work index. 
Forgeries are a large part of the ninety-four Brillo-boxes listed there by the "type Stockholm". 
After the Swedish newspaper stirred up "expresses" some months ago doubt about the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo-boxes of the year 1968, internal investigations in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm conclude now sobering: The six "Brillo-boxes", that the former museum director Pontus Hultén left as a donation to the Moderna Museet 1995, are copies - and well also the large part of the approximately hundred further Brillo boxes of that "type Stockholm" that are on the international art market in circulation. 
The prehistory is interlocks, a confusing concatenation more artistic and kuratorischer productions. 
Created Warhol in New York 1964 its first "Brillo-boxes", painted wood boxes, that are based "Brillo" on the red-blue-white design of the carton of the soap powder. 
A display of its work in the Moderna Museet 1968 issued - with Warhols agreement - hundreds of Brillo-boxes out of cardboard: These did not come (from costs reason) of Warhol, but rather were delivered directly out of the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik. 
It did not concern works of art, but rather around its examples, around bare display items. 
Simultaneously Warhol 1968 gave probably the permission let produce some few Brillo-Holzkisten in Sweden, that were not issued to be sure in the Moderna Museet. 
Time witness speak now about approximately fifteen boxes, that at that time as authorized Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the label "type Stockholm" to right went in into the art story and auction story. 
Many an of them obtained on auction more than 100,000 dollars. 
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén maintained later falsely, 1968 approximately hundred wood boxes in Sweden had been produced and issued, leave would have the Warhol then to it. 
Actually Hulténs were produced 105 boxes first 1990 in Malmö for a display in St. Petersburg. 
At this time Warhol was already three years dead. 
Lars Byström, boss curator at the Moderna Museet, examined also three next to the six museum own Brillo-boxes out of Swedish private possession, of which two 1968 in Stockholm were prepared: Your press chip disk became first grundiert and sanded, was applied after that white oil paint with a brush. 
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 on the other hand does not betray that the color with a painter roll was applied without undercoat directly on the press chip disk - moreover concerns it oil paint, but rather around Acrylfarbe. 
Be not reported "these boxes became of the artist authorizes and should of the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-boxes removes become", lets the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, : "If the 'Andy Warhol type Authentication Board' in New York not to one other end comes, becomes the Moderna Museet the six boxes in its collection as copies/display material classify." 
Already in July to be sure the Authentication Board announced to investigate the "heavy accusations", that are raised in things of the soap powder-boxes. 
Yet since then one wraps himself there into inexorable being quiet.
