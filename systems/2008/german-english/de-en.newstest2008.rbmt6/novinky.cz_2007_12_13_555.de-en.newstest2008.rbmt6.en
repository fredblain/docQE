Kitesurfing, gulf and Roulette. 
On the islands of the Caribbean, you find that in superabundant measure. 
Only on an island, you find however yet much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the large Antillen. 
Cuba was at present the Spaniards its bastion for the conquests America. 
Kolumbus named it the most beautiful place that a human eye apiece perceived. 
Havanna became once a warehouse or run warehouse of treasures, that had stolen the Spaniards in America, and to Europe of transported then. 
And then the American epoch came. 
The hotel Nacional emerged entirely at the end of the 20th century. 
Building let was seen it one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, for all, what counted in the USA as a crime, (especially during the prohibition), on Cuba gladly and supports - drug, gamble, prostitution. 
Under its guests were among other things
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra. 
In Havanna, high-rises grew went, over the wide Boulevards cars that were years of the past Jahrhundets among the cult symbols of the fifties. 
Ernest Hemingway bought itself a property in San Francisco de Paula, in the vicinity Havannas, and in Cojímar, it had lie its yacht. 
At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, star of the show business and politician left behind out of entirely America its signatures. 
And today? 
At the walls of the Bodeguita of Havanna, also you can leave behind your autograph. 
At the bar in the hotel Nacional, one mixes cocktails for you entirely after wish. 
And the cult cars of the fifties go in Havanna until today around because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats in the salty and damp air fell apart already a long time. 
If Havanna, especially its oldest part, strongly may have come down, finds nowhere one in the vicinity so many wonderful colonial sights such as just here. 
Other places become just out plaster, for example Trinidad. 
In regard on that that the tourism brings urgently necessary money, gave it for this development green light. 
In the last fifteen years, new hotels emerged not only in Havanna, but rather also in Varadero, at the coast of the province Holguín and also on island such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and other. 
Cuba offers another Marotte that uniquely is in the world and dresses above all railroad lover. 
Steam and diesel business narrow trace railroad to the sugar factories brought the sugarcane of remote plantations. 
Your Fuhrpark was not renewed over decades, and so one sees there putzige and fully functioning locomotives whose contemporaries stand in the museum somewhere else a long time. 
Excursion goal
The majority of the visitors Kubas does not leave out the bedeutendendsten places. 
So one must write over Varadero or Havanna no longer in detail. 
Remains only to mention that in the already mentioned property Hemingways a museum is, whose visit should not escape let itself that, that likes this author. 
The Viñales-valley in the west of the island is one of the picturesqueest angles Kubas. 
The luxurious vegetation are awake on chalk ground. 
The Mogotas, chalk hills and -rocks, tower gathered weathered covered are itself steeply by the valley ground, in its cavities fruitful ground on, by that also rock areas of thick Bewuchs. 
It is this valley where the tobacco best Cuban perhaps is cultivated. 
In its Endform, you can encounter on it if you visit one of the cigar factories of Havanna. 
Possibly it appears also interesting to many a that there the Chilean consequence of the TV series "major Zeman" was turned. 
Trinidad
An age old city, that shortly after the Spaniards the island colonized had, established became. 
Renown and wealth the trade with slave and sugar brought it. 
The wealth embodied itself in the jewelry beauty of the small city. 
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced of the later French settlers, did hardly change for four hundred years. 
Trinidad, between which sea and the Escambray-mountains lain, is a so remote place that it gave there yet into the fifty years of the last century no street, that would have connected the area with the remaining country. 
This isolation contributed in addition that it remained unnoticed. 
Was nothing constructed there, but was dismantled therefore also nothing, everyone was happy that it had a roof over the head. 
If one has more for Trinidad than an afternoon time, it is worthwhile to look at interesting places in the environment, like about the beach Playa Ancón or the "valley of the sugar factories". 
In the evening one should go then la Música into the Casa de, is not quiet that animates itself after the darkness, and where the music to the morning. 
Baracoa
This village entirely in the East Kubas many a designate as the most beautiful of the island. 
Certainly this view is influenced also through the way there. 
Both streets that lead of Guantánamo there must overcome and pass high and zerküftete mountains through a landscape, that is hardly touched by human intervention. 
The UNESCO included this eastern outpost Kubas thanks to the untouched nature there in its world heir-index. 
There the best chocolate is produced, shows in the church one the cross of Kolumbus (in reality is it about hundred years after the trips of Kolumbus emerged), and of the hill where the former castle, the present hotel stands el Castillo,, are to be seen several chalkboard mountains, of which el Yunque is the best known. 
Over the coffee, that around, the cigars, the Sierra-Maestra-mountains, the pig bay and the island Isla de Pinos, over the Tropicana-cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, over the Santeria, an African religion, to which the descendants of slave confess themselves, over all that one could write many sides. 
Yet, like one so says: Look at better with own eyes.
