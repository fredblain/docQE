In many places is saved at disinfectant
This year more were registered than thousand infections in hospitals, that were to be led back to an improper contact with antibiotics. 
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overburdening of the personnel - all factor, that are the damming of the infections not exactly beneficial, so the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center. 
In many places is saved also in the disinfectants. 
In the Traumatologie department of the János hospital, a MRSA-infection was diagnosed lately. 
The bacterium resistant against antibiotics was found in a masculine patient, who was delivered after a heavy accident into the hospital. 
The patient was isolated. 
At the beginning of the year, there was here already a similar infection. 
The injured of a heavy car accident was released out of the hospital, had to return little later the man to be sure with a MRSA-infection. An important operation could not be carried out since then because of the bacterium, that is still in the body of the patient, yet. 
Until 10 December of this year released infections were reported out of hospitals 1094 through multiresistente pathogen at the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system, so the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center, Karolina Böröcz. 
So many, through multiresistente pathogen released infections were registered in the hospitals therefore with security, would be allowed to be however higher the dark figure. 
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) became of the MRSA, that released against Methicillin-Oxacillin of resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 
The Staphylococcus aureus (SOWED) bacterium carries about one-third of the persons in its nose, without that it would cause an illness. 
SOWED-contingent infections (like about sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) react usually well to antibiotics, they are well curable. 
The means will dose improper used develop from quickly spread themselves to be sure to highly or, that well respondierenden bacteria antibiotics-resistant, that under corresponding conditions in the hospitals. 
Especially with patients with weakened, or durably badly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with slight body weight these bacteria can heavy infections how about wound infection or blood poisoning cause, therefore sepsis. 
According to the MRSA-infection is belong nothing special, such occurrences to the sick house everyday life to the medical leader of the János hospital. 
One would not be allowed to confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA does not give it only there where it is not sought. 
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the care personnel carries rubber gloves and costumes in the provision, and we control the antibiotics" necessary for the treatment - so Tibor Nyulasi. 
In its delivery into the hospital, the patients are examined to be sure on MRSA, not always can be avoided an infection nevertheless. 
Sample removals too rarely
The majority of the infections released by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, to be sure let the presently ruling conditions and circumstances be unfavorable for the checking of the origin or the expansion of the multiresistenten pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz. 
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and age homes, the hospitals should examine the delivered patients and should isolate MRSA-infected immediately. 
In the Hungarian hospitals, the microbiological sample removal becomes however not so frequent practice. 
Finally because there are not no subsidies on the part of the national health insurance company for this investigation. 
Most cases would come therefore first then at the daylight if the patient has already a noticeable MRSA-infection, so the medical leader of the epidemiology center. 
On the part of the European Union, it gives gives strict recommendations to the corresponding use of antibiotics in the humane medicine, it however also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes. 
Antibiotic-therapies should be purposeful, that is, are microbiological investigations necessary so that no resistance to can form the means, to be sure this directive also not always is kept of hospitals. 
Under the ambulatory, or in the reason provision of present patient let microbiological sample removals be themselves even even rarer, so Karolina Böröcz. 
Saved becomes in the disinfectants
Scientific proofs belay that MRSA is transferred by a patient to the other most frequently by the care personnel. 
For this very reason approaches gives the Händewaschen, or the carrying of gloves and costumes a large meaning, to be sure it also on this zone considerable deficiencies in the hospitals. 
MRSA is transmitted through Tröpfcheninfektion or contact, exists in the domestic hospitals however not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient. 
The rooms are even often overfills, that lined up beds tightly to each other, although there should be between them from epidemiological point of view a distance of at least 1.5 meters. 
How Karolina Böröcz further notices in, comes gives it unfortunately in the financially less well placed hospitals even before that in disinfectant saved becomes, it few caretakers, many patients - all factor that favor the origin of infections quite. 
Such infections are there demonstrable far less frequent, or the further distribution of the pathogen can be delayed where these precautions are kept, so Karolina Böröcz. 
Government program against MRSA
To got MRSA-infections into the handle caused the health insurances enormous costs, therefore they are fought everywhere. 
In England for example the prevention became of MRSA, and/or its checkings in the government program held. 
After first signs, the program is successfully - belay like published data, is the tendency of the MRSA-infections in England retrograde. 
The European center for illness prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the origin of multiresistenten pathogens (under that also MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities explains.
