Political Capital: Hungarian corps increases country risk
In the opinion of the department for risk analysis (Risk Analysing division) of Political Capital the activities of the corps established Hungarian in this August with support the "movement for a better Hungary" raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several regard. 
In the "risk warning-report" of the institute, it is named among other things: In the connection with the activities of the Hungarian corps, the highest political risk places lead could" the "intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gipsy and not gipsy population in Hungary there, that even short-termed to violent ethnic discussions. 
Let head reason for that be the strategy of the Hungarian corps, that aims probably on the provocation of such a discussion, so the research institute. 
How reports, this is looked at as a failure of sides of the politically responsible: "Persons of the public life left / the discussion of the Romany-question to representatives of radical political grouping, constructed have" that now its political strategy on the Romany-Hungary-contrast. 
One assumes that these intensify the problem, that impossibly make sensible dialogue, extremities favor, as well as the probability of violent discussions increase would become. 
The Forschungsinsitut does not mean would have moreover, that activities of the Hungarian corps, finally thanks to the enormous attention of sides of the domestic and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad considerably damaged, especially what the confidence into the stability and democratic maturity concerns". 
We remember: Since autumn 2006 the reorganization is of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary continuously in the upswing so that since summers 2007 several were established itself, "national self-defense united" naming organizations. 
"These groupings is meanly, that it itself respectively as a civil organization define, while it openly therewith boast, its members on - sometimes armed - defense task to prepare (catastrophe protection, national defense, Ordnungshütung), with reference to the unfitness of the police, the army, or the country itself", was named it. 
And further: That everything happens in accordance with that method, that tries, different to camouflage on the politics unwillingness and party unwillingness of the population being based, political strivings as a middle class initiative. 
The emphasis of the civil character and the united form serve emerge could therefore not merely the evasion of juristic hurdles, that in the train of the entry in court - it is at the same time a political strategy. 
How the analysis to take is, the activities of the Hungarian corps represent a risikoerhöhenden factor also for the relations with the neighboring states. 
"In the last months the Hungarian corps in several neighboring states was quoted as a potential danger source, sees so many an ultra nationalistic politician of certain neighboring countries in the origin of the Hungarian corps the confirmation of its own Anti-Hungary-politics. 
That everything has effects on the political stability of the region" - was named it. 
The foundation of the Hungarian corps is from the viewpoint the research institute no single phenomenon in headquarters-east-Europe, therefore the political risk grew for the total region. 
How reports, the activities of the Hungarian corps are with which the Bulgarian national corps comparable, whose foundation in August 2007 was announced by the radical right-wing Bulgarian national union (BNU). 
In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian corps, the Romany measure riots, that took place in a quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana), stood. 
The BNU took the occurrences immediately to the occasion to the foundation of the national corps, with which argument that the goal of the organization would be the "national protection". 
According to your opinion was remained same in the past 17 years a regular "gipsy terror" in Bulgaria noticeable, the country however inactive and indifferent - so Political Capital. 
And further: The initiative would have kicked off a violent debate in the Bulgarian public. 
How said, the increased risk for ethnic discussions is belaid also through the fact that some Bulgarian Romany-organizations announced to establish its own corps to resistance purposes. 
Because the activities of the Hungarian corps until now many resemblances with which the Bulgarian national corps show it is not to be excluded that the Hungarian Romany also, with whom organizing of its own protection react to the threats, it is named in the risk warning report of Political Capital. 
Attila Juhász, research director in Political Capital said on inquiry of the message office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute. 
Annually risk analysis reports would be published, and risikoverändernden tendencies should be recognizable, is informed the public opinion, like in the case through the publication of the risk warning report.
