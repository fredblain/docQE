England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost just as hard like the other. 
Who should strike as a number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara? 
And, fewer relevantly in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should the decision not encounter? 
The second question is important because David Graveney, the choice chair is, on proclamation at least under this special title, here in order to help the boss trainer Peter of bog and the captain Michael Vaughan at the same time to decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director fills itself, gradually with application for national voter offices, if not even for which in part-time. 
He, who does not get also always the sixth beater position, will be unfortunate, but life is often unjust and the sport is it undoubted. 
It never is enabled simple, exact festzunageln, what a person to reach the tip of its occupation branches while someone out never gets differently over the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of good fortune instead of capacity. 
It is not only in the Kricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, that always at the end are subjective. 
Is it the correct moment for Bopara to climb? 
Is it fairly to Shah if it does it? 
The same can perhaps also in an area further asked become whether for example John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young management with good conclusion that know the business well should be conveyed. 
Who say can, what the correct class is for a Kricketspieler, unless, it the possibility is given, to swim or to sink. 
Obviously numbers have a large influence on decisions, but chances have this also. 
Within a team, a Kricketspieler must catch the eye of the captain to the correct moment if he can take a Wicket and a beater must regular chances on the order get if he wants to make as an one-day Kricketspieler impression. 
To catch the eyes of the selection more complicated is. 
There was many, that in the last season better than, for example when James Anderson were, that will play apparently in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares itself to be healthy and like the wind into the networks kegelt. 
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 Runs apiece in order to earn a position in this tour. 
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same directed average, but both had its highlights and hope for yet more. 
Whether Shah or Bopara in the Asgiriya stage plays, can be only one view sought after. 
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it makes perhaps yet little difference. 
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty in every test played and was was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs, it however Paul Collingwood, at that time yet fighting for to consolidate itself, created that the breakthrough to an important Testkricketspieler and that although it still is underestimated a double hundred against Australia in Australia punktete, perhaps. 
Is probable that Graveney, Vaughan and bog will follow, after a further discussion in the course of the current network session in the Asgiriya stage its conservative instinct and belly feeling practical larger for Shahs knowledge of Boparas youthful enthusiasm. 
There are arguments for both. 
For Shah, its twinkling and valuable 88 test-debut-Innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara that at 22 years of age seven years is younger, and an excellent balance against turned on rolling speaks. 
But Shah made was healthy only ten Runs in its two Innings in the May against west Indies in the test in lord, its homeland arenas as a player out of Middlesex, and this, plus its immediate rejection of the selections as a Vaughan in order to turn back its position for the next game, seems taken the momentum out of its striking to have, that was obvious yet in Bombay. 
In contrast to that the all-rounder has joie de vivre out of Essex by the shovelful. 
It is impressed of nothing on a Kricketplatz and was brought its bearing to one side of therefrom on the point when it had recently a vehicle with four wheel drive in a display for England sponsor Volkswagen Ã¼berschlagen. 
It suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first what it did, was its Vodafone (naturally also gesponsort) to get out and to call its team colleague Alastair Cook, to say that this had observed from a distance, and with enthusiasm: Do "you have that g sharp marriages?". 
Bopara is a much better field player, he kegelt its means speed with some effect here on the playing fields, what seems and strikes to fit to it with confidence and skill. 
To select the correct man a thing is, to select the correct moment another. 
Perhaps that is the actual art of the selection. 
I tend to give in addition Bopara now its chance, what does not mean, that Shah will stand there perhaps not yet well, if, how the tea sentence suggests from Ceylon, it that one is, that will play here this weekend.
