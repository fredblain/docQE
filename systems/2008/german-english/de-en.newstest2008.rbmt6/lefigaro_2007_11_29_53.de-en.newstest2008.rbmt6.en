Spectacular repair at the room station
More will have needed astronaut Scott Parazynski and its comrades of the garrison of the international room station (ISS) than seven hours in the space in order to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective sun collector, that is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific work on the station. 
A ventured exit, that to carry out based on its duration, that distance by inhabitable modules, that speed, with which it was organized and that of the astronauts tools, around the repair, several records obtained has. 
The problem appeared on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the room ferry Discovery, a zylinderförmiges part large that should receive soon the European and Japanese scientific Labore. 
This module is a type landing bridge for the module-Labore. 
But one must be able to furnish it with current. 
It was the second task of the garrison therefore, a 17.5 module heavy tons to the current production over sun collectors, that was already on the ISS, to transfer in order to bring it into its final position. 
After it had transferred it, the garrison at the restructuring of the sun collectors of the module whose chip expanse amounts to 76 meters made itself. 
And at the same time happened it that one of the collectors that can be unfolded like accordion was damaged, by a clamped cable on a length by approximately a meter
The restructuring was stopped in order to not to damage the collector yet more. 
The astronauts, who leave originally for a control gear the room ferry Discovery, and then another sun collector whose rotation system was defective, repair should, saw forced itself to dedicate itself to the damaged collector. 
And Scott Parazynski was selected, at the end of the 30 meter of long remote-controlled arm the room ferry, that had been mounted at that of the station, to walk around, in order to carry out the repair. 
It is one of the best (Wetraumgänger) of the NASA. 
Largely, resistant, very sent, has developed it one well torso and long arms. 
That 46-jähirige trained physician was selected therefore, the sun collector to. 
After it exactly had appraised the damages, it cut the defective cable and secured a type rails on the damaged place. 
It became remained of a second of that in the vicinity of the lock, supports, and, of inside, of the other astronauts, under them Peggy Whitson, commander of the garrison. 
The tool that it used, a mini hockey beater, with insulator wraps up, around on the sun collectors, that produce several hundred volts to prevent an electric blow, had devised the astronauts on board the station and. 
When the action was concluded, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector completely was unfolded, before it counted its tools and turned into the station back. 
Yesterday afternoon wetted the astronauts a half day relaxation before today seven astronauts turned on the room ferry Discovery back in order to begin presumably Wednesday the return flight to the earth.
