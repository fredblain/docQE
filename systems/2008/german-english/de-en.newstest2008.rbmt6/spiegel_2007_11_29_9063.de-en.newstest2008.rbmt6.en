Venus is the infernal twin of the earth
The Venus is thought in spite of its life hostile atmosphere of the earth more similarly than until now: The European space probe "Venus express" discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind turbulence at the Poland how they appear in the winter also on the earth. 
For almost three decades scientists have assumed that it flashes on the Venus. 
Now the European probe furnished "Venus express" the proof - it sensed electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere up: The flashes on the Venus shoot in a height of approximately 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "nature". 
Flashes have emerge let loudly the famous "Ursuppen-theory" life on the earth: Thunderstorms should have encouraged reactions in the ocean, that led to the development of amino acids, the building blocks of life. 
Not so on the Venus: "If it ever life there gave, must it in the very early story been its", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington. 
Today there would be allowed to be hardly something living on the surface of the Venus: The atmosphere is approximately hundred time poet as on the earth, it rule sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees. 
"The Venus is perhaps the devil twin of the earth, but it is a twin", said Russel. 
Why the Venus, that is so similar to the earth in mass and size, hit, a so completely other development, the reason question of the Esa-mission is. 
The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 a milestone was for the Venus-research because since beginning of the nineties no more probe was expressly to the investigation of this planet underway. 
The newest research results, that are introduced now "nature" in several -articles, underline in the opinion of the researchers not only the uniqueness of the Venus within the solar system. 
"You show also, that the commonalities of our neighbor planet with the earth more largely are than first of all supposed", divides the Esa with. 
So the researchers found also a cloud swirl next to the already well known turbulence wind at the north pole at the south pole, that revolves yet substantially faster. 
The phenomenon reminds one of air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a researcher team around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica. 
The two most internal planet of the solar system has almost the same mass such as the earth and is almost just as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers. 
The planet designated also as morning star or evening star circles in almost 225 days around the sun. 
He revolves however much more slowly around itself: A Venus day lasts 243 earth days. 
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees centigrade and a pressure reminds one of 92 cash hardly of the earth, scientists assume that both planets emerged under entirely similar prerequisites. 
On both, water gathered, that remained on the earth in oceans, on which Venus got lost however in the space. 
And during carbon dioxide on the earth in carbonate rock fixed is, makes it on the Venus the large part of the atmosphere from.
