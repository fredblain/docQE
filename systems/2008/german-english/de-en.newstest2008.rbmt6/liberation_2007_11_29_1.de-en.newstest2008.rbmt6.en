That it gave a Teddybären a name, was shown it today a court in Khartum. 
According to its lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused in the Sudan because of offense of the Islams, was convicted, on Thursday evening of a court in Khartum to 15 days custody and subsequent from direction. 
The Briton was accused to have permitted six-year until seven year old students, to give a Teddybären the name Mahomet although each representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited. 
It would have earned it to be flogged. 
After parents of students had burdened themselves repeatedly in the Sudanese ministry of education and cultural affairs, became the 54-year-old elementary school teacher, that was active at the Unity High School of Khartum, on Sunday with itself at home taken up and accuses after articles 125 of the Sudanese punishment code of the offense the Islams. 
Actually this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher requests its six-year until seven year old student to choose a name for the Klassenteddy. 
Children propose eight names, under that Hassan, Abdullah and reports training leader Robert Boules. 
In the end, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children Mohammed select as a dearest first name. 
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a first name very frequent in the Sudan. 
Subsequently the children generated a book for the class, with which photo of the bear is on that and the picture signature name. 
The bear itself carried no sign with this name, but the problem is entirely simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is looked at as an offense of the Islams. 
One of the Moslem colleagues of Gillian gibbons, that instructs at the same school in the Sudan, explained, would know would have done would have he it good, and it never something wherewith it could step a religious belief to nearly, regret itself acts only that it the children asked, for a name to its considering it herewith only around one. 
An opinion that numerous students of the teacher divide who never describe this as attentive vis-à-vis its and as that in the class over religion. 
Consider that the first name Mohammed of simultaneously also that in Great Britain is at the second most frequent given two name, for which in the English 14 different letter manner exist. 
This first name selected often by Moslem families counts as a type Ehrerbietung at the prophet (it becomes frequently the first-born of a family given). 
But how do the rules in the reference read on the use of this first name? 
May one give it for example a toy? 
This is obvious a question of the interpretation.
