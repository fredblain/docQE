The climate on the Venus could recognize let an outlook on the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a comfortable place for life, said scientist yesterday. 
Data of a spaceship present European on an orbit show that the planet is similar a turned away twin of the earth to yet more, than was previously aware. 
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth. 
Both worlds possess approximately the same size and have is similar planetary orbits, to be sure the Venus of the sun somewhat nearer. 
Before billions of years would have ruled on the Venus conditions, that very similarly, to which on the earth been would be and even inhabitably can be would have, believe scientist today. 
But because of the unimpeded carbon dioxide-greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere through sun irradiation and a slower rotation speed the Venus hit an entirely other development course. 
Today the planet of water is robbed and has is a surface temperature, that hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winding and flash storm. 
The insights of the space probe Venus express of the European space flight agency, that has planned examined that for a year, offer a sobering view on that how the earth could develop in view of of that climate changes catastrophic. 
Professor Fred Taylor of the department physics at the university Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus express mission, said: "It becomes itself clear why the climate is on the Venus so different to that of the earth, during the planets otherwise rather similarly sind." 
"Our new data enable it, a scenario to construct, in which the Venus before billions of years such as the earth begun has, possibly with an inhabitable environment."
