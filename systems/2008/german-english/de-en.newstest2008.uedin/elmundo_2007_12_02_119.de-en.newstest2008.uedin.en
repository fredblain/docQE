What is the best insurance for me?
The motor vehicle insurance covering a potential disaster caused by drivers, wiederrum contains a high cost, whose level of various factors, etc., depends, among other things, of their age, sex, the drawing up of the driving licence, marital or family status, the nature of the insured cars and its use,
To have a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate motor vehicle insurance as the right Fahrzeugmodell.
First of all, there must be a clear that what we are dealing with here.
A mine is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholders.
This agreement will be written by means of a contract, which is to establish that society will the agreed Versicherungsprämie and committed in return to submit the appropriate Abfindungssumme when a disaster.
The Versicherungsprämie is the cost of insurance, which is made up by several factors, including their age, sex, the drawing up of the driving licence, marital or family status, type of vehicle insured or use.
The insurance companies are setting their prices in line with the statistics, so that higher contributions are also due to a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, must both on 25-year-old children and women less contributions, because statistics show that these groups with a smaller accident rate, thanks to their caution.
The same also applies for married people, since these are, according to the statistical values and therefore also convinced that the companies to fewer accidents as Alleinstehende.
The benefits which is attached to the vehicle, affect the frequency and hence also the probability of an accident.
The more the use, the more likely the damage.
In the drafting of the insurance premium a whole series of points must be taken into account.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation carefully, precisely in order to select the mine that responds to his personal needs.
At this point we statistics now are the most important points which we should learn in the selection of insurance, in order to be able to not only efficient but also a make price-oriented choice.
The 25-year-olds to take on the choice of cheap insurance to many obstacles, such as, for example, the poor and the young   driving licence.
Even if it would be an ideal cover for the best to conclude a Vollkaskoversicherung, however, there are cheaper alternatives.
The tentative drivers can select Vollkasko with an exemption, so that the benefits of a Vollkaskoversicherung be covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of treaty means that the consumer has to pay a part of the damage incurred by the amount.
 The amount will be set before the end of the Treaty and on the basis of the amount of Versicherungsprämie and it is the smaller the  higher to bezahlende sum, Luis Noguera, main exponents of Spain in First declared Europe, a Vermittlungsunternehmen for online insurance.
The other option is the enlarged insurance, the insured against external Unfallschäden customers, but not on their own car incurred damage.
Furthermore, it would cover this type of insurance theft, fire and Fahrzeugverlust.
There is a Council.
If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hands, to reduce the costs of insurance; increase your credit advice by versuchst to drive carefully and to prevent accidents.
A credit advice is a reduction in the basic standard tariff in the insurance company.
On the contrary, a Strafzahlung implies an increase in the tariff will be applied.
The amount  credits and total penalty depends on the society and their returns.
If the company has a good year behind it, it can  allow itself to increase the no-payment Noguera, explained.
As soon as the 25-year-threshold is exceeded, it is easier to conclude a treaty for the drivers. Reason for this is the fact that the accident rate is falling, with growing driving.
It is therefore best to opt for a Vollkaskoversicherung with excesses.
Normally vote  young people can derive any benefit from their experience, both  in the event of an accident and not at the time of the well explained to the Spanish Vorsteher of European company, and adds that the majority of accidents in the second Praxisjahr after the  fear of Anfängers  has been given.
Nevertheless, it is possible for a married customers, which is not to conclude children, better, a Vollkaskoversicherung; of course, it is only the financial situation of the person in question.
From the insurers are married couples with children as customers, with the lowest accident rate, and correspondingly low for their contributions.
In this case, with an exemption would be Vollkaskoversicherung (with an amount to EUR 300), the best option, in the event that it has received a high credit advice, an enlarged insurance, which is only the third Fahrzeugjahr recommends.
As a whole more relaxed  you go and have a greater purchasing power, the  it allows them to a higher contributions, notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is with a Vollkaskoversicherung exemption () in order to a sum of EUR 150, or conclude an enlarged insurance, which uses only when a sufficiently high credit advice.
In the end, it is necessary to point out that the mine something very important, not only because it protects the driver Unfallschäden against potential, but also because it entails high costs, making it necessary that a thorough choice is made, which is in line with our personal situation.
