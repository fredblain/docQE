Budget is by
Yes, it is achieved.
The state budget is adopted.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget of the government has drafted, and which was adopted without the support of the opposition by the Koalitionsmehrheit.
The for the current year, has been with the support of the Social Democrats ČSSD (approved), because it had submitted Minister Sobotka (by this party) and the ČSSD it could not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government nothing drastic happened this time.
The Congress approved this traditionally little known, however, highly significant law calmly.
To a certain extent, this is a paradox.
Everything governance begins and ends with the individual chapters of the budget and, whether we like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is for the media a dankbareres issue, and that is why they devote more attention.
A dispute among politicians for the public is much more interesting than sobering figures.
The Member States have suffered in the last Socialist governments under three weaknesses, which cannot eliminate the budget for the year 2008 at once:
The first is the high percentage of expenditure, which is due by law, but it is not just about pensions, but also about spending, which adopted the 'tacit' coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) in the last year before the elections.
The second is the budgetary deficit as a result of the first Schwachpunkts.
The third restriction in the deficits of public finances, in other words the public deficits of local communities.
The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and eingermaßen under control.
It is a veritable time bomb the budget deficit of local communities.
Many mayors gave to open up out of revenue from tax, levies and bank lending further sources for investment, often bond thoughtlessly by their halls in excess indebted.
In recent years, it was to pay this debt by massive selling shares of the energy and other networks which they had received in train the privatisation of state.
Now this source is already dried up.
As far as we keep to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
Our economy for a number of years, as the rest of the world, is going through a period of growth, which prides itself on the ČSSD without constantly.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the state-induced these governments, but more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have spent much more sensible than our Republic.
That is a great shame, which is mainly due to the former governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, threatened least of poverty.
This is why no nassiven social programmes are needed, which have been blown up in recent years, unfortunately, quite unnecessarily in record time scale.
Even if it is a part of the absurd populist expenditure, which were adopted this year, before the elections, to remove, it is clear that if it is not in the near future, to an increase in the retirement age and to a reform of pensions, then ends practically any policy in this country, and, regardless of who is in power, he will remain nothing more than a mere government.
It is only a slight exaggeration if we say that from the politicians, officials, which divide the bulk of the tax revenues mechanically on pensions and social spending.
That is why this year's budget is not a revolution, but it can only put an end to the displacement of normal expenditure by Pflichtausgaben.
The scheduled for 2008 deficit of 70 billion kronor would be superfluous if previous governments would not have been spent in the last ten years, which was only.
If we do not want it really comes to mere administrators from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government which is aware, however, that the state can only spend as much as it is to take on taxes and charges in the situation, calm in the preparation for further reform laws.
This will enable a gradual implementation of a balanced budget.
