Holiday season are not
In Hungary so that the practice of Umdisponierens of working days has become established around the Christmas holidays are regulated by law in the meantime, however, the coming year shows us less these days.
Also in the EU and in America something else we understand by 'holiday'.
The Hungarian legal system to distinguish between Staatsfeiertagen and labour-free days.
Arbeitsfreie days are mostly church holidays or are with major historic events in context.
For example, we are celebrating New Year: both the last day of the old, as well as from the first day of the new year are labour-free days - the latter alone, so that the New Year's Eve-Feiernden sit.
Throughout the year, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The Staatsfeiertage are the 15 March, which is reminiscent of the 1848 revolution, and of 23 October, the day of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August is the formation of a state, on 1 May, the work celebrated, on 1 and 2 November we remember our deaths.
In addition, there are two holidays to Easter, Pfingsten and Christmas.
Since our Heads of State, national or religious holidays are rarely on a weekend, the practice of 'working day-postponement' has proved its worth in the cases in which we would work before or after the holiday just one day.
The price of extended weekends is, however, that we have to work against the Samstagen very well, or go to school.
When this day, before or after the holiday, should be dealt with at the end of the day, will be set by the ministers for many years in a regulation of our own.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, for public equally employees and officials of the public service.
With the exception of companies and institutions, in which the operation without interruption, will continue in the holidays, are only.
This is the only by working order at the end of the year the holidays rather confused, from 24 December, life will formally here at home, because most of the days Zeitausgleich between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or has been abolished for holidays.
In the next year, more holidays in the Wochenmitte, or at the end of the week, so that there will be less Umdisponierungen during the days when this year.
The calendar will first of all around the day of work 'to', so that people can remain the same four days in a row at home.
Saturday, 26 April will be a working day, so that the Friday, 2 May will be a day of rest.
The second re-planning is connected with the holiday on 23 October, on Saturday, 18 October, we will have to the Friday 24 October through beforehand.
The end of the year, however, will be completely in the sign of holidays, are all from 24 December, and are even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
