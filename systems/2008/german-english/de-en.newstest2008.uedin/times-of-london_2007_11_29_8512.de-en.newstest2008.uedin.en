England faced with decision on the statements made by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who is going to propose a No 6 for Kandy England in this weekend Owais or Shah Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, Wahlvorsitzende to call at least under this specific title, is here, to decide, in order to help the Cheftrainer Peter Michael Vaughan Moores and the captain, and because the table of high Morries, the English executive director, is gradually filling up with applications for national Wählerämter, if not even for what part-time work.
Anyone who has not always the sixth Schlägerposition will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport is without doubt it.
It is never easy to apply exactly what a person at the top of its Berufszweiges, while someone else will never, on the lowest status, sometimes due to a lack of good will.
It is not only in the cricket, where the choice is difficult, where decisions are needed, which are always at the end of subjective.
Is it the right time to forge ahead Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he is doing this?
The same may be needed in a further area if, for example, John Edwards or 'Tubby' Banerjee, both intelligent young managers should be promoted with good qualifications are familiar with the business.
Who can say what the right class, is for a cricketers, unless it is given the opportunity to swim or submerged.
Of course, numbers have a major influence on decisions, but also have opportunities.
Within a team a cricketers must catch the eye of the master of the ship at the right time, if he can take a Wicket and a bat regular opportunities must be given in order, if he wants to make as a one-day cricketers impression.
To catch the eyes of the Auswähler is more complicated.
There were many who in the last season better than, for example, as James Anderson, apparently, which will be the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared itself for healthy and as the wind kegelt in the networks.
Anderson, 32 a first-class Wickets with 33 Runs in order to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their high points and hope to even more.
Or whether Shah Bopara Asgiriya plays in stage, can only be a Ansichtsfrage.
The election could decide the careers of both men, or perhaps it makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in each test and has been successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs but that it was Paul Collingwood, then kämpfend to consolidate, managed to a significant breakthrough Testkricketspieler and, even though he punktete a dual hundred against Australia in Australia, perhaps still underestimated.
That will probably Graveney, Vaughan Moores and, after a further discussion in the context of the current Netzsitzung Asgiriya stage in its Conservative instincts and Bauchgefühl Shahs will follow for more experience on Boparas young enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
He speaks for Shah funkelnden and valuable 88 test-debut-Innings in Mumbai, 43 first-class Bopara hundreds and only six of the seven years younger with 22 years, and an excellent record against angedrehtes bullets.
But Shah only ten Runs in its two Innings against the West Indies in May on the test in Lord, its Heimatarena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus the immediate rejection of the Auswählern than Vaughan healthy was to withdraw his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum from his fighting, which was still in Mumbai.
On the contrary, the Alleskönner from Essex has schaufelweise vibrancy.
It is not a Kricketplatz impressed on the sidelines, and its attitude has come to the point, when he recently had a car with an exhibition Vierradantrieb Volkswagen sponsor of England.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was also, of course, be Vodaphone (gesponsort) and its Teamkollegen Alastair Cook, monitoring of this from a distance and enthusiastically to say: "Have you seen? '.
Bopara is a much better Feldspieler that he be kegelt Mitteltempo here with some effect on the playing fields, which seems to fit to him and proposes with confidence and skill.
To choose the right man one thing to choose the right moment is another.
Perhaps that is the real art of choice.
I am inclined to give his chance Bopara now, which does not mean that will be left Shah may not be a good idea if he is the person who, as the Teesatz from Sri Lanka suggested, play this weekend.
