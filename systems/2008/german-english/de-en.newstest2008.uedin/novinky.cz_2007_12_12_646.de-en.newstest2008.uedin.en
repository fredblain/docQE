Test Peugeot 207 SW 1 (6) VTi: Voruteile dwindling
To tell the truth, I have never been a particular fan of the Peugeot 206.
His Fahreigenschaften were not worth very much, the quality of Gangschaltung, the control and processing could be termed rather below average.
Now, however, his successor, is the Peugeot 207, on the market, and which is much better.
With the name of the Kombi SW is still a bit, and it only remains for me to change my mind.
When I had the classic Hatchback tested the 207, I had to complain about me, for example, about the low Kopffreiheit on the Hintersitzen.
These complaints, there is now no longer, because if the Kombi is designed in such a way that not even Zweimetermänner.
Further to quickly
I shall go through the interior decorating only briefly in order not to repeat myself.
It is a rather successful design, where I have only because of the meagre Mitteltunnels objections.
I would welcome a little more designerische design, where the car is otherwise such an elegant impression.
The seats are convenient, and over the times are, where we may be a line no longer exists, or to brief seats.
Also the Seitenhalt has been substantially improved 206.
With regard to the space, we can also feel the compounded here the dimensions.
The Kombi, which I mentioned earlier, the lack of Kopffreiheit is also removed.
In the boot suitcase
The most important thing in this car is but the Laderaum.
(I must also because of the aufklappbaren Rückfensters) as a very good and describe beladbar platzsparend.
The Hohlräume are equipped with Haltegurten, which constitute a perfect compromise.
They do not disrupt, I consider it apart and also more severe objects.
But we have been talking about the Ladevolumen.
It is according to the table in the basic 428 litre, which is a more competition in relation to the average value.
We do not, however, in comparison with the best selling car in the Czech Republic, this category, the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we see that Peugeot falls to show signs of 52 litre.
For a Auslandsurlaub or the Einladen Kinderwagens of this value is already critical.
But I would like to emphasise the Positiva, I must mention the following the belt Umklappen the very shallow Laderaum or even the very low Ladekante.
120 PS in four ranks
Our Testwagen was equipped with a Vierzylinder-Benzinmotor included 1.6 litres and with an output of 88 KW.
And, quite frankly, a 1 600-Kubik-engine should take the drives a families-Hatchback.
He is quiet, has a low consumption and is well away.
If I compare this with his counterpart in Skoda that works sometimes as would be a vehicle exhaust pipe Lappen, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
The price speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly volkstümlich.
We must remember, however, that we have tested a well-funded car with a geräumigen Innneren and a very good driving force.
The basic price of cars with the 1400er Benzinmotor of SEK 329900 is.
With our driving force it costs SEK from 410900, which is already quite a lot.
The funding of the premium Testwagens proposes once again with an extra SEK 80000 annually.
We had however Kopfairbags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic Scheibenwischerauslösung, electrical Fensterheber and and...
So the car is costing a total of SEK 531900 simple.
That is a lot, but you calculate the increase of a Fabia and you will arrive in a very similar amount.
Therefore, all that remains is the decision as to which we want to choose brand.
