These are not Warhols cases
Anyone who combines the concepts of Sweden and Holzkiste, thinks of Ikea, but not in Andy Warhol.
Or it?
Currently, in Sweden fabrizierte Holzkisten cast dark shadow over Warhols Werkverzeichnis.
A large proportion of the vierundneunzig Brillo boxes listed in the 'type Stockholm' are counterfeiting.
After the Swedish newspaper 'Expressen' a few months ago, doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhols has fuelled Brillo boxes of 1968, internal investigations in Moderna Museet in Stockholm now to a sobering result: the six 'Brillo-boxes' which the former Museumsdirektor Pontus Hultén the Moderna Museet 1995 Hungary Constantine, copies are - and I think the majority of around one hundred further Brillo boxes' the type of Stockholm ', which are on the international art market.
The background is verschachtelt, a confusing string of artistic and kuratorischer productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York, his first 'Brillo-boxes' bemalte Holzkisten based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard Seifenpulvers' Brillo '.
His work in an exhibition Moderna Museet from 1968 was - Warhols agreement, with hundreds of Brillo-from cardboard boxes: these reasons) (were not Warhol, but they have been impossible to directly from the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik.
It was not a question of works of art, but whose models, a mere exhibits.
At the same time, probably in 1968 Warhol has given permission to produce a few Brillo-Holzkisten in Sweden, which have not been issued in Moderna Museet.
All witness to speak now about fifteen boxes, which are then as authorised original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-boxes with the term 'type Stockholm' right in the art and Auktionsgeschichte.
Some of them have achieved at auctions more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that the legendary Museumsdirektor Pontus Hultén wrongly claimed later, be it produces around one hundred Holzkisten 1968 in Sweden and has been issued, the Warhol then have to leave him.
In fact, 105 cases have been Hulténs produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
At this time it was three years Warhol dead.
Lars Byström, Chefkonservator on Moderna Museet, in addition to the six museum own Brillo-boxes three examined from the Swedish privately, two of which have been carried out in 1968 in Stockholm: their Pressspanplatten grundiert abgeschmirgelt were first and then, white Ölfarbe was entrusted with a Pinsel.
The structure of the copies from 1990 against reveals that the colour was entrusted with a Malerrolle without Grundierung directly to the Pressspanplatte - it is not a question of oil, but Acrylfarbe.
'This cases have not been authorised by the artists and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-boxes ", the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, said:' If the 'Andy Warhol type Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will define the six cases in its collection as copies / Ausstellungsmaterial. '
In July, the Authentication Board has announced to investigate the serious accusations', in terms of the Seifenpulver-boxes.
But since then, it remains unerbittliches in silence.
