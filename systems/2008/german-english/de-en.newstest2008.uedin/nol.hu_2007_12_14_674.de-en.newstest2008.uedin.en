Political plans: Hungarian guard Staatsrisiko increased
In the view of the department for risk analysis Analysing) (Risk-division of political action plans in this August, with the support of the 'movement for a better Hungary' formed Hungarian guard have increased the risk of Hungary and of the region in several respects.
In the 'Risikowarnungs report' of the Institute it means, among other things: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk is the 'tightening up of the existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and non-Zigeunerbevölkerung in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term.
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, probably at the provocation of a dispute of this kind, the one.
As has already been mentioned, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "persons of public life have left to the discussion of the Roma issue representatives of radical political groups who have built their political strategy on the Roma Hungary-contrast '.
It is believed that this aggravate the problem, make the sensible dialogue impossible, would benefit foot injuries, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The Forschungsinsitut ausserdem believes that the activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, 'damaging the image of Hungary abroad, particularly as regards the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity'.
Let us remind ourselves that, since the autumn of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary is constantly on the rise, so that 2007 several since summer, founded 'national Selbstverteidigungsverein' ablaze organisations.
'these groups have in common is that they be defined in each case as a civil organisation, while about them openly to prepare their members to - sometimes armed - civil defence tasks, defence, Ordnungshütung), by invoking the ineffectiveness of the police, the army, or to the state itself (', '.
And further: all of this is in accordance with the method which tried to disguise different, to the political and Parteiverdrossenheit the population-based, political aspirations as civil initiative.
The emphasis on the civilian nature and the Vereinsform serve not just the circumvention of legal obstacles, which could in the wake of the registration appear in court - it is also a political strategy.
As suggested in the analysis of the activities of the Hungarian guard constitute a risikoerhöhenden factor for the relations with neighbouring countries.
In recent months, the Hungarian guard was quoted in several of its neighbours as a potential source, some ultra-nationalist politicians in certain countries of the creation of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian-policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region '-'.
From the point of view of the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian guard not into East in central Europe, so the political risk has grown for the region as a whole.
As has already been mentioned, the activities of the Hungarian guard are Bulgarischen comparable with those of the National Guard, whose establishment in August 2007 has announced by the extreme right-wing Bulgarischen National Union (BNU).
In the light of the emergence of the Bulgarian guard the Roma Massenausschreitungen that have taken place in a regeneration of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has noted the incidents in the same way as the basis for establishing the Guard, with the argument that the aim of the organisation is the 'national protection'.
In their view, was in the last 17 years a genuine 'Zigeunerterror' in Bulgaria, the government has, however, remained indifferent and - as political plans.
And further: the initiative of contract had a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I have said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is shown by the fact that some of the Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to Widerstandszwecken to set up their own guards.
Since the activities of the Hungarian guard so far shows many similarities with which the Bulgarischen Guard it is not to exclude that the Hungarian Roma react with the Organisieren their own protection to the threats, it says in the case of political Risikowarnungsbericht plans.
Attila Juhász, Forschungsdirektor in political plans said on the question of the report: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the Forschungsinstitutes.
Every year, would be published Risikoanalyseberichte and risk-changing tendencies should be clear, public opinion will be kept informed, as in the case of the publication of the Risikowarnberichtes.
