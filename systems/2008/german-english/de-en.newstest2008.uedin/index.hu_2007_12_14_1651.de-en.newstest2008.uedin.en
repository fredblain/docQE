In many places Desinfektionsmitteln cuts in
Today, more than a thousand have been registered infections in hospitals, which were due to the improper use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding in the beds, congestion of staff, factors which are not conducive to combat the infection, the chief doctor of the National Epidemiologiezentrums.
Cuts are being made in many places in the Desinfektionsmitteln.
In the Traumatologie-department of a hospital János MRSA-infection has recently been diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant pasteurisation has been found in a male patients, was taken after a serious accident to hospital.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection.
The injured a serious car accident was released from the hospital, shortly afterwards, the man who had to return with a MRSA-infection. An important operation could be because of the Bakteriums since that is still in the body of the patients, carried out.
Until 10 December this year to the National Nosocomialis infections generated from hospitals 1094 by multi-resistant strains reported Surveillance System, the chief doctor of the National Epidemiologiezentrums, Karolina Böröcz.
So many, through multi-resistant strains caused infections were to be registered in the hospitals in security, but the number of unreported cases is higher.
Approximately two-thirds of the infection (683 cases) the MRSA, triggered against Methicillin-Oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The pasteurisation Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is approximately one-third of people in their nose, without it would cause a disease.
SA-related infections (such as Halsentzündung, Mandelentzündung, inflammations of skin or wounds) usually respond to antibiotics, they are good it can be cured.
However, the funds be extent too high or inadequately applied, antibiotic-resistant, which are under appropriate conditions in the hospitals quickly arise from the good respondierenden bacteria.
Particularly in patients with geschwächtem, or permanently bad funktionierendem immune system, but also in older, or patients with little weight these bacteria can serious infections, such as Blutvergiftung Wundinfektion or, in other words Sepsis.
The head of the medical János hospital, the MRSA-infection is nothing special that such incidents are Krankehausalltag.
We should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte Tibor MRSA Nyulasi - there are not only there, where they will not be sought.
Become resistant to antibiotics
'such patients are isolated, and health care personnel bears Gummihandschuhe and masks of supplies, and we have the necessary for the treatment of antibiotics' - so Tibor Nyulasi.
In its Einlieferung hospital patients to be investigated MRSA, however, not always an infection can be avoided.
Rarely Probenentnahmen to
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals, would be avoided, however, the current conditions and conditions are unfavourable to the control of the creation or the spread of the virus multi-resistant, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection in hospitals and Altersheimen occurs, should the eingelieferten Spitäler MRSA-infected patients investigate and isolate immediately.
In the Hungarian hospitals microbiological practice not, however, being so often.
Not least because it on the part of the state Krankenkasse, no subsidies for this study.
The majority of cases, therefore, only then will come to light, if a patient is already a bemerkbare MRSA-infection, the head of the medical Epidemiologiezentrums.
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Antibiotic treatments should be targeted, that is to say, microbiological studies are necessary, so that there are no resistance against the resources, however, this directive will be respected by hospitals, not always.
Under the ambulanten, or in the service of the patients microbiological Probenentnahmen are even less so Karolina Böröcz.
In the Desinfektionsmitteln savings
Scientific evidence demonstrates that MRSA patients from one to the other will be entrusted to most of nursing staff.
That is precisely why the Händewaschen, or the wearing of gloves and masks is of great importance, however, there are also serious shortcomings in this area in the hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted through Tröpfcheninfektion or contact in the domestic hospitals do not always have the possibility, however, to isolate the infected patients.
The rooms are often overcrowded, ranked the beds close to each other, although it should be epidemiological point of view between them from a distance of at least 1.5 metres.
As Karolina Böröcz points out, it is, unfortunately, in the less well financially the hospitals even that savings would be made on Desinfektionsmitteln, there are few managers, many patients - all factors that encourage the emergence of infection.
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequently, or can be stopped the further spread of the virus, where these protective measures are complied with, Karolina Böröcz.
Emphasising MRSA against
MRSA-infections to manage the health insurance caused enormous costs, so they will be combatted everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or their containment was recorded in the legislative programme.
After the first signs of the programme is successful, as publizierte show data, the trend of MRSA-infections in England is falling.
The European Centre for disease prevention (ECDC)), the prevention of the creation of multi-resistant cause (including MRSA, and the prevention of diseases in hospitals to one of its priorities.
