To this end, that it has given a Teddybären a name that she was today, a court in Khartoum.
For the British teacher their lawyer, which was charged in Sudan because insult of Islam, has been sentenced on Thursday evening, by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion.
The British have been accused, as long as six to seven-year pupils to have allowed to give the name of a Teddybären Mahomet, even though it is prohibits any presentation of the Islamic chaos.
It would have to be deserves contempt.
After parents had complained of pupils in the Sudanese Kultusministerium several times, was the 54-year-old Grundschullehrerin, which was in the Unity High School of Khartoum, taken up on Sunday at home and under Rule 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code of Islam accused the insult.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher in their calls for as long as six to seven-year pupils, select a name to the Klassenteddy.
 The children are proposing eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohamed , Robert Boules headmasters.
Finally, as the class votes, choose 20 of 23 children Mohammed rather than first names.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Mohammed, but also and above all a in Sudan very frequent first name.
Subsequently, the children have produced a book for the class, with the photograph of the bears out and the Bildunterschrift  my name is Mohammed .
The bear itself was not a shield with this name, but the problem is, quite simply, that the presentation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as insult of Islam.
One of the Muslim fellow Members that Gillian Gibbons, informed on the same school in Sudan, said that he knew it well, and they would never have done something, and they could enter a religious faith to  I only regret that it has asked the children to vote for a name , its opinion, it is only a   innocent mistakes.
An opinion which share a number of pupils teacher, describe this as  very carefully and to their pupils   person who never speaks in the class  about religion.
It should be noted that the first name Mohammed is, at the same time, the second most in Great Britain's Zweitname exist for the 14 different Schreibweisen in English.
This often by Muslim families selected forename is regarded as a sort of the prophet (it is often given the Erstgeborenen a family).
But, as the rules with regard to the use of this Vornamens be?
Should we, for example, give him a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
