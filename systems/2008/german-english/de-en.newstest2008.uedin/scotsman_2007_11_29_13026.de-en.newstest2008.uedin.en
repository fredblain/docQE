The climate of Venus could see a glimpse of the future of the earth can
The Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, scientists have said yesterday.
Data into orbit of European Raumschiffes show that the planet is a abgewandten Zwilling the world even more than was deliberately so far.
The Venus is the näheste planetarische neighbour of the planet.
The two worlds have approximately the same size and have similar Planetenbahnen, however, the Venus the sun is in a little more detail.
Billions of years before the Venus prevailed conditions, which would have been very similar to those in the world and could even be habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere with the sun and slower Rotationstempo Venus followed a very different Entwicklungskurs.
Today the planet is deprived of water and has an annual average surface temperature to melt, which is heiss enough, lead and has been devastated by hurricane-strong winds and Blitzstürmen.
The findings of the spacecraft Venus Express the European Space Agency, which has examined the planet for one year, offer a sobering look at how the earth could develop in view of the disastrous effects of climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the department of physics Oxford University, one of the head of the mission Venus Express, said: 'It is clear why the climate of Venus is so different to the earth, while the planet are very similar otherwise'.
'Our new data, it will be possible to devise a scenario in which the Venus began billion of years as the earth, possibly with a bewohnbarer environment'.
