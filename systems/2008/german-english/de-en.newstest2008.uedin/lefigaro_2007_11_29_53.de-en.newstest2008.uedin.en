Spectacular things to the space station repair
An astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades of the crew of the international space station (ISS) will have more than seven hours in space needed to carry out the spectacular repair a defective Sonnenkollektors for the continuation of the scientific work on the station is essential.
A risky withdrawal, because of its duration, the removal of bewohnbaren modules, the speed with which he has been organised and the  astronauts from the gebastelten  tools, to carry out the repair, has made several records.
The problem in came into force on Wednesday, when the astronauts Harmony had pushed the module by the Raumfähre Discovery, a great zylinderförmiges part that will soon be up and the European and Japanese scientific laboratory.
This is a kind of module Landungsbrücke for the module-laboratory.
But we must be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5 tonnes of heavy module on electricity Sonnenkollektoren, which was already on the ISS, to bring it in its final position.
Having put it, the crew on the restructuring of the Moduls Sonnenkollektoren, whose scope is 76 metres.
And it happened, that one of the thermal collectors, as auffalten Akkordeone has been damaged by a eingeklemmtes cable at a distance of about a metre
The restructuring was stopped to damage the Kollektor not even more.
The astronauts who should leave initially for a Kontrollgang the Raumfähre Discovery and repair then another Sonnenkollektor, whose rota system was flawed, felt obliged to address the damaged Kollektor.
And Scott Parazynski was selected, at the end of the 30 metres long arm of the remote-controlled Raumfähre that had been made to the station, to walk around, to carry out the repair.
He is one of the best  Spacewalker  (Wetraumgänger NASA).
Large, robust, in a very intelligent way, he has a well-developed long and restricts bare-backed building workers.
Of the 46-jähirige skilled doctor has been selected to    Sonnenkollektor violated the  operate.
Having assessed the damage, he by separated the flawed cable and hard on the damaged a kind of railways.
He was of a second  Spacewalker  who was in the vicinity of the channel, supported and, from inside the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, Kommandantin the occupation.
The tool that he used, a mini-Hockeyschläger umwickelt with Isolator to prevent the Sonnenkollektoren, several hundred kV produce an electrical blow, had conceived the astronauts on board the station and   procedures.
When the action was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the Kollektor was fully aufgefaltet before he abzählte its tools and the station returned back.
Yesterday afternoon, enjoyed the détente astronauts half a day before today returned to the seven astronauts Raumfähre Discovery back to square up to Wednesday the return journey to the Earth.
