Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the price of the usual Budaörser Handelsdreieck Weihnachtskorbes has the 'Napi' also increased 16% this year, but in all Hypermärkten prices have been recorded over 1000 HUF.
After the prices in the Lebensmittelmärkten last December 'davongaloppiert', which is not prozentuell rise drastically, compared with the already high, former initial level.
However, it is intended as a deterrent to the consumer that what they had paid last year far below 9 000 HUF, this year, not even for 10, 000 HUF available.
The price of the 'Napi' Warenkorbs exceeded the magic 10 000-HUF-border at least 91 HUF investigated in the markets.
The high price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The price of fish were almost Unicum and living on Vorjahresniveau, greatly increased prices for Putenbrustfilets, and on the other hand, are Nuss poppy.
Prices for bread flour, and in line with the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, however, there have been Auchan 1kg Brotwecken for 139 Ft.
There was no competition-related decline in the product to below 200 Ft.
It is also surprising here two, the price of a litre of Coca-Cola Pfandflasche from 200 Ft was, therefore, including the drink deposit cost only HUF 257.
Nevertheless, this year in the 'Napi' Warenkorbs-comparison Auchan raised the most expensive, and Cora most favourable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora prices have in the 'Napi' shopping basket Weihnachtspreisen last year with the 15, while each Auchan Tesco and increased by 18%.
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of last year and this year was the most expensive of 12%, while the increase between billigstem shopping basket of last year and the current year teuerstem representing 21%.
The average price rises 1.480,00 HUF was.
The average increase in the last year was still 1.206,00 Ft, however, the Mehrwertsteuererhöhung price was last Christmas.
It is precisely this process has taken the trade furiously: it would seem that the Warenhäuser could not decide what Preisspanne should apply in the individual articles, since the effects of the increase in the consumption have incalculable.
(If the dealer does the circulation of a product bad, it can fall by a substantial profits in the Preisspanne, after the Verkehrsintensität.)
Mehwertsteuer-the rise of the 'Napi' Warenkorbes last year was so radical that the most expensive element was the value of 2006 by 1720 Ft exceeded, whereas the price difference in the cheapest merely basket 844 Ft.
This year, have not been observed such extremes, since the most expensive basket 1.630,00 Ft to cost more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest there was an increase of 1.284,00 Ft.
In comparison with the last two Weihnachtssaisons was a disastrous increase, the price of day-to-day consumer article in the Hypermärkten has risen in less than 20 months by more than 30%.
(confirmed this once again not necessarily the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic the Statistical Office in the period of 12 months, found a more than 30% rise.
So in addition to flour in around in eggs.)
However, you look into the 'Napi' shopping basket, it seems almost impossible to pursue, because the price level of last year expensive product itself has risen in the worst case, little more than 10%.
Obviously Mehllieferanten are in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten - after all, they were able to pass the drastic increase in prices to the multinationals.
In the golden Handelsdreieck aren't complain; it is constantly reported by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three Warenhäusern do not look more on prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, sustainable food goes on Paletten on the Ladentische.
Wednesday morning there was in all three Warenhäusern endless queues in the Kassa when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
Nevertheless, it is reported by the country a smaller Kundenfrequenz, so many multinationals in the Meinungsforschern complain that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, and not only in food, but also in sustainable consumer goods.
