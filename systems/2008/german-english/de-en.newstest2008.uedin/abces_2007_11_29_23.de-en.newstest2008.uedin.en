Klimapropaganda
Since the Klimadebatte both the sceptics of climate change, as well as those who put forward a social and political debate in the foreground, a merciless criticism review, the movement as whole a strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement to which, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, the fight against climate change is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new contract with the planet  .
However, this proposal will bring it in Erklärungsnot concerning the action, or non-action of his government, which has contributed significantly that Spain is within the EU at the top of the list of countries which have complied with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance with the rules on the sectors it is due, and why its government, which had proposed the  contract with the planet  has not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now having to explain the Spanish citizens of the planned measures against climate change, without hypocrisy.
What companies be affected, the kind of behaviour of the citizens should be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures must be carried out and what economic consequences will be.
To be more precise, who will pay sacrifice and the need to save the planet.
However, it has and in future, there will be no such statements.
It is precisely because it is: the Aufopfern and.
Because the measures that can be used against climate change in real terms, are unpopular.
They are cost-rich, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the PSOE proposed petrol-cent seemed Zapatero seen electoral strategically so dangerous that he has been forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is important now is to save the planet with nothing, in other words with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, committees and committees, protocols and new posts.
With its agreements with the planet for election campaigns of the appropriate politicians should not talk, denounce, calling for even, instead, the challenging issue but look to dress up the meeting with enthusiasm and with its gentle patience and kindness others.
But this will only happen if the Treaty does not diverted from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not claim that the bicycle in future will ease the only, or we must erfrischen only with a subjects.
