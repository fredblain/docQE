Is the vicious Venus Zwilling the world
Is the Venus, despite their live the earth's atmosphere hostile similar thought than we have up to now: the European spacecraft 'Venus Express' has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and Windwirbel in Poland, as they appear in the winter, also on the planet.
For almost three decades of scientists suggest that it blitzt on Venus.
Now the European probe 'Venus Express has shown - they sensed electromagnetic waves on the fringes of the atmosphere: the lightning Venus shoot at a level of around 56 kilometres of cloud to cloud, Christopher Russell reported by the University of California in Los Angeles in scientific magazine' Nature '.
According to the famous' Ursuppen theory 'lightning arise life on earth have: storm should suggested in the ocean reactions which have led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: 'If there has ever been life there, it must be in the very early history', Sean Solomon Carnegie declared by the institution in Washington.
Today, the atmosphere is around a hundred times more heavily than in the world should be there on the surface of the Venus barely alive: there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
'The Venus is perhaps the Teufelszwilling throughout the world, but it is a Zwilling' Russell said.
Why is the Venus, the earth in mass and size is a similar has taken such a completely different development, is the fundamental issue of the Esa-mission.
The launch of 'Venus Express' in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus-research, as was not probe since the beginning of the 1990s, specifically in the field of research into more of this planet.
The latest research which will be presented in a number of 'Nature' -Artikeln, underline the researchers are not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
'you also show that we have in common with our Nachbarplaneten are greater than the world's first adopted', shares the Esa.
The researchers in addition to the already well-known in the North Pole there have also been a whirlwind Wolkenstrudel on Südpol, is much more quickly.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of Luftströme on the abasing worldly Winterhemisphäre, writes a research team Piccioni by the Italian process by Giuseppe Di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second central planet the solar system has virtually the same as the earth and there is in diameter 12.100 kilometres almost as.
The planet Abendstern Morgen- or as described in less than five days ago under the sun.
It is, however, much slower themselves: a Venustag takes 243 Erdentage.
Although the Venus with Oberflächentemperaturen 460 degrees and a pressure from 92 reminds cash in the earth, researchers claim that both planet have arisen in very similar circumstances.
On both water collected, at the same time, in the oceans of the world, but on Venus was lost in the space.
And while carbon dioxide in Karbonatgesteinen fixated on the planet, from Venus it makes on the majority of the atmosphere.
