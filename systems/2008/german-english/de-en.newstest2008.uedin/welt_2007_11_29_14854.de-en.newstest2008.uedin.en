Richard Gere is simply not enough cynical
'The Hunting Party' and 'Mörderischer peace' two films deal with the war in the Balkans.
But both are not convincing.
Either the ideas put too much on Action and Geballer or sentimental but they are.
Since Richard Gere in 'The Hunting Party can not' help.
The good news first: it is true that the war criminals hide Karadzic and Mladic are still in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, now the actors Richard Gere has been found.
We had lost the most beautiful man of the 1980s least, because too many nice-irrelevant roles in Wohlfühlfilmen for women and too many press conferences on the subject of austrieben Buddhism, the desire for inspection.
Now all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument, The Hunting Party - if the hunters will 'Gejagten' (Why must always be those actually so long and confusing as driver-collective agreements?) perhaps look at.
It provides a wonderfully augenzwinkernde presentation: basically, be Kriegsreporter Simon Hunt is what has become of Gere if the destiny and the cinematographic sector would not be so gnädig: a man who has its very best for long periods, but as a monument to preserve its decline ruinen the same considerable vestiges of the former charm.
However, despite this Trumpfes The Hunting Party is', together with the German production 'Mörderischer peace', which is also, this week, only the endless series of failed Balkans war-films.
With 'Mörderischer peace' we can make short process: the film is of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), a Serbin before Kosovar Heckenschützen save what a love promptly in it.
Although it is a good thing that the Serbs are not only as the root of all evil, the fernsehflache film loses itself too quickly into Geballer and Action.
It is a kind of 'to sound the alarm for Cobra 11' without motorway but with war.
On the other hand, research is to 'The Hunting Party' is an example of why there has never actually been a true good Balkan Kriegsfilm.
The history of three US Kriegsreportern which seek to open the Serbian Oberkriegsverbrecher 'of the fox', with another director and another Drehbuchautor (both in one Richard Shepard) can at a different time perhaps a new 'Apocalypse Now'.
Because the stories are indeed striking: both times are small team in the forest, in order to achieve something which the military cannot and on both occasions there will be a trip to the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of 'The Hunting Party' is that we do not simply Simon Hunt the cynics can be run with heart when he will be presented to us at the beginning.
No, it must also Script andichten him a romantic affair, with a later Muslim Bosnierin murdered.
Ultimately 'The Hunting Party' then sold down the river, catch if the reporters within the last five minutes Zeitrafferverfahren succeed in what NATO, CIA Kopfgeldjäger and all the world have not achieved in five years: the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians for fair revenge.
This is so bad that we want to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik.
The film has a very human concerns.
It intends to denounce that Mr Karadzic and Mr Mladic still rumlaufen freely, and he suspected of the Americans and the French (here they are meant to be an exception and sometimes agreed) to promote the persecution on the grounds of secret political agreements not too.
But the good and evil Gemeinte are sometimes so similar to that is a famous Brecht-poem.
It says on the Holzmaske an Asian Dämons on the Arbeitstisch the poet: 'Mitfühlend I see the geschwollenen Stirnadern, andeutend: how demanding it is to be a bad'.
Films as' The Hunting Party 'have to be precisely for such Schwellköpfe which indicate but, as it is demanding.
The problem is not limited to the Genre of Balkankriegsfilms.
Recently, that all Iraq Hollywoods films were great Flops has been in this newspaper report.
We can add: there has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always applies: if a Star driving around on the trouble spots or minefields the world, then something is out, such as "Rangoon dismisses' with Patricia Arquette 'Jenseits all frontiers with Angelina Jolie or' blood diamonds' with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It may be that all the conflicts are simply time to close.
It has taken after decades before Hollywood could go with 'Schindlers list' a good film on the Holocaust.
Some film is mature may still be in force - the now as a classic Vietnam works' The Deer Hunter ',' Apocalypse Now 'or' full Metal jacket 'celebrated at the time are masterpieces as unanimously.
But perhaps we know today, where everyone is mass murder in real time on two screens at home also quite simply too much about the conflicts in the world.
And this is undermining the Drehbuchschreibern the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs to tell good stories.
'continued existence, or otherwise, of' or 'The great dictator' of course have become so much is because Lubitsch and still Chaplin did not know how serious the Nazi regime was genuinely.
Perhaps we should not want to be good, if we want to make good films.
Perhaps we must have the sarcasm Künstlerblick distancing of Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk.
As has been consulted on the parallels between its historical novel 'Lemprières dictionary' and the Balkan conflict, he said: 'It is only that there are a number of things which never change.
Cities will always be terribly dangerous, people are being murdered in horrifying way and there will be always war in Yugoslavia '.
