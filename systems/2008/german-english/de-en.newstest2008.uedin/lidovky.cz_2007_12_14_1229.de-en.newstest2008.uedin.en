Klaus: debates, the ecologists is quite incredible
Global climate change supposedly harm most developing countries.
President Vaclav Klaus once again to the problem of global warming.
The criticism referred to the coming to an end the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book 'A blue, green planet,' he said that the debates of the ecologists are quite incredible.
Klaus, not only the structure of the Conference is unacceptable, a strange mixture of government representatives of non-governmental organisations and such forms, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric which it has, and the reality of the situation.
'The debate is unstrukturiert, it is a Wortfeuerwerk, this is only a substitute for a real solution to the current problems, "said Klaus.
The Czech President emphasised in the presentation of his book that this issue is very important to him and that he is committed to this.
It is also expressed its satisfaction that his book appear in the German translation, because I am often 'cartoons of my views'.
Now unverzerrt interested parties could read its attitude.
Klaus reminded us that he is not a Klimatologe, but he was, in his opinion, adequate conditions, to write a book about this.
He was ultimately academics, able to understand and to assess the technical pamphlets, have experience of statistics and was also economist.
The main thrust of the book he described the theory that the climate is constantly changing and that it is therefore quite natural that it to global warming, no consensus view among researchers that the consequences of the current changes are not to be too large and seriously and therefore no threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate, superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable expensive.
In addition, he think it as someone who experience with totalitarian Sytemen have to impose unacceptable for other unproven views, to see this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On issues of repeated here, he said that he was not against 'a reasonable protection, but against militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between costs and yield.'
On the same issue had spoken Klaus two months ago in Vienna in Hayek Institute.
