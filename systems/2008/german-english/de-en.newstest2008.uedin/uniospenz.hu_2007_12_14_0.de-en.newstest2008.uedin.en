Hungarian Fodor and the six percentage points
As Minister for the Environment Gábor Fodor presentation, the meeting of experts on Tuesday at the end, and the debate on the international climate regime post-2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians discuss from 192 countries on the road map of Bali, in which the emissionsreduzierenden measures are laid down for the period after 2012, after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
At the moment, a heated debate between industrialised countries and developing countries is in progress.
The United States have already announced that they want to have concrete figures not negotiate, but it would be prepared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels by 25-40%.
The other major question the Conference is whether the industrialised countries are ready, apart from the reduction of emissions in the developing countries, both financially and to support technologically.
It has also been reached an agreement on the support of developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol has insinuated adjustment fund should be managed by a 16-köpfigen Council, probably in the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) of the UN, as in the 'Piac is recorded és profit'.
Six per cent of Hungary
The Environment Gábor Fodor supported on behalf of Hungary, the commitment of the EU to maintain its leading role in global climate protection measures, and to achieve a new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister has stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 (20% compared to 1990), irrespective of whether the 'agreement after 2012 will' made successful or not, and even the European Union would be prepared to commit itself to a 30% reduction soferne other large industrialized countries of the world, or developing countries are also prepared to comply with their obligations and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor emphasised that the objective of the Member States that have joined in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU had with their then 15 Member States already to a minus by 8%.
The target for Hungary is the reduction of greenhouse gases by 6% compared to the years of 1985-87 - a figure that will meet the country, as is widely reported in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali - which, after all, is the long-term international climate policy agreement has to be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly only after 2012 would enter into force, and in this case the Kyoto Protocol Reduktionsvorhaben not renewed, international Emissionsreduktionssystem, also stressed the importance of the IPCC, the international climate change by the Nobel Peace Prize excellent scientific Committee of the UN in its recent report.
This would delay the emission levels, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 ° C would be inevitable, which according to the Wissenschaftern extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
