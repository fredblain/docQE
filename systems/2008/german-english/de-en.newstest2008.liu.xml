<seg id="4"> In the budaörser trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas korbes of this year 'napi 16% have been increased, but in all hypermärkten over 1 000 huf price increases.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After the prices in the food markets in the last December 'davongaloppiert' the drastic rise will not prozentuell compared with the already high, former initial level.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, the consumer is intended to act as a deterrent, and that, in the last year far below 9 000 huf had paid for, this year, not even for 10, 000 huf is available.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The price of the 'napi' movement of korbs exceeded the magic 10.000-huf-grenze by at least 91 huf in the markets under scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The high price 10.573 huf fraud.</seg>
<seg id="9"> (in 6800 was the price in 6.800 huf.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The price of fish and living unicum remained almost at last year's levels have increased considerably, on the other hand, the price of putenbrustfilets poppy, and nuss.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Prices for meal and stick with the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, however, there have been auchan 1kg bread for 139 Ft can raise.</seg>
<seg id="12"> There was the product of competitive price tags fall to less than 200 Ft can.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Also surprising was here two, the price of a litre of Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 Ft can cost, thus including a drink cans huf only 257.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless, this year in the 'average' napi than warenkorbs- auchan at the most expensive, and cora most advantageous.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Our calculations have shown that the cora prices in the napi 'shopping basket' of the Christmas prices in the last year, around 15, while Tesco and each auchan by 18%.</seg>

<seg id="18"> The average price increase in the previous year in 1.206,00 Ft can still, however, the VAT mooted in the last Christmas prices.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Precisely this process has taken the trade seriously, it would seem that the movement of houses were difficult to decide what price margin in the individual articles should apply, since the effects of the increase in price on consumers were immense.</seg>
<seg id="20"> (if the traffickers the circulation of a product is a bad thing, it can come about substantial profits in the price range, following the transport intensity.)</seg>

<p>
<seg id="21"> The rise will mehwertsteuer- was caused by the 'napi' movement in the last year korbes so radical that the most expensive basket of the value of 2006 Ft can 1720 exceeded, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket 844 Ft can simply be fraud.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This year, these extreme not seen as the most expensive basket 1.630,00 Ft can, with more than in the previous year, and even in the cheapest, there has been a price increase of Ft can 1.284,00.</seg>

<seg id="25"> So in some alongside meal in eggs.)</seg>
<seg id="26"> However, if you look in the napi 'shopping basket', it seems almost impossible in respect of the latter, because the price level of the already expensive product in the previous year, even in the worst case, little more than 10%.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Obviously meal suppliers are in a stronger position than the eilieferanten - after all, they were the drastic price increase to the multinationals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> In the golden triangle of trade, aren't the hypermarkets starting; it will not constantly reported by good years.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Today, more than a thousand infections in hospitals, registered in an improper use of antibiotics were due.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the surfeit of personnel - the tide of all factors that are not necessarily the infections, such as the chief doctor of the national epidemiologie# centre.</seg>
<seg id="4"> It is widely used in the right.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the traumatologie- department of the jános hospital has recently been diagnosed in a mrsa- infection.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The antibiotic-resistant is possible in a male patients, found after a serious accident in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The patient is isolated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The people of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, the man who had, however, with a mrsa- infection, to return to an important operation since then, because of the bakteriums still in the body of the patients, is still not being carried out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> By 10 December of this year for hospitals 1094 resistant strains infections caused by multinationals in the national nosocomialis surveillance system, so to speak, the chief doctor of the national epidemiologie# centre, karolina böröcz.</seg>
<seg id="11"> So many resistant strains infections caused by multinationals in the hospitals have been registered with safety so that the number of unreported cases is higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Around two thirds of the infection (683 cases), the mrsa, against methicillin-oxacillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The staphylococcus aureus (SA) is possible, approximately one third of the people in their nose, without that it would cause a disease.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Sa-bedingte infections (such as hals#, entzündung almond, entzündung inflammations of skin or tend to react wounds) Well, they are well curable antibiotics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> However, the funds are too high or incorrectly applied extent, due to the good respondierenden antibiotic resistant bacteria, under appropriate conditions in the hospitals quickly.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Particularly in patients with geschwächtem, or for bad funktionierendem immune system, but also in the elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria serious infections, such as wund# infection or blood poisoning, therefore, sepsis.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="22"> Very rarely sampling</seg>

<p>
<seg id="24"> After this infection found in hospitals and retirement homes, which should examine the hospital with eingelieferten patients and isolate infected mrsa- immediately.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In the Hungarian hospitals, the microbiological samples but not so often.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Not least because on the part of the public health insurance fund is no support for this study.</seg>
<seg id="27"> The majority of cases, therefore, would only come to light the patient, if a bemerk# mrsa- infection, that has the medical head of the epidemiologie# centre.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="28"> On the part of the European Union, there are strict recommendations on the use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Antibiotic treatments will be targeted, that is to say, microbiological studies are necessary so that no resistance to the resources can be, however, this directive of hospitals, not always respected.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Under the ambulanten, or in the basic needs of patients are microbiological sampling, even less so karolina böröcz.</seg>
</p>

<p>
<seg id="32"> Scientific evidence demonstrates that a mrsa patients on the other most of the staff.</seg>
<seg id="33"> That is why the handwashing just, or the wearing of gloves and masks a great importance, however, there are also considerable shortcomings in this area in hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> By mrsa infection contact, or rather in the domestic hospitals, but not always the possibility to isolate the infected patients.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds, just one, although it is ranked between epidemiological point of view, from a distance of at least 1.5 m.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> As karolina further böröcz points out, it is unfortunately less well placed in the financial hospitals even before that used to be saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that actually favour the emergence of infection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Such infections are much less often proven, or the further spread of the infective agent inactive cannot be reversed, where these protection measures are complied with, böröcz karolina.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="39"> Mrsa- infections to get to grips with the health insurance caused enormous costs, it will therefore be combatted everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="40"> In England, for example, the prevention of mrsa, or their containment in the legislative programme.</seg>

<seg id="2"> As Minister for the environment, gábor fodor bekanntgab, the meeting of experts on Tuesday at the end, and the debate on the international climate regime is after 2012 by the ministers on Wednesday the official opening.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts and politicians from discussing 192 countries on the road map of Bali, in which the emission reduzierenden measures for the period after 2012, after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol are established.</seg>
<seg id="4"> There is a heated debate between developed and developing countries in progress.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The USA has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate on specific figures, but would you be prepared to the greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 to reduce 25-40%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The other great issue of the conference is whether the industrial countries are ready, apart from the reduction of emissions in the developing countries, both financially and technologically.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It was also an agreement on support for developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Kyoto Protocol implied adjustment fund should be managed by a 16-köpfigen Council, probably in the Global Environmental Facility (gef) of the UN, as in the piac profit is all és'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Hungary six per cent</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Environment Minister gábor supports fodor on behalf of Hungary the aspiration of the EU, its pioneering role in global climate measures to be retained until 2009, and a new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Minister said that the EU will be the year 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduced by 20% (from 1990 levels), irrespective of whether the 'convention' after 2012 success will be reached, or the Union would not even be willing to use a 30-prozentige reduction, soferne other major industrial countries of the world, or developing countries are also prepared for its commitments and responsibly.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Gábor fodor stressed that the objective of the States that have signed up to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU of the 15 Member States at the time to a reduction of 8% was required.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The target for Hungary is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 6% in comparison to the years 1985-87 - a figure that will meet the country, as the press release is all department of the environment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The stakes are high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate political agreement within a period of two years, otherwise it would be ready to enter into force only after 2012 and, in this case would be laid down in the Kyoto Protocol reduction project, not a new system of international emission consequences, the importance of which the IPCC, the international, with the Nobel Peace Prize climate excellent scientific committee of the UN in its latest report.</seg>
<seg id="15"> That would delay the reduction in emission levels, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 ° C would be inevitable, according to the wissenschaftern extremely serious and irreparable consequences.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Political capital Hungarian guard of increased risk.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the view of the department for risk analysis section) (risk analysing the activities of political capital in this August, with the support of the movement for a better Hungary 'formed Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and of the region in several respects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the report risikowarnungs- 'of the Institute stated amongst other things: in the context of the activities of the Hungarian guard, the highest political risk the tightening up of the existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and nicht-zigeunerbevölkerung in Hungary, even in the short term, lead to violent ethnic conflicts'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian guard, probably at the provocation of such a debate, so that research institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> As has already been mentioned, this will be a failure on the part of the political leaders: considered 'persons of public life, the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groups, who are now left to their political strategy at the Roma ungarn- contrast have built'.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It is believed that this will exacerbate the problem, the sensible dialogue, foot injuries, and the likelihood of violent clashes would increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This means forschungsinsitut ausserdem, the activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, 'the image of Hungary abroad, especially as substantial damage confidence in the stability and democratic maturity.'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Let us remind ourselves that, since the autumn of 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary in the recovery and continuously since summer 2007, 'a number of national defence club founded' organisations have been singled out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> These groups' common characteristic of each define as a civil organisation, while you open to claim that its Members - sometimes armed - defence tasks (for civil protection, national defence, ordnungshütung), in the name of the ineffectiveness of the police, the army, or the State itself ', it said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Furthermore, all of this is in accordance with the method, the attempt to the various different political and party apathy of the population, based on political aspirations to camouflage as civil initiative.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The emphasis on the civilian nature and the association, not just to the circumvention of legal obstacles in the course of the entry on Court which might arise at the same time, it is a political strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> As the analysis is observed, the activities of the Hungarian guard, which is also a risk factor for relations with neighbouring states.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In recent months, the Hungarian guard in several neighbouring States quoted as a potential source of danger, some extreme nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries in the creation of the Hungarian guard against the confirmation of its own policy ungarn-.</seg>
<seg id="14"> All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region, it said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> From the point of view of the research institute is the creation of the Hungarian guard is not an isolated phenomenon in zentral-ost-europa, so the political risk for the entire region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As has already been mentioned, the activities of the Hungarian guard with which the Bulgarian national guard, whose establishment in August 2007 from the extreme right Bulgarian National Union (bnu) has been announced.</seg>
<seg id="17"> In the light of the creation of the Bulgarian guard, the roma-massenausschreitungen in some districts of Sofia (krasna poljana).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The bnu, the incidents at the reason for the establishment of the national guard, taken with the argument that the objective of the organisation of the 'national protection'.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Your opinion, namely in the last 17 years of a 'gypsy terror' in Bulgaria, felt by the state, and has, however, remained indifferent as political resources.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Furthermore, the initiative should have a heated debate in the Bulgarian public losgetreten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As I said, the increased risk for ethnic conflict is also shown by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced their own guards to resistance purposes.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Since the activities of the Hungarian guard has many similarities with which the Bulgarian national guard shows, it is likely that the Hungarian Roma also organise, with their own protection at the threats, at the risk warnungs# report by political capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Attila, juhász director of research in political capital said to question the intelligence agencies: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and should be clear risk changing trends will inform the public opinion, as in the case of the provision of risk warning report.</seg>

<seg id="10"> In addition, there are two holidays, pfingsten at Easter and Christmas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> As our Heads of State, nationhood or religious holidays rarely come to a weekend, the practice of 'arbeitstags- postponement' in the cases where we stood before or after the day would only work for one day.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The price of the extended weekend, however, is that we, on the samstagen to work very well, or in the school must go.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In the next year more holidays in the weekly centre, or at the end of the week, so that the working days will be less umdisponierungen than this year.</seg>
<seg id="18"> First the calendar around the day of the work 'upside down', so that the people of the same four days in a row can stay at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saturday, 26 April will be a working day, so that the Friday, 2 may be a day of rest.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The second umdisponierung is linked to the day, on 23 October, on Saturday, 18 October on the Friday, we will have to deal with 24 October in advance.</seg>

<seg id="7"> At best, it regrets and is trying to repair, perhaps in the marketing department and recognises reumütig possessed, one might have forgotten to host the news (this is the less normal method).</seg>
<seg id="8"> The matter is usually with an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Before being involved in embarrassing excuses, you should consider his colleagues, really tough times can cause and to try to prevent these situations from aware.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Something which is not borrowed a even heard?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> There is very little, nervigeres than opting for a document office software, or does the telephone, but it is not there.</seg>
<seg id="12"> It was a major yesterday is still on the desk - it is way this morning?</seg>
<seg id="13"> Or will the lost pen geglaubte around on the desk discovered a colleague?</seg>
<seg id="14"> It is not without questions from Members, because they are angry, and rightly, if you find that something is weggekommen.</seg>
<seg id="15"> So, no kuverts or post-its from the office in the pocket, because it could set a themselves, because if we refuse 's desperately needs.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If the office is possessed by nagging headaches ill, because we feel very uneasy, or merely to rest, we should be clear about one thing: the work urgent settlement, projects with firm dates must now rather than a matter of the Members.</seg>
<seg id="25"> The Members due not evil.</seg>
<seg id="26"> When you have the previous day, we know that the next day in the Bureau will not create, or that something could dazwischenkommen, and therefore we must remain at home, we should declare it in good time, so that neither the gentlemen, yet the head unexpectedly with the absence.</seg>

<seg id="30"> We should not be singing with sums, talks (the people on their heads, getrampel leads), dauerndem ski struggles or stop complaining about such issues nerves.</seg>

<seg id="1"> By budget</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, it is.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The public budget is adopted.</seg>
<seg id="4"> What is particularly on this budget?</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is the first budget that this government has drafted, and without the support of opposition by the coalition majority was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The for the current year, with the support of the cssd (social democrats), because it sobotka (of this party Minister), and the cssd therefore could not afford to reject it.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government nothing drastic happened this time.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The Congress of Deputies approved this traditional little attended, nevertheless very important act calmly.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This is somewhat paradoxical.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Everything governance begins and ends with the various chapters of the budget and, whether we like it or not.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The budget is an integral part of the policy, but by means of full power struggle of the government and the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="12"> This is a dankbareres subject for the media, and that is why they devote more attention.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A dispute among politicians is much more interesting for the public as a sober figures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The public budgets have suffered in the last social democratic governments under three weaknesses, the budget for the year 2008 can eliminate not at once.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The first is the high percentage of expenditure, which is binding in law, because it is not only the pensions, but also social expenditure, the 'tacit' coalition of cssd and kscm (Communists) in the last year before the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The second is the deficit of budgetary policy as a result of the first weak point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The third restriction is the deficits of the public finances, in other words the budgetary deficits of the Communities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The main risk is, however, not the state budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id="19"> This budget is public and eingermaßen under control.</seg>
<seg id="20"> A veritable time bomb is the budgetary deficit of the Communities.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Many mayors, gave no revenue from tax, levies and other sources for investment bank loans, often for consideration by the bonds of their halls in the excessive indebted.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In recent years, this debt managed by massive selling shares and other supplies of energy networks in the train of privatisation of the State, a result had received.</seg>
<seg id="23"> This source is now already be extinguished.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> As far as we are only of official and verifiable facts, we find that:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Our economy has, for a number of years, as the rest of the world, which is currently going through a period of growth, the cssd boasts about constantly.</seg>
<seg id="26"> This was a unique opportunity for their governments, public finances in order.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Instead, the governments of the state debt, however, still more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Pakistan, Albania or Egypt, have spent much more sensible than our Republic.</seg>
<seg id="29"> That is a great shame, mainly the previous governments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> We are among the countries that, on a global scale, seen the threat of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="31"> That is why no nassiven social programmes, which are, unfortunately, just in the last few years in überflüssigerweise aufgeblasen huge scale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Even if it is a part of the senseless populist expenditure, which this year before the elections have been adopted, it is clear that if it is not in the near future, to an increase in the retirement age and a pension reform, practically ends in any policy in this country, and, regardless of who is in power, he will not remain a purely manage.</seg>
<seg id="33"> It is only too easy to say that current politicians from the officers, the bulk of the tax revenue mechanical on pensions and social expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="34"> Therefore, this year's budget no revolution, but can only be normal expenditure by the displacement of compulsory expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="35"> In 2008, the deficit of 70 billion kronor would be entirely superfluous if previous governments in the last ten years, which not only have been spent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If we do not want that it really is that ruling politicians purely administrative officials, we must be patient and that is not too strong coalition government which, however, is aware that the state cannot spend just as much as it to take on taxes and charges of calm in the preparation for further reform laws.</seg>
<seg id="37"> This can only be a gradual implementation of a balanced budget.</seg>

<seg id="2"> The found by the drivers, which is one of the possible claim, which implies a high cost, the level of wiederrum depends on various factors, including their age, sex, the drafting of the driving licence, family, type of cars insured and use, and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> To have a car is only the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="4"> It is even more difficult to find the right to be found as the right vehicle model.</seg>
<seg id="5"> First of all, a clear, what we are dealing with.</seg>
<seg id="6"> A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This agreement is written by an insurance Treaty, which lays down that the society and the abgesprochene insurance premium is obliged in return for a disaster to submit the appropriate compensation sum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The insurance premium is the cost of insurance, which is made up of a number of factors, including the age, sex, time of the preparation of the driving licence, family, type of vehicle insured or use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The insurance companies are the statistics in accordance with their prices, and so to a higher risk of accidents due higher contributions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> For this reason, both on 25-jährige and women less contributions, for statistics show that these groups thanks to your prudence in a lower level of accidents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The same goes for married people, since this according to the statistical values and therefore also the conviction, to fewer accidents as a tendency to go it alone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The benefits which will affect the vehicle, the frequency of the fahrens and therefore the probability of an accident.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The more often the use of the damage, the more likely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> In the preparation of the insurance premium must take account of a number of points.</seg>
<seg id="15"> For this reason, we must carefully study the situation of drivers, precisely in order to select the car insurance, the most personal needs.</seg>
<seg id="16"> At this point we lists are the most important points which we in the selection of a security should take into account, not just a service, but also a price on election.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Under 25 year-old meeting on the choice of cheap insurance to many obstacles, such as, for example, the low level of driving and  young  licence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Even if it is an ideal insurance protection would be the best way to conclude a vollkaskoversicherung, there are cheaper alternatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The cautious drivers can choose to vollkasko of participation, so that the benefits of a vollkaskoversicherung is covered, but at a low price.</seg>
<seg id="20"> This type of treaty means that the customer is a part of the damage caused by the amount must pay for themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The  amount will be a conclusion of the Treaty and the level of insurance premium and this is set to bezahlende higher, the smaller the amount,  Luis Noguera, Spain, the main representative at first Europe, a conciliation for online insurance companies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Another option is the enlarged security, the customers insured against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused to the own car.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Furthermore, this type of insurance theft, fire and vehicle loss.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> There is a Council.</seg>
<seg id="25"> If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hands, to reduce the costs of insurance; this is your credit by versuchst careful to avoid driving and accidents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> A credit is a reduction of the basic tariff in the relevant insurance company.</seg>
<seg id="27"> On the contrary, a criminal payment raising tariff in question.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The level  credits and criminal payments conditional on the society and their income.</seg>
<seg id="29"> If the company a yield year behind it, it can allow itself to increase the payments bonus- Noguera,  explained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> As soon as the 25-jahre-marke is exceeded, for the sake of the drivers, it is easy to conclude an agreement, and the reason for this is the fact that as a result of the accident rate driving.</seg>
<seg id="31"> It is therefore best to campaign for a vollkaskoversicherung with voluntary participation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">  can normally do not benefit from the young people of their previous experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of the fahrens , not the Spanish vorsteher of the European company, and adds that the majority of the accidents in the second place, operational year after the  fear of the anfängers himself .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> It is nevertheless a married customers, no children, that is, of course, to conclude a vollkaskoversicherung; only if the financial situation of the appropriate person also allows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> From the insurers are married couples with children as customers, with the lowest rate of accidents, and correspondingly low also fall within their contributions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> In this case, with a vollkaskoversicherung (for a sum of about EUR 300) the best option in the event that it has received a great credit, is an enlarged Security, only the third year of vehicle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> You are  as a whole and entspannter have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to pay a higher contributions, Luis Noguera,  schedule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> It provides for pensioners, with a vollkaskoversicherung (for a sum of about EUR 150), or an enlarged security, the only conclude with a sufficiently high credit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Finally, it must be said that the car insurance is something very important, not only because they are the driver protects against possible accident damage, but also because of the high costs that it will require a thorough choice is made, in line with our own situation.</seg>

<seg id="4"> None of the questions on Wednesday evening, 28 November, were raised as ridiculous as the white man, Democrats on the global warming in the debate youtube speak of the other party.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But the issues, and the answers, this time spiegelten exactly the state of the republican party in the elections next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It is not known as the producers of CNN, the debate, mitunterstützten the potential candidates youtube zeigenden clips auswählten.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, in the first half hour of debate, the longest the individual issue has been devoted to the issue of immigration in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The issue is one of the most potent issues for Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The CNN asked a group of hybrid electorate a flat wähl# to operate, if you have heard that they liked things: the television station said intensity of the agreement as the candidates strictly on the borders of languages.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The strictest and longest exchange between rudy Giuliani was the evening, the national leaders, and romney in the crucial polls in iowa and new Hampshire forward was.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The image of companies' shackles tried Giuliani, he is flexible with regard to illegal immigration, when he was mayor of New York.</seg>
<seg id="12"> It romney attacked the former governor of Massachusetts accused of a crime, illegal immigrants for work on his house to cease.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The two, particularly formidable apart as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates' Amnesty '(the illegal a regular status and the opportunity to the citizenship) would support would be.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Relatively unimportant candidates as Duncan hunter, a kalifornischer members of Congress and Tom tancredo congressmen, a Member of Parliament from Colorado, has been able to press on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Neither of the two men has serious opportunities in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they earlier and more than other on the immigration pauke gehauen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At least in the area of immigration in the candidate countries share the same views: tougher limits, intolerance towards illegal migrants.</seg>
<seg id="17"> This issue, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, the republicans help the differences between liberal and Christian Conservative to forget or to emigrate.</seg>
<seg id="18"> However, the debate has been clearly problematic than other issues were raised.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Mr Giuliani was asked why he arms restrictions have supported in the past.</seg>
<seg id="20"> John MacKein and romney debating whether simuliertes drowning should be regarded as torture.</seg>
<seg id="21"> One of the questioner asked whether the candidates every word of the Bible.</seg>
<seg id="22"> This meant that the Giuliani arguing that although the Bible privileged paper, it should be the history of jonah and perhaps not quite literally, think of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Now huckabee Mike - contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.</seg>
<seg id="25"> As he has been pressed, whether they are in favour of Jesus, he said lachte and intelligent Jesus was in order to apply a political office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The race is exceptionally wide open.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Huckabees rise in iowa, together with Ron pauls recent spendener# consequences and his beifalls# storms in the debate by Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="28"> These two are hochgeschossen from nothing, because the two wing of the Party not to one of the better known and more traditional candidates.</seg>
<seg id="29"> In the year 2000, and a candidate from the outset, the party and convincingly, together with winning a message on the size of the USA and a zwinkern on both arms of the party.</seg>
<seg id="30"> This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Pain of the Labour Party</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Gordon Brown has another hole someone discovered to fall; his way out of this will remain the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> For British scandals, this is not particularly schlüpfrig.</seg>
<seg id="4"> No adels# title seem, sold any politician Paris hotel bills, paid no zehen gelutscht wedlock.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But the discovery that a rich businessman donations for the British Labour Government, on more than 650.000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) on four years under the name of other people, and to conceal the party that has failed to declare the disputed territory is something without Gordon Brown, would be well managed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Two months ago, as the Prime Minister of the demand for an election, away from dämliche way on the intelligence of the British offensive by he claimed that opinion polls, this decision would have been influenced, there was hope that it will provide a strong, efficient government.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Instead, as vince cable, the increasingly incisive representative chairman of the Liberal Democrats, said, the dreaded brown formerly by Stalin to Mr bean.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The unwise, saving Northern Bank, a fragile regulatory weakness and poor judgement under fire.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Ill thought-out proposals to amend the tax laws against the government business associations.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The tax system of loss of the personal data of 25 million people showed incredible administrative to pick.</seg>
<seg id="11"> A trio of generals in the retirement, an uprising in the House of Lords in protest at cuts of military expenditure, the Ministers of the armed forces, it is claimed that a teilzeitjob.</seg>
<seg id="12"> There is now the wide range of donations of David Abraham; Mr Watts, Labour's Secretary-General (and your former head) compliance is already resigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> None of this means that brown waived irrevocable direction.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Governments can, however, be a turning point that you feel it impossible to govern.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Neither politicians may still have confidence people, but they are usually their scepticism, if a new force takes the office.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister to improve the situation, and it does not even to be too long is this postponement: over the public service will begin to leak; the cabinet ministers to start plaudern; the press is looking for bad news, and the government is too defensive and no ambition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In a way, the position of brown is particularly difficult, because in contrast to other political leaders cannot say that a new besen.</seg>
<seg id="18"> He is so keen to Tony Blair would be denied, he was upper lieutenant.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The problems with northern rock and the tax documents of competence, for example, hang together with decisions of the brown, as Chancellor of the Finance Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And even if this was not directly involved in Blair's mishaps, as in the case of long 'money for adels# title' -untersuchung of political party funding may be - the electorate that he was.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Nevertheless, brown 'situation is not as bad as it seems</seg>
<seg id="22"> The failings are not so terrible, as you describe the Conservatives.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Like Mr bean, no one is entirely beschwindelt or has died.</seg>
<seg id="24"> And the antidote, painful as it may be, is, of course, seeking brown Stalinist tendencies are promised: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The new political gesture donation is a good example.</seg>
<seg id="26"> The garboeske Abraham, of its donations compared with its non-profit-making gave, he says, do not want any public recognition for its goodwill.</seg>
<seg id="27"> That may be so, but the decision was not to him.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The laws against anonymity for great political contributors are clear and they are from a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is able to buy access to those who govern the country.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Watts, who says he would know from Abraham agreement, but that it is illegal, will naturally need to ask some questions; just as jon, mendlesohn Labour's hauptfinanzeintreiber, about the bizarre donations in October have been told.</seg>
<seg id="30"> But so far not involved is brown: there is nothing that evidence that he knew of this confusion, although most of the payments for his appointment in June.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> To date, the Prime Minister, half of the job.</seg>
<seg id="32"> He has quickly the violation of the law by his party, but he condemned watered-down this determination by seizing a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on this issue -, to complete the picture of a bishop of the retirement and a judge.</seg>
<seg id="33"> In this case, the 'lessons' is not very complicated.</seg>
<seg id="34"> If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Apart from that, there are other things to which Mr Brown, as something of a permanent chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life, of the last six months is unfilled, and move forward with a drastic reform of political party funding.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> It would require the hard-liners of labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and the special financial relationship with the unions bitter pills, for a party members, such as Mr Brown.</seg>
<seg id="37"> But it should be aware of some partisan facts.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The Conservatives have a clear lead in the opinion polls in two years; he has voters; and the only way in which he has achieved is a victory by indisputable probity and solid competence.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The United Kingdom, in the face of decision on the statements by owais Shah and ravi bopara</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Each of these two dilemmas, almost as difficult as the others.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Who is supposed to be no 6 for England in kandy this weekend, propose owais Shah or ravi bopara?</seg>
<seg id="4"> And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second question is important because David graveney, chairman of the elections on call, at least in this particular title, this is the chief coach Peter Michael Vaughan - showing the captain and moores to help and to decide on the table, because of the high morries, the English executive director, beginning with applications for national electoral offices, or even to fill in part-time work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Whoever gets the sixth thugs position, will be particularly unfortunate, but life is often unfair and it is undoubtedly the sport.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It is never easy to apply a person, what exactly is the tip of his professional activity, whereas someone else to achieve never on the lowest status, hinauskommt sometimes luck instead of a lack of capacity.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is not only in the cricket, where the choice is difficult, where decisions are needed, which are at the end of subjective.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It is the right time for bopara levels?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Is it fair to Shah if he is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="11"> The same may also be asked in a further area if, for example, John edwards tubby 'or', banerjee both intelligent young executives with good qualifications, which are well acquainted with the business, should be promoted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Who can say what the right class for a cricketers, unless he will have the opportunity to go to or swim.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Of course, pay a great influence on decisions, but we also have opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Within a team, a cricketers, the eye of the captain at the right time to start a wicket can and must take a bat regular opportunities on the regulation, when he, as a eintägiger cricketers impression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The eyes of the auswähler to catch is more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="16"> There were a lot in the last season, better than, for example, as James Anderson, were to play in the first test, even if Stephen harmison itself for healthy and declared as the wind in the networks kegelt.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Anderson, 32 first-class wickets with the 33, runs a position in this tour.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr tremlett only 29, with the same modest average, but they had their own high points and hope for even more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Whether or bopara Shah plays in the asgiriya stage, can only be a way of looking at issue.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The election could decide the careers of both men, or perhaps it makes little difference.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Four years ago in Sri Lanka played batty Gareth in each test and has been successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, it was, in fact, Paul collingwood at the time to consolidate kämpfend, of the breakthrough on an important test cricketers, even though he has used and of a double hundred against Australia in Australia, punktete perhaps still being underestimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> It is probable that, graveney Vaughan - showing and moores, after a further discussion in the context of the current network meeting at the stage asgiriya its Conservative instincts and heavy feeling for shahs greater experience on young people boparas enthusiasm will follow.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> There are arguments for both.</seg>
<seg id="24"> For its funkelnden Shah speaks and valuable 88 test-debüt-innings in Mumbai, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of bopara, with 22 years of age, and seven years is an excellent record against angedrehtes bullets.</seg>
<seg id="25"> But only ten runs Shah made in his two innings in the West Indies against may on the test in Lord, its own arena as a player from middlesex, and this, plus the immediate rejection of the auswählern Vaughan - showing healthy, as was his position for the next game, seems to withdraw from the impetus to its proposal, which was obviously in Mumbai.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In contrast, the alleskönner Essex schaufel# way of life.</seg>
<seg id="27"> It is of no place in a British impressed by his attitude and out of this has to come to the point, as he recently with a vehicle in vierradantrieb an exhibition of England sponsor Volkswagen succession.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> He has suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was, of course, also be gesponsort) (Vodafone and his team was Mr Alastair Cook of justice, of this from afar, observed with enthusiasm and say: "Have you taken? '.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Bopara is a much better field, it will be kegelt central rate here with some effect on the playing fields, as he seems to fit and proposes with confidence and skill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The right man is one thing, to choose the right moment to choose a different.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Perhaps that is the real art of choice.</seg>
<seg id="32"> I tend now bopara its chance, which does not mean that Shah not perhaps be doing well, if, as the teesatz from Ceylon suggests that it was he who will play in this weekend.</seg>
