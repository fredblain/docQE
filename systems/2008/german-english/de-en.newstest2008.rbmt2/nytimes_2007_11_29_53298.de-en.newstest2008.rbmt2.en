British Bänker declare themselves guilty in the case Enron 
Three British bankers who should be confronted for their role in the deceitful system with the former main finance leader of Enron, Andrew Fastow, with court changed their petitions into guilty on Wednesday. 
Originally David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had pleaded open innocently in the year 2000 to make at the expense of its employer money for the alleged Konspirieren in seven cases of deceit below use of tele-means of communication with Fastow in a secret finance deceit. 
The method had been set for January. 
But during a hearing in front of court in front of U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein junior everybody pleaded for a case of deceit guiltily below use of tele-means of communication. 
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unity of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, were confessed in Great Britain within delivery methods which lasted for two years. 
Their case is a loose end of an examination which was started to Enrons collapse in 2001 in the United States. 
The accusations submitted against it originally in the year 2002 drew Fastow attention to the fact that it was the aim of an examination of the government in connection with the Enron decline. 
Conspiracy cooks up a former top adviser Michael Kopper the charges against the bankers around a deceitful one with Fastow and his -- been called the "NatWest three", they are come in the year 2000 to Houston, claimed. 
Greenwich Natwest had invested to a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron which was checked by Fastow which was the architect of innumerable deceitful Enron wheelings and dealings which have contributed to tear the company in the bankruptcy whirlpool. 
The bank had the value at the beginning of 2002 its participation in the subsidiary on zero appreciated but the three British men knew that it had in reality considerable value. 
An enterprise under Koppers control purchased the shares of the bank in the subsidiary for 1 million dollar. 
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars for a participation in this enterprise. 
According to the charges Fastow represented wrongly, that opposite Enron the energy enterprise would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary. 
The 20 million dollars but actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others. 
Did 7.3 million dollars get the bankers during Fastow, Kopper, and cashed in other about 12.3 million dollars according to the charges. 
Fastow declared itself for its role in two counts of an indictment on conspiracy in the Enrons flop guiltily in January 2004. 
The British trio was arrested three months later. 
Fastow serves a 6-year prison sentence in federal prison of Louisiana. 
Kopper serves a sentence of three years and a month in facilities in Texarkana. 
Each of the three men was on free foot due to a 1 million dollar bail which required it that they lived in expectation of the legal proceedings in the United States. 
Enron, once the siebtgrößte enterprise of the nation crumbled in the bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of book-keeping tricks could cover the billion debts up or make weak businesses seem profitable no more. 
The collapse destroyed thousands from jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars Pensionspläne. 
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and the former chairman of the executive board Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse. 
Skilling serves a sentence of more than 24 years. 
Lay's condemnations for conspiracy, deceit and other counts of an indictment got trivial after it died because of heart disease last year.
