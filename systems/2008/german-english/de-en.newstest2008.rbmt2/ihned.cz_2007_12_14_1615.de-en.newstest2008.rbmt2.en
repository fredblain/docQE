A Nicaraguan court confirms a twenty-year prison sentence for Expräsidenten 
On Thursday, a court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year prison sentence for the former president to Arnold Alemán to whom he had been condemned because of finance deceit in the amount of 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns) in 2003. 
Later he had been discharged from prison and lived under detention on his Hazienda at the nicaruanischen metropolis, however. 
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes behind bars again is currently unclear to AP according to the news agency. 
Whether one lets Alemán serve its sentence at home or whether it must to prison will depend on the custody officials according to the chairwoman of the court of appeal, Ileana Pérez, now. 
Four years ago, a court proved, that Alemán had regularly moved money of the government on accounts of foreign companies in Panama. 
These companies were fictitious and in reality the accounts belonged to his relatives and narrowest supporters. 
Some of this money finally landed in a fund which Alemán had established for the financing of its election campaign 2001.
