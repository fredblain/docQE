Card sharks 
Does the credit crisis infect America's credit card market? 
If blood is in the water, it is is only natural that dorsal fins irritated around whirls. 
Now where America's property market is ailing, the beasts of prey have the credit card market of the country in the visor. 
Analysts of Goldman Sachs expect that the credit card losses could reach 99 billion dollars if the risk of infection of underfunded loans spreads on other forms of consumption loans. 
Symptoms of the strain are considerably visible. 
There are increases both at the end bookings and at the default rates which measure the share of the loans which respectively aren't retractable or more when 30 days too late. 
The HSBC has because of the weak side of credit card recipients partly announced last month that it has taken a 1.4 billion dollars charges elevation from its American consumer financings. 
It is nevertheless too early to sink into panic. 
Losses and defaults are still low. 
A full percentage point below the historical average was almost the third party quarter SÃ¤umnissrate of 3.89% according to the Ratingagentur Moody. 
The deterioration at the rates can partly be explained by technical factors. 
A change in the American led private insolvency on the right laws to an abrupt case of bankruptcy registrations which in turn agree on a large portion of the Keditkartenverluste for one into 2005; registrations (and with that default fines) would this one rise again whether the number the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not. 
The industry also reports of solid payment rates which show how much the consumers pay every month off of their debts 
and the confidence in credit card based securities is rather strong despite the interruption in other corners of the structured financing. 
Dennis Moroney of the control tower Group, a research enterprise, expects that the amounts of version for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year in the end. 
There surely are direct infection channels between the property credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more probable that consumers raise credit card debts, now that own home loans dry out. 
The card exhibitors look but therefore dropping house prices don't redeem a bill of exchange necessarily in the credit rating of the borrower on the money river instead of on capital values. 
You even can be for the card exhibitors of advantage. 
The incentives for consumers furthermore to pay the mortgage rates diminish if the real estate is worth some as the value of the loan; as a result the card debts get more important under the repayment priorities. 
Card exhibitors also can much faster and more flexibly react as a lender to the stormier conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits. 
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a fast reassessment of the assets. 
"We won't wake up one day and the loans completely newly judge", says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones main finance speaker. 
Even if a sudden cover shortage crisis is improbable in the credit card market, the risks of a lasting downturn are substantially more real. 
If lower house prices and a credit reduction press America in the recession, the industry will stand undoubtedly before a more furious future. 
They hold the far lookout for these shark fins.
