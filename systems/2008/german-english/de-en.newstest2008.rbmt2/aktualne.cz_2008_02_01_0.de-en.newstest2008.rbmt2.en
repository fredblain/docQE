A deceitful broker risked billions because of feelings of inferiority 
Bottomless swindler 
So Jerome Kerviel describes his former employee the French bank giant Société Générale owner the local Komercní banka. 
She came namely because of him around almost five billion euros. 
However, it seems sooner that way, furthermore it for certain wasn't incompetent that Kerviel was only a big player which wanted to do it to its colleagues at once. 
To the difference compared with all big bank houses he recognized the crisis by the amerikanischenn mortgage market on time. 
It "is" emotionally rather weak, could be heard from the mouth of its supervisors who reported it to the police. 
How these result, from the statements Kerviels Le moons, however, the French media, for example the daily published, he was a man who had made profits in the amount of 1.6 billion euros with his business at the end of last year. 
Crisis not only in America 
"Everything I wanted had to be earned for my bank money", he claims in his statement. 
He had managed to earn half a billion euro just at the American crisis in summer. 
He had already espied the opportunity of it namely at the beginning of the year. 
In February there already was first news about it that which already used, or such as it, installment problems had, are given, would be guessed into difficulties so-called Sub-Prime mortgages low-income customer. 
However, influence on the whole economy shouldn't have this crisis. 
Kerviel didn't believe this and was still right. 
He had very screwed his profit except for 1.6 billion euros at the end of the year. 
Already when I had earned the first half billion I "didn't" know how I should declare this Kerviel admits and passes on, that it has kept nothing definitely for itself. 
During the whole interrogation he admits that he has falsified documents so that he would the on not come one would creep. 
He even succeeded in leading his bosses behind the light even if the Eurex stock exchange was gradually interested in his business. 
Risk profit 
Feared he to be exposed? 
Welfare hardly. 
"I thought that she satisfies the simple fact that I have earned 1.6 billion for the bank." 
Where did he take the courage to risk so much from? 
He had to work out his position gradually. 
In the year 2000, immediate, he entered the Société Générale after it had completed its studies at the University of Lyon. 
His annual salary amounted to about 51000 dollars. 
After two years he was already an assistant of a broker and in the year 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars. 
He nevertheless knew that he will never earn much just like other. 
"Already during my first conversation in the year 2005 I knew that one watched me. 
Kerviel explained the examination official because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development, ". 
But according to its admission already soon the first great success came. 
With the shares of the alliance he earned much by setting euros half a billion at the London bomb attacks on losses on exchange of this title. 
And this was the trigger -- he wanted more now. 
As long as you make profit, we let you 
"This is like a snowball", he told the policemen. 
But the bosses knew about everything allegedly or suspected it. 
"As long as I earned money, one closed the eyes." 
But then the great blow came at the beginning of this year. 
On one single day he lost a billion euro. 
He wanted to compensate for it at a weekend middle of January. 
When he came to work on Monday he was already no more employee of the bank. 
And the bank announced a couple of days later that it has because of him lost five billion euros. 
On and how they came for him the crept? 
He made himself suspicious through a vacation. 
"I have taken only four days of the previous year. 
One which doesn't want that one looks it into the cards is " a broker who doesn't take any vacation Kerviel said in conclusion.
