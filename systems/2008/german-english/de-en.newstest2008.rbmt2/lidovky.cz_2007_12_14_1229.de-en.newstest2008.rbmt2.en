Global climate changes harm allegedly developing countries most. 
President VÃ¡clav Klaus spoke again about the difficulties of the global warming. 
The criticism was referring to the international meeting of UNO coming to an end for the climate change in Bali now. 
He executed, that in Vienna where he presented his book "a blue, no green planet" the debates of the ecologists are incredible. 
Not only the structure of the meeting which of government delegates and such forms a strange mixture of not government organizations is unacceptable according to Klaus but difference between the rhetoric which accompanies it and the reality also the basic. 
The debate there is unstructured, this it is a word firework " only a substitute is, for an actual solution of present problems " Klaus said. 
The Czech president emphasized at the presentation of his book that the topic is very important for him and that therefore he commits himself to it so. 
His satisfaction expressed also about this that his book is published in German translation because "I often meet" caricatures of my views him. 
So interested parties could look up his attitude undistortedly now. 
Klaus reminded that he no-one is climatic box but he has sufficient prerequisites in his opinion to write such a book. 
He is finally a graduate to understand and to judge technical treatises capably, has experience with statistics and is also an economist. 
He described the thesis as main statement of the book, that the climate permanently changes and that so its changes are normal that the effort is superfluously ineffectively and unacceptably influence the development of the climate, and that effortful no corresponding opinion admits for the global warming under the scientists that the results of the present changes are great and serious and therefore didn't represent no threat too. 
Furthermore he regards to force unproved opinions upon others for unacceptable as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen he considers this a dangerous restriction of the liberty. 
On questions of persons present he explained repeated, he is not up against ", but against militant environmental activists, a sensible environmental protection which doesn't consider the relationship between effort and yield ". 
Klaus had already talked about the same topic in Vienna in the Hayek institute two months ago.
