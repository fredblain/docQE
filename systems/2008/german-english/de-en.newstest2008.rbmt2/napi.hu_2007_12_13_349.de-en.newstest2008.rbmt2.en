Auchan at the most expensive one, Tesco increased around almost a fifth 
The Hypermarkets in the Budaörser trade area also have this year keeps the average price increase of 16% of the last year with the difference that no rise of the value added tax gave it this year. 
Article from Napi Gazdaság 
In the Budaörser trade triangle the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" of also this year by 16 per cent has increased, price increases were registered by over 1,000 hooves into all Hypermärkten, though. 
After the prices have "galloped from it" in the food markets in last December, the price increase prozentuell hasn't turned out drastic, compared with the anyway high, earlier baseline. 
It seems certainly deterrent to the consumers, though, that hoof isn't even this year for what they had paid hoof last year still far under 9,000 available for 10,000. 
The price of the "Napi" shopping basket exceeded the magical 10,000 hoof limit hoof in the examined markets by at least 91. 
The highest price amounted hoof to 10,573. 
The price at 6,800 was (hoof) in 6800. 
The prices remained almost on last year's level for Unicum and live fish, the prices for turkey breast pieces of tenderloin, nut and poppy, have increased strongly, however. 
Prices for flour and bread corresponded, the head offices of statistical office of Hungary to the data there was 1 kg of bread morning call for 139 Forint at Auchan, however. 
There wasn't any competition conditional sudden fall in price at the product on under 200 Forint. 
The price of a two liters Coca-Cola returnable bottle of under 200 Forint was here, also surprising the drink therefore cost inclusive pledge only 257 hoof. 
This year in the "Napi" shopping basket comparison Auchan at the most expensive one and Cora at the most favorable one nevertheless came off. 
Our calculations have arisen that have Cora, increased by 18 per cent during Tesco and Auchan respectively the prices in the "Napi" shopping basket opposite the Christmas prices last year at 15. 
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the this year's year was 12% the rise between the cheapest shopping basket of the last year, lasting and expensive the current year 21% turned off. 
The average rise in prices was 1,480.00 hoof. 
The average price increase was at 1,206.00 Forint in the previous year still, the added value tax increase manifested itself at the prices at last Christmas, though. 
Exactly this process has affected the trade terribly: The department stores apparently couldn't decide so properly which price margin they shall use at the individual articles since the effects of the price increase on the consumerism were unforeseeable. 
(If the dealer plans the circulation speed of a product badly, he can fall around essential profits in the price margin which goes by the traffic intensity.) 
The price increase of the "Napi" shopping basket turned out Mehwertsteuer conditional so radically last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint whereas the price difference was merely 844 Forint at the cheapest basket. 
Such extremes weren't watched since the most expensive basket cost around 1,630.00 Forint more than in the previous year and this year there was a rise in prices of 1,284.00 Forint even at the cheapest one. 
Showed itself a disastrous price increase in the comparison of the two last Christmas seasons, the price of the daily consumption articles into the Hypermärkten has increased into less than 20 months around more as 30 per cent. 
(In turn this doesn't confirm this one the head offices of statistical office of Hungary absolutely to data: The statistical office stated one more than a 30 per cent price increase at some basic foodstuffs in the period of 12 months. 
Next to flour also at eggs so approximately). 
If one takes, however, a look into the "Napi" shopping basket, this almost seems at the latter by no means, there the price level the has risen even in the worst case around hardly more than 10 per cent already in the previous year of expensive product. 
Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten -- after all, they could pass the drastic price increase on to the multinationals. 
The Hypermärkte don't complain in the golden trade triangle; It is reported constantly of good years. 
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers doesn't look on the prices in the three department stores any more. 
Large quantities are bought from everything, durable food goes in pallets over the shop counters. 
There were endless snakes in all three department stores at the Kassa Wednesday morning when the number of the customers suddenly exploded. 
Is of, though, a lower customer frequency reports to the country so that many multinationals complain to the pollsters they couldn't reach once the planned sales volume and to be more precise not only at food but also at lasting consumer goods.
