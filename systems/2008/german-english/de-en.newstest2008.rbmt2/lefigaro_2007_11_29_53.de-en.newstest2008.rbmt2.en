Spectacular repair at the space station 
Having needed in the space more than seven hours to become an astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades of the crew of the international space station (eat) to carry out the spectacular repair of a faulty solar panel which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific work on the station. 
A daring exit, this one due to its duration, the distance of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the one of the astronauts?made things with one's hands? Tools have obtained several records to carry out the repair. 
The problem which shall take the European and Japanese scientific Labore soon appeared on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the space shuttle Discovery, one great zylinderförmiges part. 
This module is a kind of jetty for the module Labore. 
But one must be able to supply her with current. 
So it was already on this one the second task of the crew this eat himself was, convert to take it to its definite position, a 17.5 tons heavy module to the electricity generation about solar panels. 
After it had moved it, the crew made itself to the restructuring of the solar panels of the module whose span width is 76 meters. 
One of the collectors and it happened that like Akkordeone, the himself lets on-folds, meter was damaged by a jammed cable on a length of approximately one 
The restructuring was stopped to not damage the collector still more. 
The astronauts who should originally leave the space shuttle Discovery for an inspection round and then repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty felt forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector. 
And it became Scott Parazynski to stroll around at the end of the 30 meters long remotely controlled arm of the space shuttle which had been attached to that one of the station to carry out the repair, selected. 
Is?it one of the best Spacewalker? (Wetraumgänger) NASA. 
He has greatly, robustly a well developed upper part of the body and long arms, sent very much. 
So was, ? the 46 - jähirige's trained doctor selected this one hurt? Solar panel to?operate? 
Durchtrennte after it had examined the damages exactly and a type made up tracks on the damaged place him the faulty cable. 
It was of a second??, this one Spacewalker had left nearby the sluice, supported, and, of inside, of the other astronauts under them Peggy Whitson commanding officer of the crew. 
The tool which he used, a mini-hockey stick, to prevent an electric blow on the solar panels which produce several hundred volts, the astronauts on board of the station thought up had and?made things with one's hands, wound insulator? 
When the action was ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was on folded completely before it counted out its tools and swept back to the station. 
The astronauts enjoyed diversion half a day yesterday afternoon before, today, seven astronauts swept back on the space shuttle Discovery to most likely begin the return flight to the earth on Wednesday.
