Department attack 
A hard exchange of blows -- and must be afraid of an outsider candidate now in the Youtube debate of the republican candidates for the presidency deliver the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney to themselves. 
The strain of the candidates already unloads itself for the first topic. 
It has made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney reproaches its opponents for Rudy Giuliani. 
This counters for his part with difficult reproaches: This "I would say its own house was a port for illegal", Giuliani replies and throws former governor of Massachusetts in front of, to have privately employed immigrants without papers. 
The candidates blow for the attack: Because furthermore the republican base doesn't have any clear favorite, the eight presidency candidates use the debate on CNNs primarily to discredit their adversaries. 
30 second videos, the Internet users this one have roll-ups sent in via Youtube, are hardly more than keyword giver. 
John McCain reproaches his opponent Ron Paul who demands an immediate discount as the only one in the round from Iraq "we have let Hitler come to the power" with this kind of isolationism. 
Also Romney gets strongly the read of the Vietnam veteran, as it an interrogation method refuses, the so-called "Waterboarding", drown which you feign but to condemn torture. 
The reactions of the hall audience show Petersburg in piece in Floridas that the important topics of the campaign lie, however, on the other side of Iraq war and torture debates meanwhile. 
When conservative values are always praised and future tax increases declined approval surges in the lecture-hall. 
More lets himself be seen once where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie. 
"I have been mistaken at that time", it Romney explains remorsefully and makes in front of base and viewers its apology for this that was still proper in 1994 to the abortion supporters. 
Giuliani, however, starts lurching from side to side, you ask for its opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible as it.
