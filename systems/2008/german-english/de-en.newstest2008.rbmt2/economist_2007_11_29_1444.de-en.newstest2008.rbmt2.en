Everything still open 
Mitt Romey said it doesn't regard one as candidates for the presidency worthily to be, questioned by a snowman. 
The republican candidate nevertheless declared himself the presidency in the end ready to face a debate on YouTube in which normal voters on video take and submit questions to send it to the candidate. 
Nones of the questions which were raised on the Wednesday evening, November 28th, were as ridiculous as the snowman which questioned democrats about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party. 
But the questions and the answers reflected exactly the condition of the republican party this time which bursts in the elections next year. 
It isn't known, exact like the producers of CNNs which selected the debate YouTube supported co-to be shown these to the prospective candidates clips. 
This one was dedicated to a single topic, Immigration was in the center however in the first half hour of the debate, the longest. 
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for republicans. 
The CNNs asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial if they heard things which they liked: The television organization noticed tops of the consent as the candidates strictly spoke about the limits. 
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was in Iowa between Rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner and Romney, the surveys making up their mind in this one, and has shoved New Hampshire forwards. 
Giuliani tries to shake the reputation off, it has been soft with regard to illegal Immigration when it was a mayor of New York. 
He attacked Romney to have it hired the former governor immigrants who are accused by Massachusetts and illegal in this for work on its house. 
The two sat down particularly intensely from each other as questioners wondered whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegal a regular status and the possibility on the citizenship). 
More insignificant candidates like Duncan Hunter, a Californian convention representative, and Tom Tancredo, a convention representative from Colorado, it turned out well for this nachzuhaken topic. 
Neither of the two men has grave chances at the nomination but both remain in the running perhaps because they have hit on the Immigrationspauke earlier and harder than other. 
The candidates share the same views at least in the area of the immigration in the great and whole: sharper limits, intolerance opposite illegal Migranten. 
This topic helping the republicans together with fears over poisonous toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world to forget or to minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives. 
But the debate was were brought up obviously problematically as other topics. 
Mr Giuliani was asked why he has supported weapon restrictions in the past. 
John McCain and Romney discussed it whether you should regard as a torture drown feigned. 
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe the Bible every word. 
This was the reason that Giuliani supported the point of view that although the Bible is its preferential book, it perhaps literally doesn't believe the story of Jonah and the whale. 
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty. 
Mike Huckabee, Christian conservatism existing for a long time contrary to all expectations on the first place in a survey in Iowa recently carried out thanks to his now, said that the death penalty is painful but necessary. 
You pressed he laughed about it as him Jesus had too intelligently to be advertised around himself around a political office, whether Jesus would approve her, and said. 
The running remains extremely wide open. 
Huckabees advancement in Iowa falls together with Ron Paul's latest donation successes and its approval storms in the debate of Wednesday. 
These two have very shot from the trifle because, till now, the both wings of the party couldn't agree on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates yet. 
In the year 1980 and 2000 a candidate has reconciled the party from the beginning and convincing with a victorious message about the size of America and a blinking to both wings of the party. 
The party is split this time and the result by far isn't clear.
