Six deterrent small things, annoy around teammates 
E-mails which we forget to send, language news which we never receive -- harmless lies which we don't notice any more: You take "color" at work to the weekday. 
The question is, whether one himself to mere one used, or what puts this small trouble for himself consciously of the challenge and temptedly this misunderstandable, aggravating for other situations to vermweiden better. 
Tips. 
"Sorry, I have forgotten to pass on to you that somebody of the marketing department has called" -- a colleague says. 
That one has missed a meeting through this? 
At best one is sorry for and tries to line it up to make up by perhaps calling with the marketing department and confessing remorsefully one would have forgotten for the message (this is the less usual method). 
The thing is dismissed with an excuse mostly. 
With what can and try to avoid these situations consciously one prepare moments really unpleasant his colleagues before one becomes entangled in embarrassing excuses, if one should think it over? 
What doesn't to one belong himself, lent something? 
There is hardly something more sinewy as if one reaches for a document, office accessories or the telephone but it isn't here. 
The stapler lay on the desk still yesterday -- is it gone this morning? 
Or is approximately the ballpoint pen believed lost discovered on the desk of a colleague? 
One should borrow nothing from the colleagues without wonder because annoys they are if they notice that something has got away. 
So not putting any envelope or mail its from the office into the bag because they could meet one: no-one more there, if one needs it urgently anyway. 
Gossip about the private life of the colleagues? 
There is not to hold back any effective means, a gossip which was already put into the world. 
Who with whom, what done? 
Where and why? 
The information (or assumptions) shouldn't one everybody about the private life of the colleagues if possible tie to the nose! 
And if somebody opens anyway and his innermost secret betrays us, we shouldn't abuse this confidence! 
One is silent like a grave instead of, at all, not passing on this one to persons present even if others know also about the problems of the colleague at the best. 
Reported without reason illy? 
If one calls in the office to report under reference to tormenting headaches illy because one just feels unwell or simply only would like to rest, one should himself about one be in the clear one: The colleagues must finish the work of their own, nondeferrable handlings, projects with firm appointments instead of one now themselves. 
Join in in the colleagues therefore not bad! 
One knows already on the day before that one won't make it to the office the next day or that something could come between, why one must have left at home, if one should report it on time, so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are confronted with the absence unexpectedly if. 
Gesumme, giggling, make a telephone call 
One is just deepened in his work, however, is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggling of the colleagues? 
Listened in unintentionally on a telephone call which one wouldn't have been supposed to hear better? 
One shouldn't irritate the colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which one holds away over their heads), trampling, getting angry constantly or grumbling. 
All this can be very disturbing even if are not just in a task (write she plan, organize) recessed. 
Are the others always to blame? 
If a project isn't ready in due time, one has an important letter or important Nachrichte forget to send off, one shouldn't look for the fault of the forgetfulness of one's own at other! 
If possible one shouldn't finish himself speaking on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues! 
One admits his faults to himself and apologizes best if others also were concerned by it! 
Can make up the question like one mistakes make up for it or this, you attach only too missed! 
In the office, a feeling like at home? 
Track-suit trousers and Schlapfen: Has lost nothing in the office comfortable for at home, however! 
Once, one shouldn't then dress so casually if the job would allow it actually! 
Get -- alone on the whole one should respect both his colleagues and himself that one dresses in the office correspondingly -- merely not too sloppy if desired, also pretty and elegant!
