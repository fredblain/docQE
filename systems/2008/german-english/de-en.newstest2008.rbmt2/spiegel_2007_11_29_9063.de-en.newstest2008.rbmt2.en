Venus is the infernal Gemini of the earth 
Venus is more similar than thought till now despite her anti-life atmosphere of the earth: The European space probe "Venus express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind whirl to the Pole as it appears also on the earth in winter. 
For almost three decades scientists have suspected that there is lightning on Venus. 
The European probe "Venus express" has furnished the proof now, it tracked down electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoots to cloud in a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud, Christopher Russel of the University of California reports in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature". 
Having let lightning according to the famous "Ursuppen theory" arise the life on the earth: Thunderstorms shall have activated reactions in the ocean which led to the formation of amino acids, the constituents of the life. 
On Venus not so: Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington "must, if there ever were lives there, have been it in the very early history", explains. 
Might give Venus hardly something live on the surface today: The atmosphere is around one hundred times thick than on the earth, there are temperatures of 500 degrees from time to time. 
"Perhaps Venus is the devil Gemini of the earth but she is a Gemini", said Russel. 
Why Venus who is so similar to the earth in mass and size has smashed a so completely other development is the basic question of the Esa mission. 
The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research since since the beginning of the nineties no more probe was away specifically for the investigation of this planet. 
The latest research results which are introduced now in several "Nature" articles underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in opinion of the researchers within the solar system. 
"You also show that, with the earth, the things in common of our neighbor planet are greater than at first assumed", informs the Esa. 
So found cloud whirlpools also unite the researchers besides the already known whirlwind at the North Pole at the South Pole which turns still considerably faster. 
A researcher team writes around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica the phenomenon reminds of streams of air on the earthly winter hemisphere. 
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost just as big with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers. 
The planet also described as a morning or evening star revolves around the sun within almost 225 days. 
However, he concerns much more slowly himself: A Venustag lasts for 243 earth days. 
Although Venus hardly reminds of the earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees centigrade and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets have arisen under quite similar prerequisites. 
Water which remained in oceans on the earth on which Venus was, however, lost to the space accumulated on both. 
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on the earth, it agrees on Venus on the large part of the atmosphere.
