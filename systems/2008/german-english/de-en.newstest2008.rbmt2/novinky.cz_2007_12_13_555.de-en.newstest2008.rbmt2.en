Cuba, the most beautiful island of the caribbean 
For visitors it is really an island of the liberty. 
Whatever you expect from your vacation this will be realized if you select only the right thing. 
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea which is quiet like a pond. 
Palms and space including with waiters who offer pizza, ice and beguiling cocktails on the beach. 
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette. 
You find this in ample measure on the islands of the caribbean. 
Only on one the large Antilles you, however, find island still much more and Cuba is this island the great and beautiful. 
In the time of the Spaniards Cuba was the bastion for the conquest of America. 
It called Columbus the most beautiful place which has seen per a human eye. 
Havana cigar turned a store or transit camp of treasures once which the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe. 
And then the American epoch came. 
The hotel Nacional completely came into being at the end of the 20th century. 
One of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, had it because everything which was regarded as a crime in the USA (particularly during the Prohibition) was seen and supported with pleasure in Cuba build, drugs, game of chance, prostitution. 
Under his guests were and others 
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra. 
Skyscrapers grew into Havana cigar, cars which belonged to the ritual symbols of the fifties of the former Jahrhundets drove over the broad boulevards. 
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate for himself in San Francisco de Paula nearby Havana cigars and he had his yacht in Cojímar lie. 
Stars of the show business and politicians from all of America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita Del Medio. 
And today? 
You also can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana cigar. 
One mixes cocktails quite as required for you at the bar in the hotel Nacional. 
And the cult cars of the fifties go around to Havana cigar to this day because the Schigulis imported once and Fiats have fallen apart already long ago in the salty and damp air. 
One may have come down Havana cigar, particularly his oldest part, strongly, finds as many wonderful colonial sights as straight nowhere in the surroundings here. 
Other places are just decorated, for example Trinidad. 
The tourism brings money required urgently, there was green light for this development into regard on this, that. 
Within the last fifteen years new hotels haven't come into being only into Havana cigar but also in Varadero at the coast of the province Holguín and also on little islands like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others. 
Cuba still offers a quirk which is unique and attracts primarily railroad enthusiasts in the world. 
Steam and diesel operated narrow-gauge railroads took the sugar cane of remote plantations to the sugar factories. 
Your fleet of vehicles wasn't replaced over decades and one sees there funny and fully operating engines so whose contemporaries are in the museum somewhere else already. 
Destinations of the outing 
The majority of the visitors of Cuba doesn't leave the bedeutendendsten places out. 
So one must write no longer in detail about Varadero or Havana cigar. 
It only remains to mention that a museum is located in the estate of Hemingway already mentioned whose visit the one who likes this writer shouldn't miss. 
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba. 
The luxuriant vegetation grows on chalky soil. 
The Mogotas, lime hill and rock, rise steeply of the valley ground, the fertile ground by which also weathered rock areas of a thick vegetation are covered accumulated in their cavities. 
It is this valley where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is cultivated. 
In his final form you can meet him if you go to one of the cigar factories of Havana cigar. 
It possibly seems also interesting to some, that the Chilean result of the television series "major Zeman" was turned there. 
Trinidad 
An ancient town which was founded briefly after the Spaniards had colonized the island. 
The trade brought her glory and wealth with slaves and sugar. 
The wealth embodied itself in the neat beauty of the little town. 
Influences Spanish colonial architecture, strong of the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years. 
Trinidad, is such a remote place that there wasn't any street yet in the fifties of the last century there which would have put the area through to the other country, lain between the sea and the Escambray mountains. 
This insulation contributed that it remained unnoticed. 
Nothing was built there but everybody was glad that he had a roof over the head, torn off from nothing also therefore. 
One it more than an afternoon time has, is then worthwhile to look at interesting places in the surroundings for Trinidad if such as the beach playa Ancón or the "valley of the sugar factories". 
In the evening one then should go La Música into the Casa de which revives after the darkness and the music isn't where silent up to the morning. 
Baracoa 
Some completely describe this small towns as the most beautiful of the island in the east of Cuba. 
This view also is surely influenced through the way there. 
Both streets which lead of Guantánamo there had to and zerküftete mountains overcome and go by a landscape which is hardly touched by human interventions high. 
UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba in its world heir list thanks to the untouched nature there. 
The best chocolate is produced there, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it has arisen after the journeys of Columbus) about one hundred years and of the hill where the former castle, the present hotel tbsp Castillo, stands several table mountains can be seen which El Yunque is the best known. 
One could write many pages over the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra-Maestra mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos over the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the Cuban patron Caridad Del Cobre about the Santeria, an African religion which the descendants of slaves confess, over all this. 
But as one says so: Looking with eyes of one's own better.
