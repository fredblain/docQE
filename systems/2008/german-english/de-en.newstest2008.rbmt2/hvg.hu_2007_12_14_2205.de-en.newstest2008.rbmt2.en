It one wants or how will everyone fix uninterestingly for other 
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the regular morning jam. 
A strange melody resounds from the radio: The sound of a violin mated with electronic stock exchange securities. 
I turn the volume more highly. 
The speed changes, a female choir the bass comes to the previous sounds and as a real sound jewel. 
It is the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar which resounds on mr2. 
The local music scene hasn't spoiled us with qualitative Electropop long time at all. 
One sees even the jam but now differently if one hears the new album of Zagar. 
The garage skirt with its Gitarrengequitsche contributes a new and exciting production from the local digital Underground scene slowly the seem, and even if again "into" is, which proves local Electropop of Yonderboi, so some to a change of the overall picture: There is something new under the sun. 
Balázs Zságer it has begun in Pécs, played instruments even in the band Yonderboi before perhaps because a pub doesn't stand two pipers -- started with its own way to follow. 
He made the breakthrough with its project (Zagar) and its music which merges elements from jazz, electronic and pop but had approached only as one with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film to him (e.g. 
"Szezon" of Ferenc Török). 
The formation which at first had appeared in smaller clubs became under only known to the wider audience, as the magazine "wan2" the its first album from the year 2002 top strung 50 local albs and Zagar chose a marketable trendsetter together with Yonderboi to the almost only one also in the west. 
Zagar and his band undoubtedly were "trendy", however, no-one was interested in knowing whether they also like to bear this brand. 
The band has reacted as it should: With a new, even better album. 
The new album with the title having been published now tumble Fly Instead " Cannot " could open up ways new to them, the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years, though. 
The expression originates namely from the time when Balázs Zságer was still away with another band. 
The airy, flying allusion would be also all right louder guitar, the influences, these fall besides the ethereal character of the music, though the rock 'n' roll open, corresponding to the Zeitgeist and the trends. 
With these songs the singer living in England and working with the band "The jigsaw puzzle", György Ligeti, has introduced himself to the premiere in the Millenáris. 
A song of the album has created it even for the radio pop song -- since latest of early till late pop music sending to it mr2 Petofi has gradually set the listeners the earwig with the number "Wings of Love" which was taken by six local singers ("Underground stars") under cooperation. 
Everything OK so? 
The hvg.hu has enquired at Balázs Zságer. 
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far is your music reserved for a certain layer? 
Balázs Zságer: The concept "layer music" doesn't mean much to me at all. 
In my opinion gives two castes in the pop music and to be more precise not Mainstream and Underground or alternative and pop but commercial and honest. 
Alone the so-called alternative or Underground music can be shallow and meaningless, be able to do her but be produced also only for the sale which makes her to commercial music just the same. 
A good pop number also can arise from an honest motive. 
The receptiveness of the listener works independently of languages and national boundaries also according to this principle. 
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign audience opposite your music? 
B. Zs. The pop music has particularly a greater tradition west of us abroad. 
Only teenagers or persons in the twenties don't go to concerts but also the older audience there. 
You follow up the trends in the pop music much more attentively which happen around it because they also regard it as a part of the contemporary culture. 
hvg.hu: Which role befits the audience at your work? 
Is it, important whom, where, how many listen to your music? 
B. Zs. Of course it is a good feeling to see that more always come to our concerts. 
However, we have never composed for the market. 
With us the music doesn't arise to serve a purpose but for a certain reason. 
The role of the audience is noticeable at the concerts mostly where there already is a mutual interaction but in turn there is this one only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment. 
I have nevertheless noticed one: If you want to make it to everyone right, you are no longer interesting. 
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi? 
It is away as a soloist and its career rather has built up in the west. 
B. Zs. We don't really go its way that one again and again tempted, this in our music hineinzuinterpretieren, completely except for it. 
We see each other sooner than team player, which on the musical presence of the different one let trust and it develop. 
At first comparisons of our work with it of Yonderboi were unavoidable of course since several get from us from its band and have taken another way. 
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petofi suits "Wings of Love" in first place. 
Many have belonged to the names Zagar only in connection with this number. 
Was the opening staged with an a little more popular style in the direction of conscious of a wider audience? 
B. Zs. We didn't have any plans to write a hit which then shall suffer for the album as a carthorse. 
In this song it is all about more. 
It was thought as a final of the album with which we wanted to resolve the sound orgy and the a little more difficult topics. 
hvg.hu: How have you selected the six singers? 
What was the conducting principle why exactly her? 
B. Zs. It was the basic idea to make a gospel song like choir. 
The idea of arranging the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene then came. 
So Edina Kutzora is Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Eniko Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh the choir of six come into being, therefore Sena, , which then we have christened apäter "Underground stars". 
hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song just the same or has it co-formed the girls? 
B. Zs. There already was the number in the instrumental version longer but when the material was ready for the album, we imagined that this number still "needs something." 
The Akkordenabfolge has really asked for a song voice. 
I still have one sung the melody in the same night, she has learned the girls later. 
Everything came practically onto straight off and alarming spontaneously. 
I can remember, I was electrified quite at that time but it also has already required the "stars". 
The song would alone with my voice never have got so firm. 
hvg.hu: However, one had the impression both on the plate and at the concert the girls would be in the background. 
There isn't any solo share (except for the short solo of Judy Jay), they don't have a role of their own, their song sings completely together and isn't louder than the music therefore isn't only accompanied by the music. 
They stood behind also on the stage. 
Is it intention? 
B.Zs. It was that way because of purely technical problems that they have stood behind. 
We didn't want to send them solo roles consciously, though. 
In the number it also is all about that these determined grand pianos, the grand pianos of the love emporheben, us that where who shall from forget his ego a little come, forgotten, and where is away, we simply allow one. 
I would like that others also feel this euphoric condition which we have felt when the song has arisen. 
hvg.hu: Which one was the most effortful song? 
B. Zs. Actually the musical Schaffensarbeit rather has none at all, it at given more difficult tasks when mixing. 
Longer, where the groove didn't want " rock 'n' roll Goes To, The girls, " to work for example at "Dorian Gray's dilemma" in which I play on a concert piano or at, but after and after everything has joined himself together as in the case of a jigsaw puzzle. 
hvg.hu: Which one is your favorite number of the new album? 
B. Zs. This changes with the concerts constantly and also now where I have the album "losgelasssen". 
At present, it is "prophet Is A Fool" escape From Never, " The Earth "and the number" The seed ".
