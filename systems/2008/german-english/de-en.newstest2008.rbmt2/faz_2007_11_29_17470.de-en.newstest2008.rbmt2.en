These aren't Warhols boxes 
Thinks to Ikea who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden box but not to Andy Warhol. 
Or anyway? 
At present, wooden boxes produced in Sweden are throwing dark shade on Warhols work list. 
Fakes are a large part of the ninety-four Brillo boxings of the "type Stockholm" listed there. 
After the Swedish newspaper "expresses" has stirred doubt about the genuineness of Andy Warhols Brillo boxings of the year 1968 up some months ago, internal investigations are arriving at a conclusion sobering up in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now: The six "Brillo-Boxes" which former museum director Pontus Hultén has bequeathed to the Moderna Museet 1995 as a gift, copies and well are also the large part of the another about one hundred Brillo boxings of the "type Stockholm", these on the international art market into circulation are. 
The past history is more artistically chaining confusing nested, one and kuratorischer productions. 
Warhol created its first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes which are based on the red blue white design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo", in New York in 1964. 
An exhibition of his work in the Moderna Museet 1968 exhibited hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard with Warhols consent: These weren't (from reasons of cost) of Warhol but were delivered directly from the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik. 
It wasn't works of art but around the examples around bare exhibits. 
At the same time, Warhol 1968 has given the permission well to let some few Brillo wooden boxes which weren't exhibited in the Moderna Museet, though produce in Sweden. 
Contemporary witnesses are talking now about about fifteen boxes which have rightly gone down in art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol Brillo-Boxes with the name "type Stockholm" at that time. 
More than 100 000 dollars have obtained some of them on auctions. 
It is the problem now about one hundred wooden boxes which Warhol then has left to it have been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968 that legendary museum director Pontus Hultén has claimed wrongly later. 
Hulténs 105 boxes were only 1990 actually produced in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg. 
Warhol was already three years dead at this time. 
Lars Byström, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, also has examined three next to Brillo-Boxes museum characteristic of six from a Swedish private property, which two 1968 were made in Stockholm: Your pressing chipboards were undercoated first and, abgeschmirgelt, white oil-based paint was applied with a brush after that. 
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 however tells that the color was served with a painter role without flat coat directly on the pressing chipboard -- it in addition isn't around oil, pick out around acrylic paint. 
These boxes "weren't authorized by the artist and should be removed by the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes", indicates the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "'Andy Warhol kind of Authentication board' doesn't come to another end in New York, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material if this." 
These spare, in July, the Authentication board has admittedly announced to follow the "heavy accusations" in the area of the soap powder boxes are raised. 
But one remains silent there since then.
