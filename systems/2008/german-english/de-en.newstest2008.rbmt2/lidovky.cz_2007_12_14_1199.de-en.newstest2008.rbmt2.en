Budget is through 
Yes, it is done. 
The national budget is approved. 
What is special at this household? 
It is the first household which this government has designed and which was accepted by the coalition majority without support of the opposition. 
This one for the current year still was approved with support of the CSSD (social democrats) because secretary Sobotka had him presented (of this party) and the CSSD couldn't permit itself therefore to decline him. 
As opposed to the lively debate before the coordination on the motion of 'no confidence' against the government nothing dramatic happened this time. 
The parliament approved this traditionally little observed, nevertheless most meaningful law at due leisure. 
This is so to speak paradoxical. 
Rules over everything starts and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the household whether one likes this or not. 
The household is an essential component of the politics, however, is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition. 
This is a more grateful topic for the media and therefore they pay more attention to him. 
A quarrel under politicians is much more interesting than bare numbers for the public. 
The national budgets suffered at the former social-democratic governments from three weak points which the household cannot remove suddenly for the year 2008: 
The first is, of the high share of expenditure this one is obliging because of law in which it the pensions isn't only but also around social expenditure which the "silent" coalition has concluded of CSSD and KSCM (Communists) last year before the elections. 
The second is the budgetary policy in deficit as a result of the first weak point. 
The third restriction consists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities. 
The greatest risk, however, isn't the state budget deficit. 
This household is public and one javelin measures under control. 
However, a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities. 
Many mayors often distributed rashly to develop further sources apart from takings from taxes, taxes and bank loans for investments debentures by which they were responsible for their city halls in excess. 
Within the last few years they managed to pay these debts off by sale of shares of the energy and different one supply grids which had got them in the train of the privatization from the state on a massive scale. 
This source has already dried up now. 
As far as we only hold on to official and verifiable facts, we notice that: 
our economy already for some years, like the rest of the world, a growth phase passes,  without the CSSD this one refrain himself boasts. 
This represented a single opportunity for her governments, to fix the public finances. 
These governments were, however, still more responsible for the state instead. 
Other countries, except for a couple of exceptions like Hungary Albania, Pakistan or Egypt have economized much more sensibly than our republic. 
This is a giant disgrace which has to be ascribed to the former governments mainly. 
We belong to the countries which are threatened by poverty least, seen in the global scale. 
Therefore no nassiven social programs which unfortunately were inflated quite superfluously in a gigantic extent just within the last few years are necessary. 
Even if it has turned out well to cut a part of the nonsensical populistic expenditure which was adopted this year before the elections is clear that if it doesn't come to a moving of the pension admission age and to a reform of pensions in the near future, any politics then ends practically in this country and, who is identically on the power, will it have nothing as managing purely. 
It is exaggerated only easily if one says that ruling politicians then turn into officials who mechanically divide the largest portion of the tax revenue up on pensions and social expenditure. 
Therefore this year's household cannot be a revolution but can put a stop to only the superseding of normal expenditure by duty expenditure. 
The deficit provided for 2008 of 70 billion crowns definitely wouldn't be governments superfluously, if earlier would have distributed, what went only within the last ten years. 
If we don't want that it really comes to that, that ruling politicians turn into pure civil servants, then we must be patient and wish this not too strong coalition government, however, which is conscious of this one that the state can spend much only in such a way as it is able to take to taxes and charges quiet at the preparations for broader reform laws. 
Only these make a gradual putting through of a balanced national budget possible.
