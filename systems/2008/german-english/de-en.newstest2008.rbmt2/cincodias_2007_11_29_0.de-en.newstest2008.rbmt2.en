Is a final annual Rally for the stock exchange still to come? Disagreement with the experts due to the U.S. mortgage crisis 
With almost five weeks up to the annual accounts of the stock exchange the investors already rub their hands with regard to the coming final annual Rally. 
The experts regarding this nevertheless cannot make any sure forecasts. 
Banif thinks that?looks purely statistically, the month is usually accompanied by a positive market trend at the stock exchange Decembers 
It nevertheless isn't advisable to make forecasts of statistics at short notice and only on the basis. Tensions to be taken if serious don't determine the current market event primarily then 
Although other experts don't approve of a such firm rise in prices within the last weeks of the year these say nevertheless that the stock exchange quotation is certainly liquidity of the market and the market participant given the of?. These invest mainly in fixed-interest funds due to the lack of safe share funds, which is concerned by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend towards productive assets strongly. 
The stock exchange will therefore rather show a course trend in opinion of these experts which is rather lateral and influenced by market fluctuations, ? primarily because we cannot assess the extents of the possible fall in the interest rate of the U.S. central bank yet, an uncertainty these primarily on the increased crude oil price and to lead the danger of the increase in the rate of inflation back is. 
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees, that with that it is a daring time to announce a forthcoming market Rally. 
The chances don't stand the expert insures??, very well. 
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its maximum brand on November 8th from 15,945.7 points. 
But all experts don't share the same negative opinion. 
In opinion of Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could, the year successfully with almost 16,000 points complete because of the restructuring of the investment funds and the subsidizing of the pension register which is traditional and carried out around this time every year. 
The expert nevertheless stresses that the things could develop this year a little differently; primarily due to the final annual Rally taking place already in the second December week and therefore directly after the bridge day to the day of the constitution. 
In opinion of the analyst the price fluctuations wouldn't influence the market trends. 
The previous judgements are to the market situation on an almost technical standard, in the opinion of Federico Olucha, analyst at the bench Inversis, what could lead, that a deviation of the index values could stand out soon, the extents depended on the results of the U.S. mortgage market crisis. 
The analyst trusts, that on this these turn out positive. 
At the choice of the values which shall advance the Ibex to new maximum amounts the analysts agree. 
Solana of Intermoney declares that it is?this year the great values' turn. 
The expert would count the two big banks and some property companies as one of the value winners, ? the current sector will be too expensive at the given time there. 
Assure Federico Olucha of the bench Inversis meanwhile that the increases in connection with the bank and industry sector will walk along. 
If the Rally actually happens, the property companies will profit from it. 
The ACS was on on fetching course within the last months and we hope that other property companies like Ferrovial and FCC take the same way?, so the expert. 
Periodical consumption will determine the market event with regard to the increased consumerism during the Christmas Days in the last half year. 
On the other hand the expert thinks that the technologies also will achieve positive sales results even if they are represented on the Spanish market only in a low number. 
Five times within seven years 
Within the last seven years December showed sinking developments of course only in two cases. 
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and this one initiated a last real final annual rally simultaneously till now. 
December showed a rise in prices of 6.68% this year in which the Ibex 35 made up time by 28.17 percentage points. 
2008 in consequence becomes the fifth profitable year the Ibex (has) increased by 8.36% since January and can produce an Endjahresrally also, will let itself be seen whether.
