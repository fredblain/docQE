Banks want to cope with crisis 
The American Federal reserve and the European central bank of Great Britain, the Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight against the crisis together on the finance markets. 
So more than 100 billion dollars will reach the currency markets with the help of auctions. 
On these auctions the banks auction interest rates at which they are ready to lend each other money. 
The American Fed for example sends 40 billion dollars on auction, it forks further 24 out for the European and the Swiss Central Bank. 
It is after the stops of September 11th the first time that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinate procedure for the defense or Abmilderung of the results of a financial crisis. 
This step shall remove the greatest difficulties of the economy "therefore" the increasing lack of freely available capital which the banks can award Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report for his customers. 
"The coordinate action of the central banks" has, Baumohl added in its report to do the probability of a recession in the USA from 65% to about 50% reduced. 
The banks have already lost by 60 billion dollars because of not used loans primarily in the United States. 
Analysts expect even further billion losses. 
"The central banks really must have been afraid of it ", what still everything can follow when procedures decided on it " the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies, said. 
"It looks so that the situation is really bad", he further said. 
The central banks have the fears, that if the banks have access to loans themselves, loans also get more expensive for their customers. 
This would reduce consumption and throw the American economy into a recession possibly with effects on the economic growth in the whole world. 
The central banks have decided after they hadn't succeeded, the so-called LIBOR abzusenken, the Londoner interbank interest rate which is used between banks at the financial rental company. 
This means that the banks were permanently afraid to lend each other money and this although their interest rates had abgesenkt for the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the fall repeatedly. 
"This will have the same effect as another lowering of the interest rates", told Greg Salvaggio of tense to Consulting of the agency of Reuter. 
Some analysts are the opinion that this step of the central banks towards the on-heating of the crisis contributes because it doesn't solve the fundamental problem and to be more precise the case of the property market in the USA.
