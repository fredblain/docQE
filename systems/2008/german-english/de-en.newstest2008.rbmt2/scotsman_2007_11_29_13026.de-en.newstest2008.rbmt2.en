The climate on Venus could have a view of the future of the earth recognized 
Perhaps Venus was once a pleasant place for the life, scientists said yesterday. 
Data of one on an orbit of a situated European spaceship show it was when till now conscious that the planet is like a twin of the earth turned away still more. 
Venus is the sewing Estonian planetary neighbor of the earth. 
The two worlds have approximately the same size and have similar planetary orbits, is a little closer to Venus of the sun, though. 
In front of billions of years had there been conditions on Venus, which would have been very similar on these on the earth and would have been able to even be habitable, think today scientists. 
But because of the without breaking carbon dioxide greenhouse effect the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotation speed smashed development course Venus unite completely others. 
The planet is robbed by water today and a surface temperature which is heiss enough has to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane violent winds and lightning storms. 
The knowledge of the space probe Venus express of the European space agency planned this one, for a year this one has examined, offer a look sobering up at it as the earth could develop in view of the disastrous climate changes. 
Professor Fred Taylor from the department physics of the University of Oxford, one of the heads the Venus express mission, said: "It gets clear why the climate is so different to that one of the earth on Venus while the planets otherwise are rather similar." 
"Our new data make it possible possibly with a habitable environment to design a scenario in which Venus has started ahead of billions of years like the earth."
