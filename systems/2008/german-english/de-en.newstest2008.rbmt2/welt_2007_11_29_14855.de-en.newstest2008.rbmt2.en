Of Beust reaps criticism for Olympia refusal 
Moving the mayor of the application of Hamburg for Olympic summer Games away has met with intense criticism in politics and economy. 
Many want to fight for the games further at the water. 
But of Beust realism sends a reminder to the assessment of the chances. 
The general executive manager of the Board of Trade Hamburg, Hans Jörg Schmidt Trenz, didn't describe a renunciation as " good for the industrial location " on Wednesday. 
No other project has developed such big motivation strengths in the town as the Olympiaidee quite recently. 
"Without this aim the sports political swing wouldn't be in the position to be maintained in the same measure." 
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate not to bury the project but to find a new long-term approach for this "which starts out from a changed time beam." 
Mayor Ole of Beust kept to earlier statements on Wednesday, after what the Olympiaambitionen Hamburgss are unrealistic at least up to the year 2028. 
Olympiabewerbung but the German Olympic sports federation decides, on one " not Hamburg " world online said of Beust. 
He referred to the decision of the sports federation expected for the beginning of December over an application of Munich for the Winter Games 2018. 
"This preference means for us that in this no realistic chances will angedachten time period us have from us to 2028 till now." 
The dream nevertheless wasn't from dreamt for all time said of Beust. 
The Hamburg sports federation (HSB) was sorry for the statements of Beusts. 
By the fact that Hamburg doesn't want to apply any more for Olympic Games within the next 25 years the impression is given. 
"It is too early to obstruct itself a chance by one burying the plans already at this time", said HSB president Günter Ploß on Wednesday. 
Moreover, a renunciation of the application contradicts the statement of the senate boss on the occasion of a reception concerning the general meeting of the general German high school sport association. 
There 2015 has described the application of Hamburg "not as a substitute" of Beust for the Universiade for Olympic Games in Hamburg. 
The high school sport association had nominated Hamburg as an applicant town only last week. 
The SPD citizens parliamentary group reproached the senate for having not used valuable time for the house building in Hamburg. 
The little boy's Grasbrooks has been delayed by the senate for years because it has put Olympia and left the house building aside on the card, " the development " the SPD representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast said. 
While SPD for the little boy Grasbrook has always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later living use has put CDU on the "event factor" one-sided. 
The application for the Olympic summer Games 2012 had aroused a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at that time. 
Hamburg had failed because of Leipzig, though.
