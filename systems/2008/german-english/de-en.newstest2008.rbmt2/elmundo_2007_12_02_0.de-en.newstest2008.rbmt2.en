A colleague informs about the admission of illegal Internet downloads to the Criminal Code: 
A., the download of a song would be a law break, with six months custody which becomes betraft. 
If you but re-rum rob a music business below a value of 400 euros, this is only then regarded as a simple violation (article 623.1). 
The theft then becomes as Straftateingestuft if you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, B. although the punishment nevertheless turns out less than at a download (article 234, Criminal Code). 
C. you a car nick and it give back forty hours later again, the punishment is still then less than at a download (article 244.1) if.

A prison sentence from three to 12 months draws after itself (article 154, Criminal Code) to participate in a rebellious discussion, during which data exchange has an imprisonment from six months up to two years the consequence 
(article 270, Criminal Code). 
E. after the article 184.2 of the Criminal Code becomes sexual annoyance as looked less badly as the download of a DVD film at work from the Internet.

My family doctor presents me one of his long, strange research articles with the title: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas primarily if the other get more of this?. 
Therefore the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment are dependent on the salary of the colleagues. 
The study was prepared with the help of a tomographisch magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the last issue of the science magazine Science. 
The activation was the strongest then if the participant gave correct answers and his con-player, however, failed according to statement Bernd of Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life & Brain?. 
The researchers could recognize that the brain activities always turned out very moderate when both participants were with their answer right and therefore also got the same salary; but if one got the double from them, it also added to a stronger brain activity. 
I am not quite sure whether it requires actually so much scientific effort to reach such a result.
