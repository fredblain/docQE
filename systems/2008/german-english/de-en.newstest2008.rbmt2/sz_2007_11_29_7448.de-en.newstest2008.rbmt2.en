In the empire of Angela Wolke 
The unrealistic appearance of the chancellor documented, that the coalition is as regards content at the end and that nothing more has to be expected by it itself. 
In which country does this Federal Chancellor live actually? 
After her hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag which was wurschtig and meaningless one must say: not here -- not in the country which must finally be ruled over by it. 
Angela Merkel has rejected the reproach that she concentrates on the foreign policy too much with a terribly arrogant sentence. 
This is provincial, she said and showed with that first that she doesn't want to understand about what it is for the critics. 
She has become evident in the Bundestag recognizably for everyone as the reproach is very correct. 
Concrete interest still even to feel a feeling was in the country for the problems there. 
Angela Wolke presented itself instead: a lifted politician who flees in the foreign policy and stays there in the approximate one herself. 
Example climate protection: She praises herself without breaking for the decisions of saint dam, however, doesn't say how the climate goals shall be accomplished in this country there. 
The self praise still would so much have the CDU boss denied herself to Unbescheidenheit two years ago at all. 
She clings to the set phrase, that now the upswing arrives with the people. 
It damages its image as a pragmatist instead of the world sch√∂nzureden with that who solves problems. 
But domestic problems are a side issue in the empire of Angela Wolke. 
Child poverty and the worries of the low wage-earners? 
She has a couple of subordinate clauses for it. 
Is characteristic how often she makes a mistake as it around the child surcharge goes. 
Merkel needs three attempts there to bring out a partly even sentence. 
She stumbles like on a strange land if it gets concrete.
