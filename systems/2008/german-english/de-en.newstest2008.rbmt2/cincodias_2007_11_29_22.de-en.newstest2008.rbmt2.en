The Spanish independent radio Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and therefore overtakes its rival Antena 3. 
We have made it?. 
With this sentence the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, made his satisfaction known at the stock market close. The transmitter escorted by him had his value around the double one his increases rivals Antena 3. 
An aspect, however, dampened his joy: This is exactly?what me this is injured; it didn't state a higher growth, that we, but that we had lower losses?,. 
It emphasized that she hasn't sunk too deeply?despite the weak market. 
Telecinco ended the day with a positive balance of 2.54% yesterday. 
This profit decreases its previous this year's losses on 15.66%. 
According to information from Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4,488.88 million euros now in which Mediaset checks the main share of the capital (52%) and Vocento is involved only with 13%. 
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has to register a loss of altogether 40.5% since January so that his market value amounts to the half with 2,193.46 million. 
The market value of other listed communication enterprises, however, increases; in the case of Sogecable on 3,571 million at Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) on 2,518.53 million and at Vocento on 1,779 million. 
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that himself?it is two similar enterprises?, so Vasile. 
The question on which scale we can actually stock exchange technically proceed uncertainly still turns up for which price and how we can design it lucrative on customer level. 
Telecinco explained its plan a week ago to climb to the first TV station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue this year. This assured the advertising enterprise of the group of Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña. 
If the plan should be realized, the transmitter would increase its advertising earnings in comparison with the 965.4 million by 3.6% from the previous year. 
In the case of Antena 3 the net sales increased (up to 734.4 million) by 1.6% within the first nine stock exchange months while the net earnings could show only an increase in 0.7% (630.4 million) out of the watching TV business. 
The analysts see the main factor for the stock exchange course better in the comparison of Telecinco which the company could show until present time Payout reason at the high one: The enterprise escorted by Alejandro Echevarría arranged for a 100 per cent dividend payout in 2006. 
Vasile assures, however, that still could vary the reason after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol with Mediaset as a parent company even if it is still too early for an official announcement. 
We are obliged to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares out even if we have shown off always considerably more till now?. 
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year whose share values we could already increase by the purchase of 33% of the Endemol shares. 
According to statement of the analysts the market is showing certain loss trends at present. 
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced his profit calculation by 7% at Telecinco for this year by 4% and for 2009. 
This is the result of the cut in the expected rate of increase which will decline in 2008 from 10.5% to 8.4% and in 2009 from 5.5% to 5.1%. 
This also has reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
