VTi test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6: Voruteile fade 
To say the truth I was never a special fan the Peugeot 206. 
Many weren't worth his handling characteristics, one could describe the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the processing as rather below average. 
Now but his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market and this one is better around much. 
Opinion to revise thinks the station wagon with the name SW is still a piece further and I only have left. 
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of 207, I had to complain about the too low head liberty on the backseats for example. 
These troubles exist the bodywork no more, then now the station wagon is so arranged that two meter men won't even suffer. 
Fast further 
I only go through the interior décor briefly to not repeat myself too much. 
It is a quite excellent design where I have objections only because of the wretched middle tunnel. 
I would welcome a little more designerische design there where otherwise the car makes such an elegant impression. 
The seats are comfortable and are the times past where perhaps we complained about too short seats or head-rests. 
The side hold also has itself opposite this 206 fundamentally improves. 
What the room supply concerns, one can feel the extended measurements of the bodywork also here. 
The lack of head liberty already mentioned is also removed in the station wagon. 
Suitcase into the trunk 
However, the main thing at this car is the cargo hold. 
I must describe this one as very good (also because of the folding rear window) loading in cash and space-savingly. 
The cavities are equipped with safety harnesses which represent an ideal compromise. 
You don't disturb apart ache and hold also heavier objects tight be able to. 
But we talk about the loading up volume. 
Table is 428 liters loudly in the basic equipment, what is a rather average value in comparison with the competition. 
Vehicle of this class, the Skoda Fabia Combi, most not sold in comparison with this in Czechia though. 
The 207 compares SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we we establish if stays behind that the Peugeot around clear noticeable 52 liters. 
For a foreign vacation or loading a baby carriage this value is already critical. 
But to stress the Positiva I still must this one after folding the pillions down mention very flat cargo hold or also the very low loading up edge. 
120 hp in four rows 
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with cubic capacity 1.6 liters and a performance of 88 kW. 
And a 1600-Kubik engine which drives a family Hatchback should look so, said honestly. 
He is quiet, has a low consumption and moves away well. 
If I compare him with his counterpart at Skoda which sometimes works as if his exhaust were stopped up with a rag, then I only can be filled with enthusiasm by him. 
The price list speaks volumes 
The price of this car isn't traditional at all. 
However, we must remember that we have tested a car equipped well with a spacious Innneren and a very good engine. 
The basic price of the car with the 1400s gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns still comes on. 
With our engine it costs as of 410900 crowns what is already quite a lot. 
The equipment quality of the test car beats with 80000 crowns in addition to beech once again. 
We had head airbags, automatic air conditioner, automatic windshield wiper triggering, electrical window controls and and ... behind, though 
So the car costs simple 531900 crowns, altogether. 
One this is a crowd but you calculate once the additional equipment Fabia together and you want to arrive at a quite similar sum. 
Therefore only remains the decision which brand one wants to choose.
