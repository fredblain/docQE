Disinfectants in many places are saved up for 
This year more than one thousand infections were registered in hospitals which could be explained by improper dealing with antibiotics. 
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the over-load of the staff, aren't good at all everything for checking the infections -- factors, these, so the leading woman doctor of the national epidemiology center. 
In many places you economize also at the disinfectants. 
A MRSA infection was diagnosed in the Traumatologie department of the János hospital recently. 
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was admitted to the hospital after a serious accident. 
The patient was isolated. 
At the beginning of the year there already was a similar infection. 
The injured of a serious car accident was the man had dismissed, little to return with a MRSA infection out of the hospital later, though. Since then, an important operation couldn't be carried out yet because of the bacterium which still is in the body of the patient. 
Until December 10th this year infections triggered out of hospitals 1094 by multi-resistant pathogenes were reported to the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system, so the leading woman doctor of the national epidemiology center, Karolina Böröcz. 
So so many infections triggered by multi-resistant pathogenes were registered certainly in the hospitals, however, the number of unrecorded cases might be higher. 
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to Methicillin-Oxacillin. 
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carry approximately a third of the people in its nose without it wanting to cause an illness. 
SA conditional infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) usually react to antibiotics well, they are curable well. 
If the means are measured out too highly or used improperly, though, arises from the good respondierenden bacteria antibiotics resistant, which spreads fast under corresponding conditions in the hospitals. 
Immune system which is particularly with patients weakened or working badly durably, or these bacteria can patients with a low weight cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood-poisoning, that is sepsis, but also into old. 
According to the medical head of the János hospital the MRSA infection is nothing special, such occurrences are part of sick person house everyday life. 
One mustn't mistake the infection for the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi -- there is not MRSA only there where it isn't looked for. 
Resistant to antibiotics 
Such patients are ", isolated this nursing staff wears rubber gloves and masks at the supply and we dispose of the antibiotics necessary for the treatment " -- so Tibor Nyulasi. 
At their admission to the hospital the patients are examined for MRSA, an infection cannot nevertheless always be avoided. 
Samplings too rare 
The majority of the infections in hospitals triggered by MRSA would be avoidable, the conditions ruling at present and circumstances are unfavorable for the checking of the origin or the spreading of the multi-resistant pathogene, though, Karolina Böröcz says. 
After this infection happens predominant in hospitals and old people's homes the Spitäler should examine the delivered patients and MRSA immediately infected isolate. 
The microbiological sampling is not so frequently practiced, however, in the Hungarian hospitals. 
Not least because there aren't any subsidies for this examination on the part of the state health insurance company. 
Most cases would come only then to the daylight, if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, so the medical leader of the epidemiology center. 
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations for the corresponding application of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there, however, are guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes also in Hungary. 
Antibiotic therapies shall be purposefully, this means microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the means can form, this directive isn't always observed by hospitals either, though. 
Microbiological samplings are even still more seldom the basic support of situated patient, so Karolina Böröcz, under the itinerant ones, or himself in. 
You economize at the disinfectants 
A scientific proof proves that MRSA from a patient is most frequently assigned to the other ones by the nursing staff. 
The Händewaschen or wearing gloves and masks just therefore are of a great importance, there also are considerable defects in the hospitals in this field, though. 
MRSA is transferred by droplet infection or contact, however, there isn't always the possibility in the local hospitals of isolating the infected patient. 
The rooms are even often overcrowded although meter should a distance of at least 1.5 it give between them from the epidemiological view, the beds strung pressedly for each other. 
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz further says it even happens there are few male nurses, many patients, in the hospitals supplied financially less well that everything is economized at disinfectants -- factors which virtually favor the emergence of infections. 
Such infections are provably far less frequent there or the further distribution of the pathogene can be held back where these protective measures are adhered to, so Karolina Böröcz. 
Government program against MRSA 
Health insurances cause this one enormous costs, to get a grip on MRSA infections they are therefore fought everywhere. 
The prevention of MRSA or its checking was held tight in the government program in England for example. 
According to first symptoms is the program successfully -- as published data verifies, is declining in England the trend of the MRSA infections. 
The European center for illness prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the origin of multi-resistant pathogenes also MRSA (under this), as well as the prevention declared one of its priorities by infections in hospitals.
