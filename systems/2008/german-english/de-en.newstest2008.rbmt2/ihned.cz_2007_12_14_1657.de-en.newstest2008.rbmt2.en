Debts grow

The average due date of the national debts increased to 6.5 years. 
"The complete fault increased by 13 per cent from the first one over the year up to the third quarter, what is really much in view of this one as the economy is well. 
It is interesting that growing can be recorded at the debentures primarily where the increase amounts to 20 per cent. 
The data it is bad that the debts increase but on the other hand this shows that one can do something already before the reform of pensions comes " commented on spade ossa.
