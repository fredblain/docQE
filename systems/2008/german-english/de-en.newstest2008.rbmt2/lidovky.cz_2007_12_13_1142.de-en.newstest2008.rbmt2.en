According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava actor he has used the name "Walachischer king" as the first but the project had a team around Tomás Harabis in interaction with this in long-standing work built up. 
Today, Polívka didn't take part in the negotiation. 
According to his advocate the thing probably isn't completed with that, however, and his client will well lodge an appeal. 
The quarrel goes therefore that Mr Harabis and his team want to participate in the popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitically, said advocate after the negotiation Polívkas. 
Everyone just introduced himself to the words "Walachisches kingdom" these actor and comedian.

He said financial obtaining and concepts of the activities, ". 
According to him the cause is quarrel about money. 
"After years they have noticed that the project is successful and that they also could have something of this. 
You want to win at our work parasitically, " he passed on. 
Lucrative business 
According to the court Polívka used the name "Walachischer king" in one of its television programs for the first time. 
The actor Radoslav Brzobohat ý crowned him in 1993. 
At that time, however, this wasn't connected with the intention to justify a fictitious kingdom. 
For some years, later, Harabis came onto the thought of distributing walachische passports. 
From an originally droll action a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, then attached the foundation of the company "Walachisches kingdom" to the Harabis. 
In 1997 Polívka agreed to the use of its name and its signature in the passports and offered her owners even reductions at the visit of its farm and its performances. 
Who will sit on the throne? 
The judge led today, too, that Harabis used only the bare idea which has made Polívka publicly in the shipment of "ring" for its entrepreneurial intentions. 
"The popularity Polívkas has helped the project for certain of the walachischen kingdom", said the judge.

This one lasted for the cooperation for estranged parties up to the year 2000 today when Harabis organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín. 
The disputes started to occur increasingly between Polívka and Harabis, " saint " King Boleslavs I. voted for until this with themselves never flax day since then, however, these in the withdrawal culminated. 
The leading role then took up on suggestion Harabiss Jarmila Suláková as Königinmutter.

The competition prepared by Harabis could deprive clarity in the quarrel of the throne and half a princess. 
A new king should result from it. 
He didn't want to betray details and an appointment yet. 
"We want to rush nothing. 
Something like that should be like the king move in the Walachei. 
The king should be elected for a particular time. 
Mr Polívka also can apply at it safely, " Harabis added.
