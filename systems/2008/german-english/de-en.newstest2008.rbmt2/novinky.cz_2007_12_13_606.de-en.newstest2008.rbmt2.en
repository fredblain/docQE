Integration of Slovakian pupils to britschen schools is not successful 
The number of children gains from countries of Eastern Europe in British schools which arouses worries about the further development of the local school system in the natives. 
The integration of the east Europeans meets with a number of obstacles till now. 
British schools establish even cases where disputes gain in violence between the immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants. 
The case of North Kent illustrates the problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe to britschen schools aptly where the discussions increase gradually between the natives and Slovakian immigrants. 
Quarrellings, harassments and scraps under pupils have transferred themselves to the relations between the parents. 
The situation has already developed so far that the police arrested a Slovakian woman in Chatham who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar. 
The accused defended himself, that with that the boy has offended her by racialist insults. 
Two of juvenile girls had the police to step in on a Slovakian immigrant also after an attack. 
The girls had made allegedly racialist remarks and thrown stones at him opposite the man. 
"When we went home, a boy climbed a bus cottage and spat on us. 
When I told him he should stop another unpleasant occurrence he threw apples and pears at us and laid bare then his buttocks, " a nut of Slovakian pupils described the newspaper The Timeses. 
Troubles come from the two sides. 
One of the natives even described the quarrel with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as an over-life fight. 
The specified cases attest the fact that the atmosphere gets tenser and tenser between natives and immigrants at British schools. 
70000 Slovaks who came onto looking for work here are reported in Great Britain. 
About 30000 Slovakian pupils therefore attend British schools.
