Chávez switches the watches over 
In Venezuela, the watches tick soon differently than in the rest of the world. 
President Hugo Chávez has the timekeepers reversed in the South American country by half an hour on December 9th. 
Chávez becomes in the meantime a joke figure in Spain. 
As the Official Bulletin of Venezuela informed, the watches are adjusted to the universal time minus four and a half hours according to a new law. 
The südamerikansiche state gets a time zone with that which there is not in any other country of the world. 
Among other things the USA hostile Chávez justified his decision, that with that the United States of the world would have imposed the division into time zones at full hours. 
Moreover, Chávez terminated Colombia the breaking off of the relations to the neighboring country announced because of a hostage affair on Wednesday (local time). 
The on the left nationalist said as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe president of Colombia stays would he maintain relationships neither to the leader nor to the Colombian government. 
"I cannot do this already alone because of my dignity", said Chávez which advances a constitutional reform the citizens of the Öllandes must vote in a referendum on on Sunday. 
With the reform he would improve his power considerably in the country. 
Trigger of the quarrel was the decision Uribes to withdraw the mandate from Chávez in Colombia for negotiations with Marxist rebels during which it was about the release of hostages. 
Uribe "has spat Venezuela with his decision into the face", Chávez had criticized on Sunday. 
Chávez is the talk of the town also in Spain. 
A new mobile telephone bell tone provides furore in the country: You don't think your mouth "Por qué no te callas" the sentence which people have already downloaded from the Internet more than half a million reads (why). 
Spain's King Juan Carlos has it spoken, which was irritated by the permanent interruptions of the on the left populist at the latest Iberoamerika peak and this had driven over the mouth.
