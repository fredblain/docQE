Fodor and the six Hungarian per cent 
As minister of the environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings come to an end on Tuesday and the debate about the international climate regime after 2012 is continued by the secretaries after the official opening on Wednesday. 
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss the schedule of Bali in which the issue reducing measures are fixed after 2012 expiry therefore after expiry of the Kyoto protocol for the time. 
At present, an intense debate is under way between industry and developing countries. 
They already have the USA signaled that they don't want to negotiate about concrete numbers, would be ready to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990 by 25-40 per cent to 2020, though. 
Whether the industrial nations are ready to support the developing countries besides the diminution of the issues both financially and technologically is the other great question of the meeting. 
An agreement on the support of developing countries was also obtained. 
This put the Kyoto protocol customization fund shall be managed by a 16-headed piece of advice most likely at the global Umweltfazilität (GEF) of UNO as has to be looked up "in the Piac és profit". 
Hungary six per cent 
Minister of the environment Gábor Fodor supports the endeavor in the name of Hungary keep the EU, its pioneering role at global climate protection measures and obtain a new international agreement to 2009. 
The secretary declared the EU will reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 20% to 2020 (measured against the values of 1990) independently of whether the "agreement after 2012" is obtained successfully or not. The union would be even ready to support a 30 per cent diminution other great industrial nations of the world or developing countries are also ready to meet their liabilities after strengths and responsible, soferne. 
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the target of the states which had joined the Kyoto protocol in 1997, a diminution from merely 5.2 per cent, was whereas, at that time, the EU had already itself committed 15 member states to doing a minus of 8% with hers. 
Diminution of the greenhouse gas emissions by 6% in comparison with the years 1985-87, a specification which will absolutely fulfill the country as the specification has to be looked up in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment, is for Hungary. 
Use is high in Bali -- after all, the long-dated international climate political agreement must be ready within two years, it would otherwise become effective certainly first after 2012. In this case no renewed, international emission reduction system would follow the diminution plans fixed in the Kyoto protocol, the meaning also has stressed the IPCC, the scientific climate change committee which is international and awarded the Nobel peace prize for UNO in its latest report. 
Through what would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences the consequence according to the Wissen's anuses the emission reduction would be delayed and the rise of the average temperature of the earth around more than 2° degrees Celsius would be inevitable.
