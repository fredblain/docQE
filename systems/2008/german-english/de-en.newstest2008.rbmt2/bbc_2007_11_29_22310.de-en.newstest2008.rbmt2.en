New fears about natural gas quarrel between Russia and the Ukraine 
A new price quarrel burns off slowly what the danger increases between the Ukraine and Russia that Russian exports of fuel are impaired to Western Europe. 
The largest portion of the Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) is conducted by the Ukraine and every quarrel between the two nations is watched very exactly. 
Kiew has warned, that if Moscow increases the price which it must pay for the natural gas, it will bill for higher transit charges of Russia. 
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU states. 
The latest quarrel between Kiew and Moscow happens at a time at which the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom try to achieve an agreement about it how much the Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in the year 2008. 
More must be charged to the Ukraine according to the Gazprom since the group has agreed to pay for natural gas up to 50% in addition from the neighboring Turkmenistan. 
Analysts say that this could mean, that 40% more must pay the Ukraine for the imports of Gazprom. 
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during conversations", told the Minister of Trade and Commerce to the Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters. 
"The natural gas prices changing should undoubtedly be connected with our arguments regarding the amount of the transit charges [to Western Europe] over the Ukraine." 
In the last great natural gas quarrel between Moscow and Kiew in January 2006 cut Gazprom deliveries to the Ukraine. 
This led into consequence to Western Europe what drastically pushed the prices in the height to a case of the exports. 
Russian gas agrees on a quarter of the supply for the European Union. 
Russia has the worldwide biggest gas deposits but much of this remains underdeveloped. 
It is the consequence that Gazprom completes its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other central Asian former Soviet nations.
