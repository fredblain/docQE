The motor vehicle insurance which covers a possible claim caused by the driver contains a high expense of age, sex, time of the preparation of the driver's license, marital status, type of the car to be insured and its use, among others whose height of re-rum of different factors takes off etc.. 
It is only the beginning to have a car. 
Because it is even more difficult to find the fitting motor vehicle insurance than the right vehicle model. 
At first once must be clear for one with which we have to do it here. 
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder. 
This agreement is in writing held tight by means of an insurance contract which fixes that the society gets the arranged insurance premium and is engaged in return to present the corresponding compensation sum at a claim. 
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance among others age, sex, time of the preparation of the driver's license, marital status, type of the vehicle to be insured or its use which gets together by several factors. 
The insurance enterprises fix their prices according to the statistics so that in case of a higher accident danger also larger payments of contribution get due. 
Having to for this reason both about 25-year and make women less payments of contribution because statistics prove that these groups show a lower accident rate thanks to their caution. 
The same also applies to married persons according to statement of the statistical values and therefore also after conviction the enterprise, too less accidents incline these, since as singles. 
The use which is attached to the vehicle impairs the frequency of the driving and thus also the probability of an accident. 
The more frequent the use, the more probable the damage. 
At the list of the bonus the insurances must take into account a whole number of points. 
For this reason the driver also must study the situation thoroughly to select exactly the car insurance which most likely approaches his personal needs. 
We list the most important points now in this place which one should draw at the choice of an insurance into respect to be not able to make only performance, but also a price oriented choice. 
Meet the less than 25-year-old numerous obstacles, such as the low driving experience and this one?young in the choice of a reasonably priced insurance? Driver's license. 
Even if it would be the best for an ideal insurance cover to effect a fully comprehensive insurance, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives. 
The careful drivers can select a fully comprehensive insurance with percentage excess so that the services of a fully comprehensive insurance are covered but offered at a low price. 
This kind of contract contains that the customer must pay a part of the amount arisen from the damage himself. 
The amount is?fixed before conclusion of the contract and using the amount of the insurance premium. This is more highly?, the lower the sum to be paid Luis Noguera, main representative of Spain at roof ridge Europe, explains to an arrangement enterprise for online insurances. 
Another option isn't, however, the extended insurance against the damages arisen at the car of one's own which insures the customer against external accident damages. 
In addition, this type of the insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss. 
Here one piece of advice. 
If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hand to lower the insurance costs; so your credit note increases by trying to drive carefully and to avoid accidents. 
A credit note is a reduction in the base rate at the appropriate insurance company. 
A punishing payment on the contrary contains an increase in a said rate to this. 
Yields take off the height of credit notes and punishing payments?of the society and this one. 
If the enterprise has a yield rich year behind itself, can permit himself to increase the bonus payments?, Noguera explains. 
As soon as the 25 annual brand is exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. Reason for it is the fact that with an increasing driving experience the accident rate drops. 
It therefore makes most sense to decide in favor of a fully comprehensive insurance with percentage excess. 
The teenagers usually cannot not profit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of the driving??, this one explains abbots of the European enterprise Spanish and adds that the majority of the accidents happens in the second practice year after these?fear of the beginner? you put down. 
It nevertheless is more advisable with a married customer who doesn't have any children to effect a fully comprehensive insurance; natural only then, if it also allows the financial situation of the corresponding person. 
Married couple is regarded as the customers on the part of the insurers with children with the lowest accident rate and its payments of contribution correspondingly also turn out low. 
In this case a fully comprehensive insurance would be the best option with percentage excess (at an amount by the 300 euros). One a high credit note has received, an extended insurance recommends this one only to the third vehicle year to itself in the case that shows commitment. 
Altogether, you drive?eased and have a greater spending power which permits it to them to attach a larger payment of contribution?, Luis Noguera states. 
Offers one's services for pensioners whom employs only at a sufficiently high credit note to effect a fully comprehensive insurance with percentage excess (at an amount by the 150 euros) or an extended insurance. 
One must hold tight at long last that it is the car insurance a little very important that a thorough choice is made which corresponds to our personal situation not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damages but also because it holds high costs which require it.
