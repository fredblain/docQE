The fathers of the cabbage skirt return 
Germany's super group of the seventies plays instruments again: The three ribbon members of Harmonia got to work on their consoles at a concert in Berlin once more. 
For the revival one seems recorded from her great time "live 1974". 
Even then they were fundamentally more famous abroad. 
The arranged sensation then happens at the evening panel in the form of three of sedate sirs. 
Everybody has his small box in front of himself, his cables and primarily his buttons. 
Dieter Moebius sits enthroned in the flower white shirt in the middle with 63 years. 
Links flanked of Michael Rother 57 years young and in the possession of laptop computer and guitar. 
Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends himself concentratedly at the console, looked from the lecture-hall on the right. 
From time to time, everybody even contributes noises beat, unite. 
And sometimes it makes inadvertently a conventional piece of music. 
This then doesn't seem to disturb the sirs greatly either itself. 
That the band Harmonia plays instruments again has under cabbage skirt enthusiasts for some excitement worried. 
In which one may reveal here: However, specific demands showed so lastingly not at all that although the name buzzed by the collective pop memory to miss this band for 32 years painfully. 
But why shall not the German be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies either? 
Particularly since what is misleadingly called cabbage skirt was always than in the country of one's own more valid in England and America. 
Group of Can 2003 awarded the echo prize for the life's work to the survivors of the inhabitants of Cologne, one saw in the hall into questioning German pop faces as the music economy. 
Himself talk Hot chilli pepper of Pepper as this one in the eulogy also with the bands La Düsseldorf and new! the astonishment didn't know any limits thanked you. 
At concerts Michael Rother squated at the talk Hot chilli pepper of Pepper on the stage like an old buddy later. 
Transfiguration is the one the problem of the ignorance in the foreign parts at home and this one. 
The memory is already therefore overtaxed with Harmonia because the trio existed for only two years and a far lower effect power than they were assigned to afterwards of other also developed at this time. 
Moebius and Roedelius had played instruments already before under the promising name cluster with the artist Conrad Schnitzler. 
At first one played in the cellar under the Berlin theater. 
After this in Düsseldorf for economic reasons for a record label maintained of the church. 
Rother had the at that time perhaps most radical German group, a reputation erspielt, helped out and following as a guitarist at new!, at power station briefly. 
Rother followed the cluster musicians at 1973 into the exile to forest in the Weser hilly scenery, though. 
They lived as town brief communards there in the old Weser court, a ruin from the 16th century. 
Less ideological than in the commune I, where Roedelius still was allowed to be troubled as a nanny. 
Rather in spitzweghaftem artist existence. 
Allegedly a pennant of the singing club also found itself Harmonia Ottenstein in the bulky refuse and for the art a name. 
Some held Harmonia of this tight. 
The first album was called "music of Harmonia" and the following "de luxe". 
Because the music so calmly and modestly also sounded, the band suffered a material need. 
The Reisigsammeln didn't serve alone the self finding. 
In front of an only just 50-headed record scenery, the CD "live 1974" appeared now was recorded for somebody thinks at a concert in Griessem like itself to remember. 
The desire to push Harmonia and to practice occasionally came from Rother at that time. 
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand. 
The band explained its separation in 1975. 
Rother landed in the esoteric spherical one and secured its existence for itself with albs like "fiery hearts". 
Cluster was revived in the eighties and is more successful than it was ever Harmonia since then. 
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer. 
It has aimed at the record firm Greenland, the cabbage skirt as a very own German contribution to cultivate music to the live one. 
New! did you already dig up like Roedelius solo plant? 
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world. 
Subsidized publicly in the context of the festival Woldtronics. 
Julian Cope is there, the brit, old punk and author of the manual "cabbage skirt sampler". 
The Loveparade inventor is also Dr. Motte there. 
With what the complete frequency range of the influences of the cabbage skirt on the following pop music would be outlined. 
The blank of the super group is filled out by Harmonia. 
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most peculiar Sounds in the hall: "Music only keeps, these the future belongs to her." 
There are pictures which show the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse parlor. 
Projections of additional black-and-white photos of confusedly cabled equipment serve the putting formation. 
In front of that the three veterans are occupied with the improvisation again. 
Not eliciting outrageous tones from instruments around which over effect equipment built any more by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums. 
The electronic music looks like electronic music today. 
Tinkerer deepened three into the technical one. 
To this the choir of the house also changes nothing. 
The line Barbara Morgensterns is coughed and whispered under Soundwolken and sung in a beautiful place with emphasis under. 
Cabbage skirt was always a very English concept. 
It never was skirt. 
The roots were looked for less than in colleges of music (Can), technologies (power station) or on the flight with artistic and social conventions (clusters) in the blues. 
Who here 68 calls, not quite is wrong and Harmonia cannot be brought by it now either from the quiet. 
The most natural is reconsidered thoroughly on the stage. 
Where does music begin and when does she stop? 
This can rob one of the nerves or grant brief moments of great happiness.
