Simply isn't Richard Gere cynically enough 
"The Hunting party" and "dreadful peace" deal with two films with the Balkankrieg again. 
But both don't convince. 
The concepts put too much on action and Geballer or else they are too touching either. 
Richard Gere cannot help in "The Hunting party" there either. 
The good news first: The war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans but the actors' Richard Gere has been found again now there in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnia war of all things. 
We had lost the most beautiful man of the eighties from the eyes last because too many nice inconsequential roles cured one of the inclination for looking in well feeling films for women and too many press conferences to the Buddhism topic. 
Richard is suddenly javelins the most important argument, himself, The Hunting party " -- if the hunter becomes the chased " now why look?) perhaps anyway, today, film titles must always be so long and confused actually like train driver wage agreements. 
He delivers a wonderfully winking representation: His war reporter Simon Hunt is, taken in the reason this what would have been able to be from javelin if destiny and the film industry were not so merciful: Decline has still a man his who has his very best times behind himself for a long time kept considerable remains of the former charm this one but himself as a monument identical in ruin. 
But despite this trump "The Hunting party" together with the German production, "dreadful peace", which also starts this week continues only the endless row of failed Balkankriegs films. 
"Dreadful peace" can with one put on a short trial: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian from kosovarischen snipers, on whom the one promptly also falls in love with them. 
Although it is welcome that, once, the Serbians aren't represented as an only root of all evil here, the television flat film loses itself fast too in Geballer and action. 
However, it remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without freeway for this with war. 
On the other hand, can be investigated virtually exemplarily to "The Hunting party" why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie actually. 
Perhaps a new "Apocalypse Now" could have become the story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to "the fox" track down the Serbian top war criminal with another director and a different one scriptwriter (both into personal union Richard Shepard) at another time. 
Because the Storys are alike frappierend: Small teams don't go what the armed forces both times to the woods it becomes a journey into the insanity be able to to accomplish something and both times. 
One is one of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting party" that Simon Hunt doesn't simply let the shabby cynic as whom he is introduced to us at the beginning be with heart. 
A romantic affair with a Muslim Bosnian andichten murdered later must still no the script for it on top of everything. 
Definitely, "The Hunting party" goes the creek down then if the reporters succeed in the time-lapse photography method within the last five minutes which Nato, CIA and all headhunters of the world haven't made within five years: Catching the war criminal and leaving to the Muslim Bosnians for the just revenge. 
This is so bad that one would like to call the international court of justice in The Hague against the cinema logic because of crimes. 
The film has a deeply human request. 
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still run around freely and he doesn't suspect the Americans and the Frenchmen (here shall they agree for once) to do the following due to secret political arrangements too intensively. 
But are so similarly the thought well and the bad one sometimes that a famous Brecht poem comes one into the meaning. 
It is called in it over the wood mask of an Asian demon on the work-table of the poet: "I sympathetically see the swollen veins in the temple, indicating: how exhausting it is to be bad ". 
Films like "The Hunting party" have exactly such swelling heads which, however, indicate how exhausting, well to be, it is. 
The problem isn't limited on the genre of the Balkankriegsfilms. 
Recently is in this newspaper reports got, that all Iraq films of Hollywood were large flops. 
One can add: There has never been a good South Africa film, too. 
Be almost always valid: If a starling knocks around on the flash points or minefields of the world, then something like that comes out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "hereafter of all limits", with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio. 
All the conflicts are possibly from the point of view of time simply still too near. 
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood with "Schindler's list" could shoot a good film about the holocaust. 
Many a film still will well mature, the Vietnam plants "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" being regarded as a classic now or "Full Metal jacket" has unanimously at that time yes not at all been celebrated as masterpieces. 
But perhaps we know, where on the same two screens today every mass murder in real time amounts at home, also simple too much about the conflicts of the world. 
And this robs the film script authors of the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs to tell good stories. 
Yes, his or nonexistence has therefore got so good, after all, because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know yet how badly there was really the Nazi regime " " or "the great dictator", too. 
Perhaps one mustn't want to be good if one wants to make good films. 
Perhaps one must have the sarcastically distant artist look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk. 
When this one was questioned to parallels between his historical novel "Lempri√®res dictionary" and the Balkankrieg, he answered: "This only lies that some things never change. 
Cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and war always will be in Yugoslavia."
