<p>
<seg id="2"> Heuer have been more than a thousand infections recorded in hospitals, which were caused to the improper use of antibiotics.  </seg>
<seg id="3"> The health conditions of the hospitals, the Überbelegung of the beds, the congestion of the staff, all factors, the the Eindämmen the infections not just good are, as the senior doctor of National Epidemiologiezentrums.  </seg>
<seg id="4"> In many areas will also in the Desinfektionsmitteln saved.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Traumatologie-Abteilung the János hospital was so long ago a MRSA-Infektion diagnosed.  </seg>
<seg id="6"> The against antibiotics resistente Bakterium was found in a male patient, who has been provided in hospital in a serious accident.  </seg>
<seg id="7"> The patient has been isolated.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The beginning of the year, it is already a similar infection.  </seg>
<seg id="9"> The injured a serious Autounfalls was released from the hospital, less than later had the man but not with a MRSA-Infektion return. A major operation, since for the Bakteriums, the is still in the body of the patients is, however, have not implemented.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> So far 10 December of the year were from hospitals 1094 by multiresistente agent has infections to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance system reported, however, as the senior doctor the National Epidemiologiezentrums, Karolina Böröcz.  </seg>
<seg id="11"> For many people, by multiresistente agent has infections were registered in the hospitals in other words with security, the unreported, but be higher.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> About two thirds of the infections, 683 cases draft it were the MRSA, the against Methicillin-Oxacillin resistenten Staphylococcus aureus caused.  </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Staphylococcus aureus, SA draft it Bakterium is about a third of the people in their hearts, but not that it cause a disease would.  </seg>
<seg id="14"> SA-bedingte infections, as more or less Halsentzündung, Mandelentzündung, Entzündungen of the skin or wounds draft it respond more often well to antibiotics, they are well curable.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Will the money but not too high dosiert or unsachgemäß applied, may arise from the well respondierenden away Antibiotika-resistente, which is under appropriate conditions in the hospitals quickly spread.  </seg>
<seg id="16"> In particular in patients with geschwächtem, or the long term a bad thing funktionierendem Immunsystem, and in older, or patients with small Körpergewicht can this away serious infections, example Wundinfektion or Blutvergiftung, other words Sepsis, cause.  </seg>

<p>
<seg id="23"> The majority of by MRSA caused infections in hospitals would be avoided, but that the currently prevailing conditions and circumstances good for the control of the creation or the spread of multiresistenten Erregers, however, say Karolina Böröcz.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> After the infection mainly in hospitals and Altersheimen do, however, should the Spitäler the eingelieferten patients into consideration and MRSA-infizierte immediately isolate.  </seg>
<seg id="25"> In the Hungarian hospitals will the microbiological authorisation but not too many into practice.  </seg>
<seg id="26"> Last, but not least because it from the state Krankenkasse no support for this investigation is.  </seg>

<p>
<seg id="28"> The of the European Union is it strict recommendations on this matter use of antibiotics in the medicine, it is and in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and Krankheitsbilder.  </seg>
<seg id="29"> Antibiotika-Therapien should must be, that is, however, microbiological studies are necessary, it is no Resistenz against the resources which can, but will this directive of hospitals also not always complied with.  </seg>
<seg id="30"> In the ambulanten, or are in the care and patients are microbiological handling Probenentnahmen even more rare, however, it Karolina Böröcz.  </seg>

<seg id="33"> For that reason is the Händewaschen, or the role of Handschuhen and Masken a great importance to, but is it also in this area a great deal shortcomings in the hospitals.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> MRSA is by Tröpfcheninfektion or a daily basis and, in the future hospitals is but not always the possibility, to isolate the infected patients.  </seg>
<seg id="35"> The room is even often overloaded, the beds only each other gereiht, although it should be a gap of at least 1.5 meters between them from epidemiological perspective.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> As Karolina Böröcz further points out, is it unfortunately in the financial much less good and hospitals even before, that in Desinfektionsmitteln saved will, it is only a few Pfleger, many patients, all factors, the the source of infection is they.  </seg>
</p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The believe the department for a risk analysis, Risk Analysing division draft it of political Capital have the activities of in this August with support the ' movement for a better Hungary which up Ungarischen guard the risk Hungary and the region in many ways increased.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In ' Risikowarnungs-Bericht \" the Institute is it among other things, In this context with the activities the Ungarischen guard is the highest political risk the \" stepped up the existing ethnic tensions between the home and Nicht-Zigeunerbevölkerung in Hungary in Parliament, the even the short term to violent ethnic clashes lead could out.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Reason for this is the strategy the Ungarischen guard, which I believe to the provocation of this conflict which, as the Committee.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the meantime, will be seen as a failure from the political leaders ' people of the public life have the debate the Roma-Frage representatives radical political groups to it, the now their political strategy to the Roma-Ungarn-Gegensatz set up have out.  </seg>
<seg id="6"> It is, however, that this the problem worse, the reasonable dialogue impossible to make, Extremitäten they, as well as the likely violent clashes increase would.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Forschungsinsitut believes ausserdem, the activities of the Union Ungarischen guard would, however, not least thanks the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, ' the image Hungary in the world much damage, especially what the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity is out.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> We know we, For autumn 2006 is the reorganisation of radical and very good groups in Hungary a daily basis in the recovery, and for summer 2007. several, is ' national Selbstverteidigungsverein which nennende organisations established were.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Of These groups is common, however, that it will be a civil organisation definition, and it open to boast, its members to, sometimes armed, really prepare for disasters, defence, Ordnungshütung draft it, in an appeal to the particularly the police, the army, or the State itself out, said it.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> And continue. All this is under the method, which an attempt, different, to the policies and Parteiverdrossenheit of the population based, political aspirations and Civil initiative to sweeping.  </seg>
<seg id="11"> The emphasis of the civilian character and the Vereinsform which is not just the people of legal hurdles, which could appear in court within the framework of the registration, it is also a political strategy.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> As to was the analysis is, however, are the activities of Ungarischen guard a risikoerhöhenden factor also for the relations with the countries which.  </seg>
<seg id="13"> \" In the last few months was the Ungarische guards in several countries as potential source she said, so some ultranationalistischer politicians certain neighbouring countries is in the creation of Ungarischen guard the confirmation its own Anti-Ungarn-Politik.  </seg>
<seg id="14"> All this has repercussions on the political stability of the region \", said it.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In the view of the institute is the set up the Ungarischen guard not Einzelphänomen in Zentral-Ost-Europa, therefore is the political risk for the whole region has increased.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the meantime, however, are the activities the Ungarischen guard with the Bulgarischen Nationalgarde a par, which was founded in August 2007 of rechtsextremen Bulgarischen National the European Union, BNU draft it announced was.  </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the background of the creation of the Bulgarian guards were the Roma-Massenausschreitungen, the in a urban areas of Sofia, Krasna Poljana draft it been have.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BNU has the events at the an opportunity to set up the Nationalgarde taken, with the argument, that the objective of the organisation the ' national protection which is.  </seg>
<seg id="19"> Your opinion has been other words in the last 17 years a real ' Zigeunerterror out in Bulgaria. , the government was, however, stand and indifferent, as political Capital.  </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition to, The initiative was a heated debate in the Bulgarian public losgetreten.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also by the fact been verified, that some Bulgarian Roma-Organisationen announced have, to Widerstandszwecken their own guards to create.  </seg>
<seg id="22"> As the activities of Ungarischen guard so far too many similarities with those the Bulgarischen Nationalgarde is, is it not be excluded, that the Hungarian gypsies also, with the Organisieren their own protection on the threats act, is it in Risikowarnungsbericht of political Capital.  </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Hvg.hu, The new Hit raises the question to, What is our music reserved for a certain class?  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Balázs Zságer: the term ' Schichtmusik which means I do not just a great deal.  </seg>
<seg id="25"> In my opinion is it two corporate in the Popmusik, and am not mainstream and Underground, or An alternative and the Third International Mathematics, but Kommerziell and honest.  </seg>
<seg id="26"> Even the so-called Alternativ- or Underground-Musik can seicht and enough be, however, as the way they and only for produced the sale will, the it to commercial music is.  </seg>
<seg id="27"> The a good Pop-Nummer can be created from the original reason.  </seg>
<seg id="28"> The realise the Hörers work but also for this principle, of languages and borders independent.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Hvg.hu: Siehst you a difference in the public access the Hungarian and the foreign public your music with regard?  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Example Zs. : In other countries, particularly west of us has the Popmusik a longer tradition behind it.  </seg>
<seg id="31"> In fact, not only teenagers or Twens to Konzerte, but also the elderly people.  </seg>
<seg id="32"> You follow the trends in the Popmusik, the about it was done, a great deal closely, because they they also to some of the contemporary culture time.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Hvg.hu: What kind of role is the public to in your work?  </seg>
<seg id="34"> Is it important, who, where and how many hear your music?  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Example Zs. , Of course is it a good feeling, to do so, that more and more to our Konzerten come.  </seg>
<seg id="36"> We have but not in favour of the market komponiert.  </seg>
<seg id="37"> The us is the music not, in order to serve a purpose, but for any particular reason.  </seg>
<seg id="38"> The role of the public is the most part in the Konzerten a, where it is already a mutual interaction, but the is it is only in the ungreifbaren changes the ongoing.  </seg>
<seg id="39"> In spite of this is me one note: Willst du it all right to make, are you are not interesting.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Hvg.hu: How far möchtest you the example of Yonderboi the same?  </seg>
<seg id="41"> It is rather than Solist on and has his career more in the West set up.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Example Zs. , We are not really its own way, sometimes it very well, that we are once again an attempt, this in our music hineinzuinterpretieren.  </seg>
<seg id="43"> We can see us more than Teamplayer, the to the musikalische presence of the other trust and they play it on.  </seg>
<seg id="44"> At were of course comparisons of our work with the of Yonderboi lead, when a number of us from its production are and have taken a different way.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Hvg.hu: In the Charts of mr2 Petőfi is the word ' Wings of Love which at centre stage.  </seg>
<seg id="46"> Many people have only in connection with this number the name Zagar is.  </seg>
<seg id="47"> Was the opening up with a something populäreren more in the right direction of a broader public aware orchestrated?  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> Example Zs. , We have had no plans, a Hit to write, the then as Zugpferd for the Album an excuse to do so.  </seg>
<seg id="49"> In this song is it to do anymore.  </seg>
<seg id="50"> It was a final the Albums was intended, with the we the Klangorgie and the more difficult issues itself would like to.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Hvg.hu: In what way are you the six Sängerinnen selected?  </seg>
<seg id="52"> Why is it, which has been the guidance.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> Example Zs. , The idea was, however, a Gospel-artigen chorus to make.  </seg>
<seg id="54"> If so, the idea, the chorus from talented Solisten the future Musikszene after all.  </seg>
<seg id="55"> For example is the sechsköpfige chorus has been closed, other words Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi -LSB-Neo-RSB-, Juci Németh, , the we then apäter a so-called ' Underground Divas which christened have.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> Hvg.hu: Wolltest you the song as we have seen, or have it the girls mitgestaltet?  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> Example Zs. , The number was it a long time in the Instrumentalversion, but rather than the material on this Album ready has been, thought we us, that this number be ' something needs '.  </seg>
<seg id="58"> The Akkordenabfolge has formally to a Gesangsstimme calling for.  </seg>
<seg id="59"> I have the tune the same time in the same night eingesungen, later have they learned the girls.  </seg>
<seg id="60"> It, all practical purposes to straightaway and very spontaneous.  </seg>
<seg id="61"> I can remember, I was at that time a elektrisiert, but it has already also the ' Divas ' taken place.  </seg>
<seg id="62"> In my voice is would the song has become never so great.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Hvg.hu, The to the don, as well as the chorus was we but the impression, the girls would be in The background.  </seg>
<seg id="64"> It is not Solo-Part, said the short Solo of Judy Jay draft it, they have no own role, sings perfect and and are not all, however, as the music, is will it Gesang of the music not only with.  </seg>
<seg id="65"> In addition to the stage were it back.  </seg>
<seg id="66"> Is it will.  </seg>

<seg id="68"> We do so we them aware not Solo-Rollen to happen here.  </seg>
<seg id="69"> In the number is it also a question, that we be ego a bit the fact is, however, who where has and where agriculture is concerned, let us simply to, that we this particular side, the side of the love emporheben.  </seg>
<seg id="70"> I would like, however, that also other this euphorischen state feel, the we felt have, and the song came is.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> Hvg.hu: What has been the aufwendigste know?  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> Example Zs. , In the musical Schaffensarbeit in fact do not, however, it has more the Mixen difficult tasks there.  </seg>
<seg id="73"> For example in the word ' Dorian Gray's dilemma \", in which I to a Konzertklavier source, or in \" Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls ', where the Groove longer will not work was going to say, but gradually has is all unite, as in a puzzle.  </seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> The insurance companies set their own prices in the statistics say, and in a higher risk also higher contributions earlier will.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> For this reason we should have both on 25-Jährige and women make more contributions, as statistics show, however, that these groups with their caution a lower Unfallquote to.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The same applies also to married people, because this according to the statistical values and therefore also to that of the companies, to less accidents tend as Alleinstehende.  </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> With regard to the establishment of the premium must the insurance a number of points into account.  </seg>
<seg id="15"> For this reason must also the drivers the situation very carefully study, in order exactly what the Autoversicherung environment, the his personal needs best response.  </seg>
<seg id="16"> We listen to this point now the most important points to, which we should take into account in terms of selecting a insurance, in order not only a strong, but also a preisorientierte election taken to can.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The in 11% taken in the election of a cheap insurance in a number of obstacles, as for example the small Fahrpraxis and the junge specific.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Even if it for a perfect insurance the best would be, a Vollkaskoversicherung a successful conclusion, is it still cheaper alternatives.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The cautious drivers can the one hand Vollkasko with Selbstbeteiligung choose, and the services a Vollkaskoversicherung is covered, but at a low price offer will.  </seg>
<seg id="20"> This type of Treaty is, however, that the consumer must pay some of the amount created by the damage himself.  </seg>

<seg id="21"> Der amount will in a successful conclusion of the Treaty and on the total amount of Versicherungsprämie established. This is higher the lower the to bezahlende Summe, said Luis Noguera, Council Spain in First Europe, a Vermittlungsunternehmen for Online-Versicherungen.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Another option is the more extensive insurance, the the customers against external Unfallschäden assured us of this, but not against the on their own car has been created damage.  </seg>
<seg id="23"> In addition would this type of insurance theft, fire and Fahrzeugverlust cover.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The a Council.  </seg>
<seg id="25"> If you are old in 25 years, is it in your hand, the insurance costs to a very low level, it increased to accept Gutschrift, by you versuchst, careful to travel and accidents can be prevented.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> A Gutschrift is a reduction of five in the this matter Versicherungsgesellschaft.  </seg>
<seg id="27"> On the contrary to is a Strafzahlung a question tariff increase.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Die how high credits and Strafzahlungen are of the society and its return from.  </seg>
<seg id="29"> If the company a ertragsreiches year behind it has, however, can it is possible, the Bonus-Zahlungen to erhöhen, set out Noguera.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Once the 25-Jahre-Marke goes beyond that is, is it for the drivers simple a Treaty completed. The reason for this is the fact, however, that with increased Fahrpraxis the Unfallquote falling.  </seg>
<seg id="31"> This is it the sinnvollsten, are in favour of a Vollkaskoversicherung with Selbstbeteiligung to decide.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Normalerweise can the young people will not benefit from their previous experience from, both in the event of an accident as well as the timing of Fahrens nicht, set out the Spanish Vorsteher the European company, and adds a further point, that the majority of the accidents is in second Praxisjahr happen, after the Angst the Anfängers question was.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> In spite of this is it in a married customers, who has no children, ratsamer, a Vollkaskoversicherung complete, of course be, if it the financial situation the appropriate person also allows.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The the companies as well as couples with children and the customers with the lowest Unfallquote, and therefore low are also their contributions from.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> In this case would be a Vollkaskoversicherung with Selbstbeteiligung, in a amount to the 300 available draft it the best option. In case that we a high Gutschrift they has, , is a more extensive insurance, the only the third Fahrzeugjahr place.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Sie driving as a whole entspannter and have a greater purchasing power, the it them the floor, a greater contribution anzusetzen, is Luis Noguera said.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> For retired people is it is to, a Vollkaskoversicherung with Selbstbeteiligung, in a amount to the 150 euro draft it, or a wider insurance a successful conclusion, the only in a sufficiently high Gutschrift place.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> In must be quite clear, however, that the Autoversicherung something very important is, not only, because it the drivers against possible Unfallschäden protect, and, because it high costs is, which it must, however, that a fundamental choice made will, which is our personal situation.  </seg>

<seg id="6"> The two months ago the Prime Minister is the call for a choice they had, to dämliche one way or another the intelligence of the British offensive, by it had, that opinion polls this decision not on have, was it hope, that it would provide a robust, effective government.  </seg>
<seg id="7"> Instead of which, as Vince Cable, the in ever greater extent clever Vertretungsvorsitzende the Liberal Democrats, said it, has is the einstmals feared Brown of Stalin to had. Bean developed.  </seg>
<seg id="8"> The heavy-handed measures of Northern implementing, a folding bank, however, was regulatorische weakness and poor judgment in attack.  </seg>
<seg id="9"> When reasonable proposals for change of the taxes have Unternehmensverbände found against the government.  </seg>
<seg id="10"> The steuerbehördliche loss of personal data of 25 million people was inconceivable administrative Pfuschereien taken into account.  </seg>
<seg id="11"> A trio of generals in retirement launched a rebellion in the Lords in protest against cuts of military, Minister of the forces to be, I thought it, is a Teilzeitjob.  </seg>
<seg id="12"> Now is it the many donations of David Abrahams, Mr watts, Labours General Secretary, and her former Erfüllungsleiter draft it is already resigned.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The fact is, however, that Brown no direction Abtritt aufbricht.  </seg>
<seg id="14"> We can governments a turning point achieve, under which they it impossible have to government.  </seg>
<seg id="15"> There are still rely on people politicians, but believe they do their scepticism go back, if a new force taking the office.  </seg>
<seg id="16"> If it even clear is, that it unlikely is, however, that a Prime Minister improve the situation, and it is still not even a long time in to, is this delay over: the public service begins leaking to be, the Kabinettsminister start to plaudern, the press seeking to bad news, and the government is defensive and ziellos.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In a way is the position of Brown particularly difficult, because it on the other hand to other political leaders not say is concerned, a new Besen to.  </seg>
<seg id="18"> The more than he denied Tony Blair would, was it be Oberleutnant.  </seg>
<seg id="19"> The problems with Northern implementing and the Steuerzuständigkeitsunterlagen, for example, are together with decisions, was the Brown as a Chancellor of the Finance.  </seg>
<seg id="20"> And even if the not directly involved has been in Blair Missgeschicke, as in the long ' money for Adelstitel which TIMSS of political party financing, are the electorate may be in place, that he it was.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In spite of that is Browns situation quite so bad, as it is </seg>
<seg id="22"> The deficiencies are no longer so terrible, as the Conservatives describe it.  </seg>
<seg id="23"> As in had. Bean, no one is dead, or was completely beschwindelt.  </seg>
<seg id="24"> And the your solutions, difficult as it may be, is deliver, and Browns of course stalinistische trends and promised have: A reliable, sound and easily brutal government.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The new behaviour for political donations is a very good example.  </seg>
<seg id="26"> The garboeske Abrahams, the the country's donations with his non-governmental talents compared, said he would not public recognition to be good.  </seg>
<seg id="27"> This is perhaps it be, but the decision on this was him not to.  </seg>
<seg id="28"> The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are quite clear and they are in a clear reason, the public has a right to know to know, who have access to those buy can, which the Member States government.  </seg>
<seg id="29"> Watts, the say it would of Abrahams agreement find out, but not, however, that it is illegal, will are of course some questions face, just as Jon Mendlesohn, Labours Hauptfinanzeintreiber, the on the extraordinary donations in October told was.  </seg>
<seg id="30"> But so far is Brown not involved, It is not, however, that to there, that it of this confusion once again, although the majority of the payment was made in June after his office.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> It has the Prime the part of the work done.  </seg>
<seg id="32"> He has quickly the violation of the law by his party condemned, but he verwässerte this decision by the very to a well known instrument, a inquiry on the issue, which, in order to fully make the level, of a Bishop in retirement and a judge.  </seg>
<seg id="33"> In this case are the ' it to ziehenden lessons which do not very complicated.  </seg>
<seg id="34"> If the law has been broken, is it a matter for the police.  </seg>
<seg id="35"> In fact is it other things which Mr Brown to make must, as a a permanent chairman of the independent Committee for standards in public life to the European Union, the unfilled for six months is, and move forward with a radical reform of political parties.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> That would of the hard-liners of the Labour require with the Conservatives to cooperate and perhaps the very close financial relationship with the unions give up, bitter pills for a party as Mr Brown.  </seg>
<seg id="37"> But it should be some having a clear on one thing.  </seg>
<seg id="38"> The Conservatives have now a very strong lead in the opinion polls, he has two years to voters back, and the only way, as it a victory achieve can, is by undisputed strongly and solid enough power.  </seg>

<seg id="1"> England faced with the decision taken on the comments of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The two dilemmas, each one it almost as difficult as the other.  </seg>
<seg id="3"> Who is a number 6 for the United Kingdom in Kandy in this weekend, , Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?  </seg>
<seg id="4"> In addition, no less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second question is important, because David Graveney, the Wahlvorsitzende, to call at least in this particular title, this is, in order the Cheftrainer Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan in to help them to decide, and that is the table of High Morries, the English executive director, starting with candidates for the Member States ' Wählerämter really, if not even for the in Teilzeit.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Who also are not the sixth Schlägerposition about it, will be unfortunate, but the life is often unfair and the sport is it no doubt.  </seg>
<seg id="7"> It is never easy, clearly marked, what a human being made possible the top its Berufszweiges to achieve, in any case not on the lowest level succeeding, some cases from lack of success rather than ability.  </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is not only in Kricket, where the selection difficult is, where decisions necessary is concerned, which are always subjective at the end.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Is it the right time for Bopara full standing?  </seg>
<seg id="10"> Is it fair to Shah if it is it?  </seg>
<seg id="11"> The same can probably also in a further area this will, however, whether for example John Edwards or ' Tubby which Banerjee, both intelligent young leaders with good qualifications, the the business well know, promoted will should.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Who can say, what the right class to a Kricketspieler is concerned, it is the fact, it is an opportunity, to be prepared and remain.  </seg>
<seg id="13"> Of course have figures a major influence on decisions, but we have this also.  </seg>
<seg id="14"> The a team must a Kricketspieler the eye of the captain for the right time are, if it a Wicket take can and a thugs must regular opportunities on the order received, if it as a eintägiger Kricketspieler impression to us would like to see.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The eyes of Auswähler to catch is more complicated.  </seg>
<seg id="16"> It was a great deal, which in the last season more effectively than, for example, and James Anderson were, the play in the first test apparently will, even if Stephen Harmison themselves for healthy said and as the winds in the networks kegelt.  </seg>
<seg id="17"> Anderson, 32 first-class Wickets with the 33 Runs, in order to earn a position in this Tour.  </seg>
<seg id="18"> Chris Tremlett, only 29 with the same modest average, but they have had their Glanzpunkte and hope to more than that.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Whether or not Shah or Bopara in Asgiriya stage is, can only a Ansichtsfrage be.  </seg>
<seg id="20"> The election could the Karrieren decide both men, and it is perhaps but very little difference.  </seg>
<seg id="21"> Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty in every test and has been successful in first, with five Wickets and 40 useful Runs, it was, however, Paul Collingwood, was still kämpfend in order to consolidate itself, the the breakthrough to a very serious Testkricketspieler concerned and the, although it a double hundred against Australia in Australia punktete, perhaps still underestimated will.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> It is, however, that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, to a further discussion as the today's Netzsitzung in Asgiriya stage their Conservative instincts and Bauchgefühl for Shahs greater experience on Boparas young enthusiasm the same will.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> There are arguments for both.  </seg>
<seg id="24"> The Shah is the country's funkelnden and very important 88 Test-Debüt-Innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, the seven years with 22 years younger is, and a good record against angedrehtes bullets.  </seg>
<seg id="25"> But Shah was only 10 Runs in his two Innings in May against West Indies in the test at Lord, his or her Heimatarena as a players from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the Auswählern and Vaughan healthy was, in order its position for the next game back, think the momentum from his Would taken to have, the are still in Bombay has been.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand to has the Alleskönner from Essex schaufelweise Lebensfreude.  </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is of no benefit to a Kricketplatz impressed and its position outside of it was on the point been made, and he recently a vehicle with Vierradantrieb in a issue for England sponsor Volkswagen in rapid succession, . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> It erlitt minor injuries and I believe a shock, but the first, what he did, however, was be Vodafone, of course also gesponsort draft it so and his Teamkollegen Alastair Cook to, the this from afar, had, and with enthusiasm to say: ' Have you the seen? '.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Bopara is a much better Feldspieler, however, he kegelt be Mitteltempo with some effect here on the Spielfeldern, which seems to fit to it and forward with confidence and skill.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> To choose The right man is one thing, however, to choose the right time another.  </seg>
<seg id="31"> Perhaps this is the real art of the choice.  </seg>
<seg id="32"> I tend to Bopara now its opportunity to give, what does not mean, however, that Shah would not but well off will, if, as the Teesatz from Ceylon People, he who is, the here this weekend play will.  </seg>
