<seg id="1"> Food guilty at European inflation</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The food prices in a fast way increasing are main reason for the rise of the inflation measured in the euro zone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the 13 countries of the euro zone the price increase was in November higher than expects - after that 2.6 percent in October was registered an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent, reported as the Statistical Office the EU in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Official predictions took only 3 percent as a basis,Bloomberg announced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Unlike the American, British, and Canadian issuing bank the European central bank (EZB) did not lower the Leitzsins. According to your discretion the increasing raw material prices and the easy drop of the unemployment would favor the origin of an inflationary spiral the reduction of the rate of interest.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The EZB is eager to hold the inflation rate under two percent, or at least just at the two Percent-brand.</seg>
<seg id="7"> According to an analyst the EZB is in the fix: One must "arrange" the inflation in order to exclude later action need.</seg>
<seg id="8"> With 3,3 percent the inflation rate in November in Germany reached a twelve Year record high; in Spain the rate climbed from 3,6 on 4,1 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The climbed food and energy prices are responsible for the rise of the inflation in the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The MATIF wheat notations climbed around 88 percent, and the course in soybeans reached also a record high since 1973.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Also with edible oil and milk products there was aconsiderable price increase in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The world market price for crude oil increased this year around 52 percent - in the last month the price reached dollar to almost 100 US per barrel of the black gold.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> According to the EZB the inflation will climb in the year 2008 from 2,1 on 2,5 percent, however, one counts in 2009 with a drop on 1,9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14"> For the coming 3-4 months analysts take a 3-percent inflation rate as a basis, number the annual average rate, however, with 2,1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="15"> For 2008 experts reckon that the EZB will decrease the intereststwice.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Gallup locates government crisis</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> After long stagnating the number of the Fidesz-sympathizers grew until beginning of December considerably. First times since 2002 the party has the biggest base warehouse while the approval was reaching a never yet been low of 13 percent for the socialists according to Gallup.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> With the party-loyal voters the difference turns out thanks to the high determination of the opposition proponents clearly: More than two thirds (71 percent) stand a fifth (20 percent) opposite approval for the MSZP.</seg>
<seg id="4"> MDF and SZDSZ lie according to inquiry under the parliamentary entrance hurdle: You come in the total population to two percent.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The number of the party voters grew in bothwarehouses around a percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In the comparison to the last low the general economical atmosphere kept on worsening - never before yet the part of those that judge the economic position of the country "badly" as being "expressed" was not so high (41 percent) while further 46 percent of them are holding for "quite bad".</seg>
<seg id="7"> According to more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer the families see the change of their financial situation once again more pessimistic.</seg>
<seg id="8"> For the coming year the majority of the population reckons a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth goes out of an improvement.</seg>
<seg id="9"> A Gallup-inquiry carried out in December showed that 71 % of the interviewees - a historical high - "judged" the work of the prime minister as bad "rather than right".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Thirteen percent of the interviewees have great confidence or confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány while the part of the proponents is forming 38 percent for Viktor Orbán.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In about 54 % do not trust the head of the government at all, compared with 27 % of distrust of the party leader of the Fidesz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> One of the indicators of the political atmosphere is the number of those, mine, one could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister also without government changes into the grip.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Had themselves to the riots in last October still expressed 35 % for the whereabouts of the government and the head of the government, this part amounts today only to another 20 % while the relative majority (33 percent) is seeing the solution only in new choices.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Asked for their interest at the plebiscite answered 60 percent, that they participate "with security", and would give further 20 % their vote "probable".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> For the comparison: if the parliament choices occurred on this Sunday, only 55 percent "with security" would go to the urns, further 15 % hold their participation for "probable". Faced with these tendencies the result of the plebiscite would be forseeable.</seg>
<seg id="16"> 74 % would become against the tuition fees, 79 % against the practice fee, and 84 % against the hospital day money make.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Moved onto the group that at the plebiscite "with security" The parts of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would become to participating even 81, 84, and/or 89 percent are.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Hypermarkets in the Budaoerser commercial field retained also this year the average increase in prices of 16 % of the last year, with the difference that there was not any rise of the value added tax this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Article from Napi Gazdaság</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In the Budaoerser commercial triangle the "Napi" increased around 16 percent the price of the usual Christmas basket also this year, however in all hypermarkets increases in prices of more than 1.000 HOOF were registered.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After the prices "galloped off" in the food markets in last December, the price increase did not turn out prozentuell drastically, compared with the anyhow high, former initial level.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However works determined it onto the consumers quenching, that which they had paid HUF for in the last year still far under 9.000 of this year even for 10.000 is available TO HUF.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The price of the "Napi" Market basket crossed the magic one 10. 000-HOOVES-HUF Borders around at least 91 in the examined markets.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The highest price was 10.573 HOOF.</seg>
<seg id="9"> (In 6800 the price suited TO HUF at 6.800.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The prices for Unicum and live fish almost remained on previous year level, strong on the other hand the prices for turkey hen breast fillets, nut and poppy have climbed.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungarians, at Auchan there was 1 kg bread loaf, however, for 139 forint.</seg>
<seg id="12"> It did not give up with the product any collapse ofprices due to competition less than 200 forint.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Also the price of one was surprising here two liters of Coca-Cola returnable bottle of less than 200 forint, thus the drink cost HUF including pledge only in 257.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless Auchan at the most expensive, and Cora at the most favorable cut off this year in the "Napi" Market basket comparison.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Our calculations made, that Cora the prices in the "Napi" Market basket opposite the Christmas prices in the last year at 15, while Tesco and Auchan were increasing each about 18 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the heurigen year was 12 %, during the rise between cheapest market basket of the last year and formed most expensive the current year's 21 %.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The average price climb was 1.480,00 HOOF.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The average increase in prices was still enclosed in the previous year 1.206,00 forint, however, the value added tax increase became noticeable with the prices of too last Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Exactly this process found the trade badly: Seemingly the department stores could not decide so right which price margin they are supposed to use with the single articles since the effects of the increase in prices on the consumer behavior were unpredictable.</seg>
<seg id="20"> (If the trader plans the rotation speed of a product badly, it can fall around essential profits in the price margin that follows the traffic intensity.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Mehwertsteuer-relatively the price increase of the "Napi" Market basket turned out in the last year so radically, that the most expensive basket crossed the value of 2006 about 1720 forint, wohingegen the difference in prices at the cheapest basket only 844 forint was.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This year such extremes were not observed, there the most expensive basket about 1.630,00 forint more cost, when in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price climb of 1.284,00 forint.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In the comparison of the two last Christmas seasons a catastrophic increase in prices was proved, the price of the daily consumption articles in the hypermarkets increased in little as 20 months around more than 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24"> (This in turn confirms not unconditional the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungarians: Near some basic foods the Statistical office found a more than 30-prozentige price increase in the period of 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="25"> So in about next to flour also near eggs.)</seg>
<seg id="26"> One flings a look, however, into the "Napi" Market basket, this shines at Latter almost impossible, since the price level of the product expensive already in the previous year did not go up around hardly more than 10 percent even in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Obviously there are flour suppliers in a stronger position, as the Eilieferanten - after all they could shift the drastic increase in prices to the Multis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> In the golden commercial triangle the hypermarkets do not complain; People report constantly about good years.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Our experience shows that the majority of the customers does not look at the prices anymore at all in the three department stores.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Great amounts are bought from everything, lasting foods go in palettes above the counters.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Wednesday morning there were in all three department stores endless snakes with the cash when suddenly the number of the customers exploded.</seg>
<seg id="32"> However, a smaller customer frequency is told by the country so that many Multis complain with the pollsters, they could not achieve even the planned turnover, and indeed not only with foods, but also near lasting consumer goods.</seg>

<seg id="1"> In many places disinfectants are economized on</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Became wage more than a thousand infections in hospitals that were to be put down to an inappropriate contact with antibiotics registers.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of the personnel - everything factors, that the embankment of the infections not just zuträglich are, so the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In many places people save also near the disinfectants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the traumatology-department of the János hospital a MRSA-infection was diagnosed recently.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The bacterium resistant against antibiotics was found in a masculine patient who was hospitalized after a hard accident.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The patient was isolated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At the beginning of the year there was here already a similar infection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The injured person of a hard car accident was released from the hospital, little later the man had to return, however, with a MRSA-infection. An important operation could not be carried out since then because of the bacterium which is still in the body of the patient yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Until 10th December of this year 1094 infections activated by multiresistant exciters onto the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System were announced from hospitals, according to the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.</seg>
<seg id="11"> So many, infections activated by multiresistant exciters were registered in the hospitals therefore with security, the darkness digit might be, however, higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were activated to that from the MRSA against Methicillin-Oxacillin of resistant Staphylococcus aureus.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium bears about a third of the people in their nose without its causing an illness.</seg>
<seg id="14"> SA-conditional infections (as about inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) react mostly well to antibiotics, they are well curable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The means are proportioned, however, too highly or used inappropriately, arise from the well respondierenden bacteria antibiotics-resistant, that expand quickly under corresponding conditions in the hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="16"> In particular with patients with immune system weakened, or functioning badly permanently, however also in older, or patients with small body weight can these bacteria difficult infections, as for instance wound infection or blood poisoning, that is sepsis, cause.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> According to the medical conductor of the János hospital the MRSA-infection is not anything special, such incidents appertain to the sick person house everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="18"> One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi - there are not MRSA only over there, where it is not searched.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Resistant against antibiotics</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff bears rubber gloves and masks during the supply, and we have the antibiotics, necessary for the treatment," - so Tibor Nyulasi.</seg>
<seg id="21"> With their admission into the hospital the patients are examined indeed for MRSA, nevertheless an infection can always not be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Sampling too rare</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The majority of the infections activated by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, however, the conditions currently being there and circumstances are unfavorable for the embankment of the origin or the spreading of the multiresistant exciter, Karolina Böröcz says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> After this infection mainly occurs in hospitals and homes for the elderly, the taken patients should examine the hospitals and MRSA-infected immediately isolate.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not practised, however, so frequently.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Last but not least because it vonseiten the state health insurance no subsidies for this investigation gives.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Most cases would not come to light before then therefore if the patient has already a noticeable MRSA-infection, according to the medical head of the epidemiology center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> There are strict recommendations for the corresponding application of antibiotics to Vonseiten of the European Union in the humane medicine, there are, however, guidelines also in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be precise, that is, microbiological investigations are necessary so that no resistance to the means can form itself, however, this directive is not always kept by hospitals either.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Among the itinerant ones, or themselves in the basic supply of contained patient microbiological sampling are even even rarer, so Karolina Böröcz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> People save near the disinfectants</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is transmitted on the other one by the nursing staff from a patient most frequently.</seg>
<seg id="33"> Just therefore the manual washing, or the carrying of gloves and masks are of a great importance, however, there are also on this field considerable shortcomings in the hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> MRSA is transmitted through droplet infection or contact, in the domestic hospitals always the possibility to isolate the infected patient does not exist, however.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The rooms are even often full, the beds just at each other follow, although there should be a distance of at least 1,5 meters between them from epidemiological view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> As Karolina Böröcz keeps on saying, it happens unfortunately in the financially less well set hospitals even that near disinfectants saves there are few nurses, many patients - everything factors that almost favor the origin of infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Such infections are nachweislich far less frequent there, and/or the further circulation of the exciter, where these protective measures are kept to can be stopped, according to Karolina Böröcz.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Government program against MRSA</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Therefore agreeing with MRSA-infections into the grip causes enormous costs to the health insurances they are combated everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="40"> In England for example the prevention of MRSA, and/or their embankment was held in the government program.</seg>
<seg id="41"> According to first signs the program is successful - as published data prove, the tendency of the MRSA infections is regressive in England.</seg>
<seg id="42"> The European center for illness prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the origin of multiresistant exciters (under that also MRSA), as soon as the prevention of infections declares as one of his priorities in hospitals.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Bulgaria, the immovable-paradise of the EU</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The development of the Bulgarian property market is fabulous - whole Europe looks attentively at the Balkans state formerly rarely mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="3"> What, where, and who the EU that, however, becomes in a fast way more expensive buys at the still cheapest market?</seg>
<seg id="4"> An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Bulgaria is currently without a doubt the most sought after plaster for immovable purchases in the East European room, with favorable ski studio apartments and houses at the sea.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Between the mountains the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa number among the most popular, at the sea Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historical small towns Sozopol and Nessebar are the runners, however, immovables are asked to more ever around Kavarna and Balcik.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> To attract investors according to assessments of Re/Max analyst in Bulgaria wid also the inland sooner or later, so for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the distinctly favorable area of Russe records more buyers.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The capital Sofia offers also enticing offers - commercial and office faces offer highest net yields.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfer paradises, and to attract tourists thus next to the summer and winter season also in the two other seasons.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Foresighted investors shop therefore already now in the great style, for example around Bansko.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> According to analysts people who acquire immovables in Bulgaria strive also for a change of their conduct.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Most buyers are English, also prospective customers come, however, from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present while there are being mainly Russian buyers near the Black Sea and in the ski fields.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> There are three groups of foreign buyers, Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgarien, says.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Those that want to sit down either revitalisierte immovables buy euro, or houses come down around 5-15.000 around 50-100.000 euro, that renovate it then themselves.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Good connection and accessibility as well as communication options are written in a large way, but also the proximity to a city, businesses and doctors are decisive for the buyers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Those appertain to the second category, who are in search of a vacation residence (Bulgaria was listed in December under the top Ten Urlaubszielen of the Germans).</seg>
<seg id="18"> Businessmen define the third group, that with the objective of one middle- to long-term accretion invest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Meanwhile immovables in the capital become constantly more expensive, necessitated by the always wachsende demand.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Within the EU the immovable prices are lowest indeed in Bulgaria, in the last five years there was a price increase, however, around annual 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The price increase with the immovable prices exceeds the increase of the salaries by far.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Fodor and the six Hungarian percent</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> As environmental minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings end on Tuesday, and the debate about the international climate-regime after 2012 is continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss about the timetable of Bali, in which the emission-reducing measures for the time after 2012, therefore after the Kyoto protocols, defined are.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Currently a vehement debate is in progress between industry and development countries.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The USA signaled already that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers, however, they would be ready to reduce the hothouse gas emissions around 25-40 percent to 2020 in comparison with 1990.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The other great question of the conference is whether the industrial countries are ready next to the reduction of the emissions the developing countries both financial, than to support also technologically.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Also an agreement about the support was achieved by developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The one subordinated to the Kyoto protocols adaptation fund is supposed to be administered by a 16-headed council, probable at the Globalen Umweltfazilität (GEF) of the UNO, as in the "Piac és profit" is to be looked up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Hungary's six percent</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The attempt of the EU to retain their role of the pioneer with global climate protection measures, and to achieve a new international agreement to 2009 supports environmental minister Gábor Fodor on behalf of Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The minister that becomes EU until in 2020 the hothouse gas emissions reduce around 20 % (measured by the values by 1990) declared independently of that whether the "Getting off after 2012" is achieved successfully, or not. The union would be even ready to support a 30-prozentige reduction soferne other great industrial countries of the world, and/or developing countries also ready are, their obligations according to strengths and to come later responsibly.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Gábor Fodor stressed that the aim of the states that had joined the Kyoto protocols in 1997 was a reduction only of 5,2 percent wohingegen the EU with theirs then 15 member states already for a minus of 8 % had obliged.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The handicap for Hungarians says reduction of the hothouse gas emissions around 6 % in comparison with the years 1985-87 - a handicap that will absolutely fill the country as in the press release of the environmental ministry is to be looked up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The use is high on Bali - after all the long-term international climate-political agreement must be within two years ready, otherwise it would come into force with security first after 2012. In This Case no renewed, international emission reduction system would follow the reduction projects defined in the Kyoto protocols, whose importance also the IPCC has emphasized, the scientific climate change committee of the UNO in his recent report international, honored with the Nobel peace prize.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Through that the emission reduction would be delayed, and the rise of the average temperature of the earth around more that would result extremely fatal and irreparable consequences in the consequence according to Wissenschaftern than 2°C would be unavoidable.</seg>

<seg id="1"> British army recruits on YouTube</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Units of the British army published photos about operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan for the purpose of popularity increase on the video portal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> First of all the British air force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan load since March 2006 videos about operations led against the Taliban into the net, the BBC tells.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The photos turned with miniature cameras attached on helmets are controlled at the air force foothold in Kandahar and sent then to London, where they are put into the Internet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Political message unavoidable</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Soldiers of the air force contributed in already 139 such photos, was had at their "channel" a look more than 75.000 times.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The British Ministry of Defense became under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring 2007 also the British Department of State (Commonwealth Office) registers in order to publish videos, however, about Iraqi and Afghan operations and the international peace troops stationed in Iraq (MNFI) have own YouTube channels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Use in Afghanistan</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Originally the air force recruited the videos with the objective soldiers, publishes, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions serve also the purpose for informing the population of the actual objectives of the foreign actions.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Such kind's published propaganda is almost free in comparison with traditional television commercials, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, however, these videos always take a certain measure of political message into themselves since they confirm the right to exist of the military measures decided on by the government in own way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Recruiting Americans with game</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The army must fight, however, also against amateur photos that get it also into the net next to the carefully dealt, zensurierten photos - as about such that show the death of the soldiers: In the a little hypocritical, "official" propaganda films talks about the losses at most, the bloody pages of the war are not shown, however.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> From the theaters of war in Iraq and in Afghanistan after all already numerous videos turned in the use were loaded onto the platform, the Britons discovered this "type" only recently, however, for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Meanwhile the Americans recruit in the a little different way, indeed with the freely herunterladbaren firing-game "America's Army" in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier within the framework of a more or less life-loyal simulation.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Political Capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the view of the department of risk analysis (Risk Analysing Division) of Political Capital the activities began the Hungarian's founded in this August with support of the "movement for a better Hungary" guard the risk Hungary's and the region's in several respect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the "risk warning report" of the institute it is called among other things: In Connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard the highest political risk sets the "sharpening of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary dar, that could lead to violent ethnic quarrels even at short notice".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Main reason for that is the strategy of the Hungarian guard which presumably aims at the provocation of such a quarrel, according to the research institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> How tells looks this as a lapse on the part of the political persons responsible: "Persons of the public life left the discussion of the Roma-question with representatives of radical political grouping who now based their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian-contrast".</seg>
<seg id="6"> One presumes, that this the problem intensify, to make the reasonable dialog impossible, extremities favor as soon as the probability of violent quarrels would increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Forschungsinsitut in addition thinks the activities of the Hungarian Guard would have last but not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad considerably damaged, in particular what "affects" the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> We remember: Since fall 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups is continuous in Hungary in the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several were founded, "national self-defense association" naming organizations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "This grouping is common, that they call themselves as civilian organization in each case while they are boasting about that openly their members on - sometimes armed - defense tasks of preparing (Disaster protection, national defense, Ordnungshütung), under appointment on the unsuitability of the police, the army, and/or the state itself," called it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> And wider: That all happens according to that method, that one attempts to camouflage as middle class initiative attempts different, based onto the political and party moroseness of the population, political.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The stress of the civilian character and the association form are only not used therefore for the avoidance of juridical hurdles that could emerge in the course of the registration near court - it is at the same time a political strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> As is to be understood from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard represent a risk-increasing factor also for the relationships with the neighboring states.</seg>
<seg id="13"> "In the last months the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighboring states as a potential safety hazard, some ultranationalistischer politician of certain neighbor countries sees in the origin of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of his own anti-Hungarian politics.</seg>
<seg id="14"> That all has effects on the political stability of the region -" it was called".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> From the Viewpoint of the research institute the foundation of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in central-east-Europe, thus the political risk increased for the entire region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As tells, the activities are comparable to the Hungarian guard with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation in August 2007 was announced of the right-extreme Bulgarian's National union (BNU).</seg>
<seg id="17"> In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian guard the Roma mass outrages which occurred in a quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana) stood.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The BNU took as an opportunity the incidents for the foundation of the National Guard now, with the argument that the objective of the organization is the "national protection".</seg>
<seg id="19"> In your opinion a regular "gypsy terror" was indeed perceptible in the last 17 years in Bulgaria, the state remained, however, idle and indifferent - so Political Capital.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And wider: The initiative would have kicked a vehement debate loosely in the Bulgarian public.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As saidly, the increased risk for ethnic quarrels is proved also by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard to resistance purposes.</seg>
<seg id="22"> There the activities of the Hungarian Guard up to now many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard shows, not to exclude it is, that the Hungarian Roma also, it means to react to the threats with the organizing of their own protection, in the risk warning report by Political Capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Attila Juhász, research director with Political Capital said on demand the news agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Annually risk analysis reports would be published, and should be recognizable risk-changing tendencies, the public opinion is informed, as in the case through the publication of the risk warning-report.</seg>

<seg id="1"> High days are not holidays everywhere</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In Hungary holidays are controlled so that the practice of the planning of the working days established itself in the meantime around the holidays, however, given by law exactly us the coming year little such days.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Also in the EU and in America one means something different by"holiday".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and work-free days.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Work-Free Days are mostly ecclesiastical holidays, or are related with significant historical events.</seg>
<seg id="6"> We celebrate for example also New Year: Both the last day of the old one, as also the first day of the new year work-free days are - latter alone to be able to rest already with that the New Year's Eve revelers.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the whole year we have in total fourteen holidays.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The state holidays are the 15th March to remind of the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd October, the commemoration day of the revolution of 1956.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On 20th August the state foundation is celebrated on 1st May the work, at the 1st and 2nd November we commemorate our dead woman.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In addition there are each two holidays to Easters, Whitsun, andChristmas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> There ours State-, National- or religious holidays rare on a weekend fall, the practice of the "working day shift" persisted in the cases in which we would work before or after the holiday only a day.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The price of the prolonged weekends is, however, that we very presumably work on the Saturdays in front of that, or must go into the school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> When this day, that before or after the holiday falls, final is supposed to be worked off, is defined since long years by the work minister in an own regulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The right regulation is valid for all work donor and taker, for public employees and officials of the public service equally.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Only companies and facilities are excluded, in which the company without interruption is carried on, therefore also on the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The working regulations are only still brought to wage a little messily by the holidays at the end of the year: From the 24th December the life conks out in these parts ceremonially since most take time balancing, or the vacation especially picked up for that for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In the next year more holidays fall into the week middle, and/or onto the end of the week so that there will be less rescheduling at the working days than this year.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The calendar is put first on the head around the day of the work so that the people can remain four days now at the piece at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saturday, the 26th April becomes a working day, in this way the Friday, 2nd May a rest day can be.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The second rescheduling is associated with the holiday on 23rd October: On Saturday, which 18th October becomes one the Friday, to have to work off 24th October first of all.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The end of the year will completely stand, however, in the sign of the holidays after from the 24th December it remains to lie everything and to stand even if New Year's Eve fells on a Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Six quenching trifles, in order to annoy colleagues</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> E-mails which we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that do not strike us anymore at all: You bring "color" into the everyday life at the job.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The question whether one becomes accustomed to these small inconveniences is bare or one is confronted better with the challenge and attempts these misleading, for other annoyed situations consciously too vermweiden.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Tips.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Sorry, I forgot to tell you that somebody of the marketing department called - a colleague says".</seg>
<seg id="6"> That one missed a meeting through that?</seg>
<seg id="7"> At best one regrets it and attempts to make up again when maybe one phones the marketing department and confesses remorsefully one would have forgotten, to achieve the information (that is that one little usual method).</seg>
<seg id="8"> Mostly the thing with an excuse is laughed away.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Before one involves oneself in embarrassing excuses, one should consider, with which one can truly prepare unpleasant moments for his colleagues and attempt to avoid these situations consciously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> A little borrowed, which does not belong to one even?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> There is not hardly a little Pithier than if one grasps a document, office accessories, or the telephone nevertheless it is not there.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Yesterday the notebook device still lay on the desk - it is today earlyaway?</seg>
<seg id="13"> Or that one is lost believed ball-point pens discovered for instance on the desk of a colleague?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Without one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow, because they are annoyed that something disappeared if they find.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Therefore, no envelopes or Post-its from the office put into the bag, because it could affect one even: no one more there, if nevertheless man's needs urgently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Getratsche about the private life of the colleagues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> There is not any effective means to stop a gossip which already was started.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Who with whom, done something?</seg>
<seg id="19"> Where and why?</seg>
<seg id="20"> One should not tie the information (or supposition) about the private life of the colleagues as far as possible to everyone to the nose!</seg>
<seg id="21"> And if nevertheless somebody opens for himself and his innermost secret betrays us, we should not misuse this confidence!</seg>
<seg id="22"> Best one keeps quiet as a grave, instead of that just not person presents to adjust even if other know also answer about the problems of the colleague.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Without reason in a sick way announced?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If one calls in the office in order to answer under appointment on tormenting headaches in a sick way because one just feels uneasy, or only simply liked to take a rest, one should realize one thing: The own work, unaufschiebbare Erledigungen, the colleagues must finish projects with fixed appointments now instead of one even.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore!</seg>
<seg id="26"> If one knows already on day before that one will not get it into the office on the next day, or that something could get in the way, for which one must stay at home, one should announce it in time, in this way neither the colleagues, to be confronted still the head unexpectedly with the absence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Gesumme, giggle, making a call</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> One is hollow just in his work, is disturbed, however, suddenly from the loud giggle of the colleagues?</seg>
<seg id="29"> Overheard unintentionally a telephone conversation, which one should not have heard better?</seg>
<seg id="30"> One should say the colleagues not with sums, singing, conversations (that one leads over their heads), trample, permanent chiding or moaning irritate.</seg>
<seg id="31"> That all can be very much bothering also if they are not hollow just in a task (to write people organize people plan).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Are always the other ones guilty?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> A project is not period of time-raked ready, one has an important letter or forgotten important Nachrichte to send, one should not search the fault of the own forgetfulness at other!</seg>
<seg id="34"> As far as possible one should not talk out onto the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!</seg>
<seg id="35"> Best one admits his errors, and apologizes if other were affected also by that!</seg>
<seg id="36"> The question how one can make up for the error again, or make up for the missed thing is only far too made!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In the office - a feeling as at home?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Tracksuit bottoms and Schlapfen: Force for at home, nothing lost, however, in the office!</seg>
<seg id="39"> Not even then one should dress so leger if the job approved it actually!</seg>
<seg id="40"> Only not to become too slovenly - one should both his colleagues, than also themselves even so far respect, that one dresses in according to the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!</seg>

<seg id="4"> I turn the volume more highly.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The speed changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a feminine choir.</seg>
<seg id="6"> It is the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar which rings out onmr2.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The domestic music scene did just not spoil us long time with qualitative Electropop.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, now one sees even the jam different if one hears the new album of Zagar in this case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The appearance of Yonderboi, so manch new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground scene contribute slowly to a change of the overall picture, and self when the garage skirt with his Gitarrengequitsche is again "in" the domestic Electropop proves: There is new one under the sun.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Balázs Zságer began in Pécs, played music even in the band Yonderboi, before it - maybe, because an inn takes none two piper - his own way to walk along began.</seg>
<seg id="11"> It created the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music that melts elements together from jazz, Electronic, and pop, however, first than one with the request, to compose the soundtrack for a film, onto it had confronted (e.g..</seg>
<seg id="12"> "Szezon" of Ferenc Töroek).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The formation that at the beginning had performed in smaller clubs became known to the wider public first, as the magazine "wan2" their first album from the year 2002 under the top 50 domestic nightmares followed and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to the almost only one chose, also in the west marketable trendsetter.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Without a doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", it did not interest, however, any whether they bear this brand also with pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The band reacted, as it should: With a new, even better album.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The now appeared new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could reveal them new ways, however, already the title expresses the wish with the Pécser years according to continuity.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The expression originates indeed from the time, when Balázs Zságer was still on the way with another band.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The airy, flying allusion would be also in order, to fall, however, next to the ethereal character of the music the - corresponding to the spirit of the time and the trends - louder guitar, the influences of the rock'n'roll on.</seg>
<seg id="19"> With these songs the singer Gyoergy Ligeti living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle" introduced himself during the premiere in the Millenáris.</seg>
<seg id="20"> A song of the album created it even for the radio hit - that as of quite recently of early set to mr2 Petfi sending pop music late to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love" that was recorded by six domestic singers ("Underground Divas") under collaboration successively the earwig.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Everything all right therefore (?).</seg>
<seg id="22"> The hvg.hu asked with Balázs Zságer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent does your music of a certain shift keep on being reserved?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Balázs Zságer: The concept "shift music" doesnot intimate just much to me.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In my opinion there are two castes in the pop music, and indeed not main stream and underground, or Alternativ and pop, but Kommerziell and honest.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Even the so-called alternative or underground-music can be shallow and meaningless, just the same they can also be produced, however, only for the sale which turns it into commercial music.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Also a good pop-number can arise from an honest motive.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The acceptance of the listener functions also according to this principle, independently of languages and borders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the frankness of the Hungarian one and the foreign public opposite your music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> B. Zs.: Abroad, in particular west of us the pop music has a greater tradition.</seg>
<seg id="31"> There not only teenagers or Twens onto concerts, but also the older public go.</seg>
<seg id="32"> You pursue the trends in the pop music that pass around them around, much more attentive, because they hold it also for a part of the contemporary culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> hvg.hu: Which role is attributed to the public during yourwork?</seg>
<seg id="34"> It is important, who, where, how many hear your music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> B. Zs.: A good feeling to see is natural it that to come to our concerts more and more.</seg>
<seg id="36"> We have never composed, however, for the market.</seg>
<seg id="37"> With us the music does not arise in order to be used for a purpose but for a certain reason.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The role of the public is perceptible mostly at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is that one in turn only in the unreachable changes of the moment.</seg>
<seg id="39"> Nevertheless one struck me: You want to make it all right, you are not more interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example fromYonderboi?</seg>
<seg id="41"> It is as a soloist on the way and ratherestablished his career in the west.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> B. Zs.: We do not go in fact his way, once from that very foreseen that one attempts again and again to interpret this in into our music.</seg>
<seg id="43"> We rather see ourselves than Teamplayer who trust in the musical presence of the other one and they make themselves unfold.</seg>
<seg id="44"> At the beginning comparisons of our work with that one were of course inevitable from Yonderboi since several of us come from his band and took another way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petfi "Wings of Love"stands at first place.</seg>
<seg id="46"> Many heard the name Zagar first in connection with thisnumber.</seg>
<seg id="47"> Was the opening with an a little more popular style in the direction consciously of a wider public produced?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> B. Zs.: We did not have any plans to write a hit which then is supposed to serve as a train horse for the album.</seg>
<seg id="49"> In this song it is a question of more.</seg>
<seg id="50"> It was considered as a final of the album with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the a little more difficult topics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?</seg>
<seg id="52"> Why just they, what the leading-principle was?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> B. Zs.: The basic idea was to do a gospel-like choir.</seg>
<seg id="54"> Then the idea to put together the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene came.</seg>
<seg id="55"> So the six-headed choir arose - therefore Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh -, that we christened to apäter "Underground Divas" then.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> hvg.hu: You wanted to have the song just the same, or did the girls co-design it?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> B. Zs.: There was the number already longer in the instrumental version, but when the material was ready for the album, we thought that this number still needs something.</seg>
<seg id="58"> The piecework sequence demanded ceremonially according to asong voice.</seg>
<seg id="59"> I sang the melody still in the same night, later the girls learned it.</seg>
<seg id="60"> It everything came virtually immediately and frightening spontaneous.</seg>
<seg id="61"> I can remember, I was then quite electrified, but one already needed also the "divas".</seg>
<seg id="62"> With my voice alone the song would never have become sostrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> hvg.hu: Both on the plate, when also during the concert one had, however, the impression the girls would be in the background.</seg>
<seg id="64"> There is not any solo part (foreseen from the short solo from Judy Jay), they do not have any own role, they completely sing together and they are not louder, as the music, therefore their song is not only accompanied from the music.</seg>
<seg id="65"> Also on the stage they stood behind.</seg>
<seg id="66"> Is it intention?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67"> B.Zs.: That they stood behind was like this because ofproblems technical in that.</seg>
<seg id="68"> However we wanted to them consciously not to made any soloroles be attributed.</seg>
<seg id="69"> In the number it is a question also of one being supposed to forget his ego a little bit, forgotten, who from where come and where it is on the way, we let in simply too, that us lift these certain wings, the wings of the love.</seg>
<seg id="70"> I would have with pleasure, that also other sense this euphoric state that we sensed than the song arose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> hvg.hu: Which one was the most extensive song?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="72"> B. Zs.: During the musical work work of no actually at all, there were rather while mixing more difficult tasks.</seg>
<seg id="73"> For example with "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or with "rock'n'roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove did not want to function longer, nevertheless little by little everything turned out, as with a puzzle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> hvg.hu: Which one is your darling number of the new album?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75"> B. Zs.: That changes with the concerts constantly and also now, where I have the album "losgelasssen".</seg>
<seg id="76"> Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Bottomless swindler</seg>
<seg id="3"> So the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerní banka, describes his former Done Jerome Kerviel.</seg>
<seg id="4"> She lost indeed almost five billion euros because of it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It does not seem, however, rather so that Kerviel was only a tall player that wanted to do it like his colleagues in addition surely incapable was.</seg>
<seg id="6"> For the difference to all big bank houses he recognized the crisis in time at the amerikanischenn mortgage market.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "It is psychologically rather weak", was to be heard from the mouth of his superiors that announced it near the police.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It a human being who had achieved profits at the end of last year with his businesses at the level of 1,6 billion euros was how, however, Kerviels which the French media, for example the daily paper Le Monde, published follows from the statements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Crisis not only in America</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> "All which I wanted money was to be earned for my bank", he says in his statement.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In the summer he had succeeded in earning half a billion of euros just from the American crisis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> He had already indeed at the year beginning spotted the occasion forthis purpose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> In February there was already first news about so-called sub-prime-mortgages as they are given to income-weak customers or such which already formerly had installment problems turning out in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="14"> This crisis should not have influence on the whole economy, however.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Kerviel did not believe that and was right.</seg>
<seg id="16"> At the end of the year it had screwed his profit highlyup to 1,6 billion euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "Already than I the first half billion had earned, I did not know, as I that should not declare", Kerviel adds and passes on that it did not keep anything definitively for itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> During the whole interrogation he admits that he forged documents so that one would not come him to the pulps.</seg>
<seg id="19"> He succeeded even in leading his heads behind the light even if the Eurex stock exchange was interested in his businesses by degrees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Risk profit</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Did he fear to fly up?</seg>
<seg id="22"> Presumably hardly.</seg>
<seg id="23"> "I thought, that they the simple fact, that I have earned for the bank 1,6 billion, satisfies."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> From where did he take the courage to risk so much?</seg>
<seg id="25"> He had to acquire his position in a step by step way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> It came into the Société Générale in the year 2000, immediately after it had ended his study at the Lyons university, one.</seg>
<seg id="27"> His annual salary was about 51000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="28"> After two years he was already assistant of a broker and in the year 2005 he became selfcontinuous broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Nevertheless he knew that he will never earn as much as other ones.</seg>
<seg id="30"> "Already at my first conversation in the year 2005 I knew that one observed me.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development", Kerviel declared the investigator.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> But already soon to his entry the first great success came.</seg>
<seg id="33"> With the stocks of the alliance he earned a lot in his putting half a billion of euros on course losses of this title with the London bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="34"> And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Solang du Gewinn make, we let to you</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> "That is as a snowball", he said to the policemen.</seg>
<seg id="37"> But the heads supposedly out of everything knew,and/or foresaw it.</seg>
<seg id="38"> "As long as I earned money, one closed the eyes."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> However, then the great stroke came at the beginning this year.</seg>
<seg id="40"> On a single day he lost a billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="41"> At a weekend in the middle of January wanted to balance it that.</seg>
<seg id="42"> When he came to the work on Monday, he was already not anymoreemployees' of the bank.</seg>
<seg id="43"> And a few days later the bank announced that she lost five billion euros because of it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> And as came they it onto the pulps?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> It looked suspicious through a vacation.</seg>
<seg id="46"> "I took only four days of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="47"> A broker who does not take any vacation is one who does not want one to look to him into the cards", Kerviel said definitively.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday in total nine development programs through which the Czech Republic can come to 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) in the next years.</seg>
<seg id="3"> It is a question approximately here of half of the sum which Tschechien can receive in the years 2007 to 2013 anyway from Brussels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> About 125 billion crowns come from seven regionaldevelopment programs.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns assignedly from the program "Doing and innovation".</seg>
<seg id="6"> Most the most money, about 150 billion, will flow into the trafficexpansion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The traffic program is the biggest development program and covers up to 22 percent of the means which Tschechien can receive from the fund.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This money increases correspondingly the budget of the State traffic infrastructure ground which will be in charge of 90,8 billion next year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The program "Doing and innovation" is supposed to serve entrepreneurs and companies to winning resources to innovative enterprises.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty year long prison sentence for the former president Arnold Alemán to whom he had been condemned in 2003 because of finance fraud at the level of 100 million dollars (almost 1,8 billion crowns).</seg>
<seg id="3"> Later, however, he had been released from the prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda near the nicaruanischen metropolis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state finds out grating again is currently unclear according to the AP news agency.</seg>
<seg id="5"> According to the chairperson of the court of appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will depend now on the custody officials whether one makes Alemán sit out his punishment at home or whether it into the prison must.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A court proved that Alemán had moved money of the government regularly onto accounts of foreign companies in Panama four years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These companies were fictitious and the accounts belonged in reality to his relatives and narrowest supporters.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Some of this money landed finally in a fund that Alemán for the financing of his election campaign 2001 had established.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Budget is through</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yes, it is created.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The national budget is approved of.</seg>
<seg id="4"> What is special one at this budget?</seg>
<seg id="5"> It is the first budget which this government projected, and which was accepted without support of the opposition through the coalition majority.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The for the current year the SSD (Social democrats) was still approved of with support because minister Sobotka had presented it (of this party), and the SSD could not allow it therefore to refuse it.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike the lively debate in front of the vote about the motion of no confindence against the government nothing dramatic happened this time.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The parliament approved of this traditionally few paid attention to, nevertheless highly important law calmly.</seg>
<seg id="9"> That is in a way paradoxical.</seg>
<seg id="10"> All governance begins and ends with the single chapters and posts of the budget, whether one likes that or not.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The budget is an essential component of the politics, is concealed, however, by the power fight of the government and the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="12"> That is a more thankful topic for the media, and therefore they dedicate more attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A quarrel among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober numbers are.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The national budgets suffered from three weak points that the budget can not remove for the year 2008 at the same time near the last social-democratic governments:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The first is the high part of editions, that are of because of law obliging, at which it is not a question only of the pensions, but also around social expenditures which the "silent" coalition of SSD and KSM (Communists) in the last year in front of the choices decided on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The second is the defizitäre budget policy as a consequence of the first weak point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The third restriction consists in the deficits of the public finances, that is the budget deficits of the municipalities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id="19"> This budget is public and eingermassen under control.</seg>
<seg id="20"> A true time bomb is, however, the budget deficit of themunicipalities.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Many mayors often distributed debentures through which their city halls caused it in the excess in order to develop further sources from taxes, deliveries and bank loans except for gains for investments without careful consideration.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In the last years they succeeded in it, these debts through massive sale of stocks the Energy- and other supply networks' that they had received in the course of the denationalization of the state pay off.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Now this source already versiegt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> As far as we stick only to official and nachprüfbare facts, we find, that:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> our economy already since some years, as the rest of the world, a growth phase which the SSD incessantly boasts about ran through.</seg>
<seg id="26"> That represented a unique possibility for their governments to sort out the public finances.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Instead of this these governments got into debt the state, however,still more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Other countries, foreseen from a few exceptions as Hungarians, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more reasonable than our republic.</seg>
<seg id="29"> That is a giant disgrace which is mainly to be ascribed to the former governments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> We belong to the countries which are threatened, seen, least from poverty in the global standard.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Therefore no nassiven social programs which were blown up unfortunately just in the last years very superfluously in gigantic scale are necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Even if has succeeded in deleting a part of the senseless populistischen editions that were adopted this year in front of the choices, is clear, that if it does not come in next time for a shift of the pension entry age and for a pension reform, then virtually any politics in this country, and, very now who is at the power ends, he will not have anything as a pure administration.</seg>
<seg id="33"> It is only easily exaggerated if one says that officials that divide up the biggest part of the tax yields mechanically on pensions and social expenditures become then from ruling politicians.</seg>
<seg id="34"> Therefore the this year's budget can not be a revolution, but it can stop only the displacement of normal editions through duty editions.</seg>
<seg id="35"> That for 2008 designated deficit of 70 billion crowns would be absolutely superfluous, if former governments had not distributed in the last ten years, which only worked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If we do not want pure administration officials to become from ruling politicians that in fact it results in that, we must be patient then and this coalition government not far too strong, that it is conscious of that that the state can issue only as much as it is to charm in the situation at taxes and fees rest during the preparation of further reform laws want.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Only these facilitate a step-by-step enforcement of a harmonious national budget.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided on fighting against the crisis together on the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="3"> So more than 100 billion dollars will reach by means of auctions onto the currency markets.</seg>
<seg id="4"> On these auctions the banks interest rates auction, to which they are ready to lend money mutually.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> For example the American Fed sends 40 billion dollars on auction, wider she forks out 24 for the European one and the Swiss central bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It is after the assaults of the 11.September the first time that the central banks of the single states agree on a so coordinated procedure to the defense and/or Abmilderung of the consequences of a financial crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "This step is supposed to remove the greatest difficulties of the economy, therefore" Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote "the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can lend" in a report for his customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> "The probability of a recession reduced the coordinated action of the central banks in the USA of 65 % on about 50 %", Baumohl added in his report.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The banks lost because of not operated credits already around 60 billion dollars, particularly in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts expect even further billion losses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "This central banks must have been afraid of what still everything can follow when decided on this procedure real" the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies, said.</seg>
<seg id="12"> "It looks like this that the situation is in fact bad" he passed on.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The central banks have the apprehension that if the banks themselves have access to loans heavily, to become also more expensive for their customers credits.</seg>
<seg id="14"> That would reduce the consumption and to fling the American economy into a recession, possibly with effects on the economic growth on the whole world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The central banks decided to that after their not having succeeded in it on lowering the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate that is used with the money rental company between banks.</seg>
<seg id="16"> That means that the banks were afraid continuously to lend money mutually, and that although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the fall had lowered their interest rates repeatedly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "That will have the same effect as a further drawdown of the interest rates", Greg Salvaggio of tense said to consulting of the agency of Reuters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Some analysts think that this step of the central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem and indeed the case of the property market in the USA.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Global climate changes damage supposedly developing countries most themost.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> President Václav Klaus commented again on the problems of the global warming.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The criticism referred now to Bali onto the zu Ende gehende international conference of the UNO for the climate change.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In Vienna, where it presented his book "one bluer, no green planet", he exported that the debates of the ecologists are unplausible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to Klaus only the structure of the conference that forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of non-government organizations is not inacceptable but also the basic difference between the rhetoric that she accompanies, and the reality.</seg>
<seg id="7"> "The debate there is unstructured, it is some word fireworks that is only substitute for a real solution of current problems" said Klaus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The Czech president stressed during the idea of his book that his topic is very important for it, and that he commits itself to that so therefore.</seg>
<seg id="9"> He expressed also his contentment with his book being published in German translation because "I often stumble on caricatures of my opinions."</seg>
<seg id="10"> Now prospective customers could gather hisattitude in a therefore undistorted way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Klaus reminded of his not being a Klimatologe, but he has in his opinion sufficient conditions in order to write such a book.</seg>
<seg id="12"> It is finally to understand academics, capable, professional treatises and to judge, has experience with statistics and is also to nation business person.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He referred to the thesis as a main statement of the book, that the climate is changed continuously and that his changes are therefore normal, that there is not any matching opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not far too great and serious and thus did not represent any threat for the earth warming, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate, superfluous, ineffectively and in an inacceptable way are extensive.</seg>
<seg id="14"> In addition he considers it as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen, for unacceptable to impose unproved opinions on other ones, he regards that as a dangerous restriction of the freedom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> On questions of person presents he declared repeats, he is not against "a reasonable environmental protection, however against militant eco-activists that do not take any regard onto the relation between expenditure and profit."</seg>
<seg id="16"> Klaus had already two months ago in the Hayek-institute talked about the same topic in Vienna.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Voruteile fade away</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> To say around the truth I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.</seg>
<seg id="3"> His going-properties were not a lot worth, one could refer to the quality of the gear-change, the guidance and also the processing as rather lower-average.</seg>
<seg id="4"> However, now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that one is better around many things.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The station wagon with the SW denomination is another piece wider, and revising my opinion only remains to me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When I of the classical Hatchback of the 207 had tested, I had to complain for example about the too small head freedom on the rear seats.</seg>
<seg id="7"> There are not these complaints now anymore, because the bodywork of the station wagon is so formed that not even two meter men will suffer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Quickly wider</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> I go through the interior trim only shortly in order not to repeat myself too very much.</seg>
<seg id="10"> It is a question of a quite succeeded design, where I have only because of the miserable central tunnel's objections.</seg>
<seg id="11"> There I would welcome a little more designerische organization, where otherwise the car does a so elegant impression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The seats are comfortable, and past the times are where we complained about too short seats or headrests possibly.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Also the side hold improved to that considerably oppositeitself in 206.</seg>
<seg id="14"> What affects the room offer, one can sense also here the increased measurements of the bodywork.</seg>
<seg id="15"> In the station wagon also the already mentioned lack of head freedom isremoved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Suitcase into the trunk</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The main thing at this car is, however, the loadingspace|hold|payload bay.</seg>
<seg id="18"> I must designate that one (also because of the drop-down moving-window) as very well beladbar and space-saving.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The cavities are equipped with safety belts which represent an ideal compromise.</seg>
<seg id="20"> You do not disturb, make yourself be separated and hold also more difficult objects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But let's talk about the case volume.</seg>
<seg id="22"> It is according to table in the basic version 428 liters, which is a rather average value in the comparison for the competition.</seg>
<seg id="23"> However not in the comparison to the vehicle of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi, meistverkauften in Tschechien.</seg>
<seg id="24"> If we compare to the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find, that the Peugeot remains around clearly perceptible 52 liters.</seg>
<seg id="25"> For a foreign vacation or while inviting a pram this value is already critical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But in order to emphasize the Positiva, I must mention still the loading space very flat after the turnover of the back seats or also the very low sill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> 120 hp in four row</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with stroke volume 1,6 liters and an achievement of 88 kilowatts.</seg>
<seg id="29"> And a 1600-cube-engine which stimulates a Familien-Hatchback should look honestly said, so.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It is quiet, has a small consumption and migrateswell.</seg>
<seg id="31"> If I compare it with his counterpart at Škoda which sometimes works as if his exhaust with a cloth would have been blocked, I can be then only inspired by him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The price list speaks volumes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The price of this car is just not popular.</seg>
<seg id="34"> We must remember, however, our having tested a well equipped car with a spacious Innneren and a very good engine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> The basic price of the car with the 1400th gasoline engine at the level of 329900 crowns still starts.</seg>
<seg id="36"> With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns what already quite a lot is.</seg>
<seg id="37"> The equipment Premium of the test car is noticeable once again with 80000 crowns besides.</seg>
<seg id="38"> We had, however, head air bags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic windshield wiper triggering, electrical window lifters behind and and...</seg>
<seg id="39"> So the car costs in total 531900 crowns settles.</seg>
<seg id="40"> That is an amount, however you add up the options of a Fabia once and you will arrive with a very similar sum.</seg>
<seg id="41"> Therefore only still the decision which brand one wantsto choose remains.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> For visitors it is in fact an island of the freedom.</seg>
<seg id="3"> What you always expect of your vacation, that will be fulfilled if you select only the correct thing.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea which is quiet as a pond.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Including palms and space with waiters that offer pizza, ice and beguiling cocktails at the beach.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Kitesurfing, golf and roulettes.</seg>
<seg id="7"> On the islands of the Caribbean you find that in overabundant measure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Only on an island you find, however, still many more, and Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Big Antilles, is this island.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the Spaniards' times Cuba of those ones was bastion for the conquestof Americas.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Kolumbus mentioned it the most beautiful place which ever a human eye saw.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Havana became once a warehouse or transit camp of treasures which had stolen the Spaniards in America and transported the Spaniards to Europe then.</seg>
<seg id="12"> And then the American epoch came.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The hotel Nacional completely arose at the end of the 20th century.</seg>
<seg id="14"> One of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, made him be uplifted, because all that was regarded as a crime in the USA (especially during the prohibition) became on Cuba most welcome and supplementary - drugs, gambling, prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Among his guests were among other things.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Into Havana high-rise buildings increased, over the wide boulevards cars that numbered among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last Jahrhundets drove.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Ernest Hemingway bought himself an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havannas, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lie.</seg>
<seg id="19"> At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio stars of the show business and politicians from whole America left behind their signatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> And today?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> At the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana also you can leave behind your autograph.</seg>
<seg id="22"> At the bar in the hotel Nacional one mixes cocktails very asrequired for you.</seg>
<seg id="23"> And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana until today because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats in the salty and moist air fell apart a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Havana, in particular his oldest part, likes to have come down strongly, nowhere one does not find as many wonderful colonial sights here in the vicinity as just.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Other places are just herausgeputzt, for the example Trinidad.</seg>
<seg id="26"> In regard on the tourism bringing urgently needed money there was for this development green light.</seg>
<seg id="27"> In the last fifteen years new hotels did not arise only in Havana, but also in Varadero, at the coast of the province Holguín and also on islets as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and other.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Cuba offers another whim which is unique on the world and attracts particularly railroad lovers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Steam and diesel-practiced narrow gauge railways brought the sugar cane of remote plantations to the sugar works.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Your vehicle fleet was not renewed over decades, and one sees like this there locomotives droll and functioning fully whose contemporaries stand somewhere else in the museum for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Places of excursions</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The majority of the visitors of Cuba does not let out thebedeutendendsten places.</seg>
<seg id="33"> So one does not have to write about Varadero or Havana morefully.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> It remains only to mention that there is a museum whose visit that one that likes this writer should not be able to escape in the already mentioned estate Hemingways.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The Viñales-valley in the west of the island is one of the mostpicturesque angles of Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="36"> The opulent vegetation grows onto lime ground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The Mogotas, lime hill and rock, rise steeply from the valley, in their cavities fertile ground through which also weather-beaten rock fields of thick vegetation are overcast was collected.</seg>
<seg id="38"> It is this valley where the maybe best Cuban tobacco is built on.</seg>
<seg id="39"> In his final form you can stumble on it if you go to one of the cigar factories of Havana.</seg>
<seg id="40"> Possibly it seems to some also interesting that the Chilean consequence of the TV series "Major Zeman" was turned there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Trinidad</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> An ancient city which was set up shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island.</seg>
<seg id="43"> The trade with slave and sugar brought her fame andfortune.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> The fortune embodied itself in the neat beauty of the smallcity.</seg>
<seg id="45"> The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French colonizers, has hardly changed since four hundred years.</seg>
<seg id="46"> Trinidad, sited between the sea and the Escambray-mountains, is a so remote place that there was not over there any street that would have connected the area with the remaining country yet in the fifties of the last century.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> This isolation contributed to its remaining unseen.</seg>
<seg id="48"> Nothing was built there, not torn down, however, therefore also anything, it was glad to everyone that he had a roof above the head.</seg>
<seg id="49"> If one has more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worth to look at interesting places in the surroundings as about the beach playa Ancón or the "valley of the sugar works".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> At the evening one should go into the Casa de la Música that livens up according to the darkness then and where the music is not silent up to the morning.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> The National Debts of the Czech Republic increased until end of September to 842,7 billion crowns.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Within the first nine months of this year they climbed accordingly around 40,2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Since June they sank, however, around 13,4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Exchequer confirmed his information over the national debts of beginning of October with that.</seg>
<seg id="10"> A fault of 84000 crowns is allotted to every Czech.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Over the entire last year the state got into debt around more than 111 Miliarden crowns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "Until now it shines, that we will not cross the border of a trillion crowns possibly thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year before in the year 2009.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Next year the debts should "move" between 900 billion and a trillion crowns", David Marek, analyst of the Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz, said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Vladimír Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance, sees it similar: "We could come to the transgression of a trillion in the course of the year 2009.</seg>
<seg id="15"> When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not know yet.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If it should be shown that the situation is changed on the political stage, and should be ready more save, that could last up to the year 2010.</seg>
<seg id="17"> But I do not take such a change as a basis", he noticed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Debts increase</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The national debt stems from the debts of the state government and comes particularly from the accumulation of deficits of the national budget.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The national debt is financed through treasury bills, state debentures, direct loans or for example through loans of the European Investment Bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The domestic state indebtedness increased this year to 719,4 billion crowns in the meantime.</seg>

<seg id="24"> The average maturity of the national debts|publicdebts climbed 6,5 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "The total fault increased over the year up to the third quarter from the first around 13 percent, which in fact is a lot faced with that how things go for the economy well.</seg>
<seg id="26"> It is interesting that the growth particularly with the debentures, where the increase is 20 percent, is to be noted.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Pikora commented, "it is bad that the debts increase, but on the other hand this already shows that one can undertake something before the pension reform comes", the data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Better than expected</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> It follows from the financing strategy and the contact with the national debts for 2007 that the government had intended for this year to incorporate 159,2 billion crowns.</seg>
<seg id="30"> At the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan, however, thanks to the better development of the state beating hold politics on 152,8 billion crowns.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> This amount stems particularly from the state budget deficit that will reach 76 billion crowns obviously this year instead of the estimated 91,3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="32"> It keeps on being a question of maximally planned means for the consolidation agency at the level of 13,3 billion crowns, a ten billion reserve for the payment of the pensions, the financing of state debentures for 43 billion and around rates for the loans near the European Investment Bank at the level of 1,8 billion.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> According to specification of their attorney the British teacher that had been accused of insult of the Islam in Sudan on Thursday evening was condemned to 15 days of custody and subsequent expulsion by a court in Khartum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Briton was accused, allowed to pupils six to seven year old to have, a teddy bear to give the name Mahomet although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="4"> She would have deserved to be whipped.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> After parents of pupils had complained repeatedly near the Sudanese Ministry of Education, the 54-year old elementary-school teacher who was active at the Unity High School of Khartum was picked up on Sunday with themselves at home and accused to article 125 of the Sudanese penal code of the insult of the Islam.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In fact this matter takes their beginning in September when the teacher asks their pupils six to seven year old to select a name for the class teddy.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The children suggest eight names, told to Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, under that headmaster Robert Boules.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Finally when the class votes 20 of 23 children of Mohammed choose as a dearest first name.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, however particularly also a first name very frequent in Sudan.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Then the children constructed a book for the class, with which photo of the bear on that and the caption is My Name Mohammed.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The bear itself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as an insult of the Islam is very simple.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> One of the Moslem colleagues of Gillian gibbon's that teaches Sudan at the same school, declared, he knows it well, and she would never have something would have done, with which it could kick a religious belief too near, I only regret that them the children asked for voting for a name his opinion's acts it at that only around an innocent error.</seg>
<seg id="13"> An opinion that numerous pupils of the teacher divide that these as very attentive opposite their pupils and as a person, who never talks about religion in the class describe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> One considers, that the first name of Mohammed is simultaneously also the one in Great Britain at the second most frequent given second name, for which in the English 14 different spelling exists.</seg>
<seg id="15"> This first name often selected by Moslem families is regarded as a kind of respect at the prophets (it is given frequently to the first-born of a family).</seg>
<seg id="16"> But how loud the rules in the reference to the use of this first name?</seg>
<seg id="17"> One may give it for example a toy?</seg>

<seg id="1"> Spectacular repair at the space station</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades of the crew of the International space station (EAT) will have needed more than seven hours in the space in order to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar thermal collector which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific works on the station.</seg>
<seg id="3"> A risky exit that achieved several records due to his duration, the distance of habitable modules, the quickness with which it was organized, and the tools made by the astronauts in order to carry on the repair.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the space shuttle Discovery, a big cylindrical part that is supposed to include soon the European and Japanese scientific labs.</seg>
<seg id="5"> This module is a kind of pier for the module-labs.</seg>
<seg id="6"> But one must be able to supply it with stream.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It was the second task of the crew therefore to turn over a 17,5 tons heavy module for the electric power production above solar thermal collectors which was already on the ISS in order to bring it into his final position.</seg>
<seg id="8"> After she had moved it, the crew got down to the restructuring of the solar thermal collector of the module whose span is 76 meters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And it happened, that one of the commutators that can be folded as accordions was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of approximately a meter</seg>
<seg id="10"> The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the commutator anymore yet.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The astronauts who leave the space shuttle Discovery originally for a control walk and then should repair other solar thermal collector whose rotation system was faulty saw themselves forced to dedicate oneself to the damaged commutator.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> And Scott Parazynski was selected, to stroll around at the end of the 30 meters long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to that of the station in order to carry out the repair.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He is one of the best Spacewalker (Wetraumgänger) of theNASA.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Large, resistant, very sent, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The 46-jaehirige learned doctor was selected therefore, to operate on the hurt solar thermal collector.</seg>
<seg id="16"> After he had examined the damages exactly, it cut the faulty cable and attached a kind of rails on the damaged place.</seg>
<seg id="17"> He was supported by a second Spacewalker to stay near the sluice, and, of inside, of the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The astronauts had devised the tool which he used, a mini hockey stick, wrapped around with insulator in order to prevent an electric stroke on the solar thermal collectors which produce several hundreds of volts, on board the station and made the tool which he used, a mini hockey stick, wrapped around with insulator in order to prevent an electric stroke on the solar thermal collectors which several hundreds of volts produce.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> When the action was ended, Scott Parazynski waited, until the commutator was completely folded, before he counted his tools and before he turned his tools back into the station.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Yesterday afternoon enjoyed the astronauts half a day of relaxation, before seven astronauts turned round today onto the space shuttle Discovery back in order probably to enter upon the moving-flight to the earth Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The choice of the Status Quo</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On Sunday it will not become with the counting of the urns thrilling: The mass of the Russians will decide for president of Putins party, United Russia.</seg>
<seg id="3"> After an election campaign very sealed off she confirms their aspiration to stability, yes even according to authoritarianism.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Three days in front of the parliament choices the Russian president Wladimir Putin addresses an information broadcast on the public senders to the voters that already indeed was recorded, that contents, however, are kept a secret.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He does this in his property as a top candidate of the United Russia, the pros-Kremlin-party for which an overwhelming victory announces itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yesterday the president did not make anything look through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and gab zufrieden with supplying a new target against the western powers, accused that of the interference werden- his darling topic during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="7"> We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest, extremely transparent and open choices, choices without trickery, he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> From view of the opposition they vertan themselvesthere.</seg>
<seg id="9"> They prangert an election campaign stained throughsuppression.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The communist leader Günnadi Ziouganov does not say there would never have been such dirty choices even in the time of Eltsin.</seg>
<seg id="11"> According to the suppression of the demonstrations at the last weekend, is valid for ex-chess world champion Garry Kasparovder for unauthorized demonstrating to five days of custody, according to his attorney furthermore visit prohibition had been condemned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Russians preserved the mentality of the homo Sovieticus</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> After these parliament choices without tension two a lot weiterführende questions raise themselves:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">  Who will enter upon Putins succession as a president?</seg>
<seg id="15"> The office newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first ballot of the premiership choices, the 2nd March 2008; the candidates familiarized oneself until the 23rd December time.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Since it was chosen in 2000 and chosen in 2004 again, Wladimir Putin can not line up for a third mandate in consequence.</seg>
<seg id="17"> And now no successor finds himself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Which role will play Putin after March?</seg>
<seg id="19"> Prime minister?</seg>
<seg id="20"> Chairpersons' of the parliament majority and the omnipotent party United Russia, the government and president will select?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Whatever it will be, at the Parliament- or at the premiership choices, the previous power will triumph.</seg>
<seg id="22"> That is tradition.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The Russians preserved the mentality of the homo Sovieticus, they are not gentleman of their fate, the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada, thinks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the St. Petersburg State University goes back even still further: The middle class society weiterentwickelt in this country which was christianized five centuries to Europe only very much slowly; the famous esprit de corps delayed the development of individuality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> After the liberal reforms of the nineties Putin picked up the model of a paternalistic state again, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more more, there on this new paternalism's no terror followed, but a certain economical prosperity, Maria Lipman of the Carnegie donation means.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Today the Russians renounce from free pieces the personal responsibility which they laid on the day according to the decay of the USSR on a short-term basis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> To which still long held over?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> This phenomenon affects all social classes, including the business world.</seg>
<seg id="29"> And the administration elite understands to hold the Status Quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian region chairpersons) lead the local choice lists of the United Russia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The freedoms new, coming from the west are often tantamount to chaos, as in the nineties.</seg>
<seg id="31"> The general public prefers stability.</seg>
<seg id="32"> In this sense the Russians will not vote either for the extremist parties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year old professor: To which still long held over?</seg>
<seg id="34"> Those ones that are at the power are not so bad, why they pay off?</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> With just five weeks up to the annual account at the stock exchange the investors abrade themselves already the hands with regard to the coming Endjahres-Rally.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Nevertheless the experts can not create any securepredictions concerning that.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Banif believes that in that statistically considers the month of December at the stock exchange usually with a positive market trend goes around</seg>
<seg id="5"> Nonetheless it is not advisable, predictions short-term and to construct only on the basis of statistics. Particularly then not, when serious tensions to be taken determine the current market event</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Although other experts approve one such a strong course rise in the last weeks of the year not, nevertheless these say that the stock market price is designated by that one givenly liquidity of the market and the market participants. These invest due to the lack secure common stock fund main in bond funds that is there to productive capital values strongly affected by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Accordingly the stock exchange will rather show in opinion of these experts a course trend rather lateral, influenced from market fluctuations particularly because we can not estimate the scales of the possible drop of the interest rate of the US issuing bank yet, to take back an insecurity that one before all onto the climbed crude oil price and the danger of the rise of the inflation rate is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Javier Barrio, chairperson of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees with it being a risky time to announce an imminent Markt-Rally.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The chances do not stand very good, the expert assures.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But not all experts divide the same negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="12"> According to opinion of Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the Bezuschussung of the pension fund traditional, carried out every year around this time could close the year successfully with almost 16.000 points.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Nevertheless the expert emphasizes that this year the things could develop something to themselves differently; particularly due to that already in the second December week, and accordingly directly after the bridge day to the day of the constitution, occurring Endjahres-Rally.</seg>
<seg id="14"> In the view of the analyst the price fluctuations would not influence the market trends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> According to assessment of Federico Olucha, analyst near the bank Inversis, the previous judgments for the market are on an almost technical level, which could result in a deviation from the index values that scales depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis being able soon to emerge.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Popular will have opened his 200 credit institutions of on Mondays until on Fridays for 12 hours on day.</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Popular decided on modernizing a big part ofhis branches.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In in total 200 of them are settled in the economy-strongest regions of Spain.</seg>
<seg id="4"> For the institute which operates under the brand name Popular Max these subsidiaries mean a big milestone.</seg>
<seg id="5"> However also for the remaining Spanish institutes, since Popular represents as a first bank consortium the jump, to extend on weekdays to 20.30h and to apply from 10h on Saturdays to 20.30h the opening times of his branches dares.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The bank consortium BBVA, who repeats also the prolongation of their opening times in the subsidiaries announce lies, did not take up to now yet any definitive decision.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The at the time of current negotiations of the bank with the trade unions to seem to aim at an agreement in the case of which 75 % of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for that on a weekday in the afternoon when neither for the custom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Whether further banks follow the new initiative which adapts itself to the business opening times will depend on the empirical values of the Popular Bank.</seg>
<seg id="9"> And just that is also the intention that Popular withtheir project hunts.</seg>
<seg id="10"> It is objective to prolong the opening times of those branches which can capture the custom of independent, small and located centrally enterprises inclined to buy, but also the one of big department stores due to their situation.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The bank would like to open the new 200 branches in the course of the coming 18 months, there it not around new, but changed opening times sells.</seg>
<seg id="12"> For that the bank will reshape the premises of those subsidiaries which are already in business zones, and they adjust to the individual customer profile of the different zones simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="13"> So the enlargement of the opening times is joined with a new room organization of the branches which is characterized by a more current, more colorful design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require any greater investments, but it would be accompanied by an increased personnel attitude since a branch needed now no more six, but eight or nine employees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The subsidiaries which will be endowed even with additional premises for the KMU will not sell any financial products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> A positive experience for the group</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Popular already at nine branches in Madrid tested hisdraft.</seg>
<seg id="18"> And the empirical values turned out positively, according to ÁngelRivero.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The subsidiaries of the streets bravo Murillo, O´Donell and the grain Vía were selected for that, which seems a clever decision to have been.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Popular currently guides approx. 2500 subsidiaries.</seg>
<seg id="21"> And wider 60 that operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized onto immigrants and point also enlarged opening times on, even on Sundays and holidays.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In these branches of PopularMax the model is not used the BBVA since most of them will offer a wide selection instead of this at non financial service services for the sale.</seg>

<seg id="3"> With this sentence the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, made his contentment known with stock exchange end. The sender guided by it had increased his value around the twofold one of his rival Antena 3.</seg>
<seg id="4"> An aspect, however, subdued his joy: That is exactly that something me is hurt; not, that we a higher growth, but, he stated that we had smaller losses.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It stressed that they did not sink in spite of the weak market far too deeply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Telecinco ended yesterday the day with a plus of 2,54 %.</seg>
<seg id="7"> This profit reduces his previous this year's losses on 15,66 %.</seg>
<seg id="8"> According to information of Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4.488,88 million euros at which Mediaset controls the main part of the capital (52 %), and is shared to Vocento only with 13 % now.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The rival Antena 3 lost 1,52 percent points yesterday and has to announce since January a loss of in total 40,5 % so that his market value with 2.193,46 million amounts to half.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The market value of other stock exchange-noted communication enterprises on the other hand climbs; in the case of Sogecable on 3.571 million, at Prisa (Editor of the magazine Cinco Días) on 2.518,53 million and at Vocento on 1.779 million.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is a question of two similar enterprises, according to Vasile.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Still the question in which extent in fact we stock exchange technically can act appears uncertain for which price and as we can design it lucratively on customer level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Telecinco explained his intention to climb up from advertising-gains this year to the first television broadcast station with more than 1000 million gross profits a week ago. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising-enterprise of the group.</seg>
<seg id="14"> If the intention should be turned over, the sender would increase his advertising-revenues by 3,6 % in comparison with the 965,4 million from the previous year.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="16"> The analysts see the main factor for the stock exchange course of Telecinco better in the comparison at the high Payout reason, that the company could show up to the present time: In 2006 the enterprise guided by Alejandro Echevarría arranged for a 100-prozentige dividend distribution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Vasile insures, however, that the reason after the purchase of 33 % of the parts of final moles, with media set as a holding company, still could vary, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="18"> We are obliged to the official compromise, to pay at least 50 % of the parts even if we have declared more up to now always considerably.</seg>
<seg id="19"> I hope for our being able to satisfy our stockholders whose stock values we could already increase through the purchase from 33 % of the final mole parts this year.</seg>

<seg id="20"> According to statement of the analysts themarket points at the time of certain loss tendencies on.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Lehmann Brothers reduced only recently his profit calculation around 7 % at Telecinco for this year around 4 % and for 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22"> This is the consequence of the shortening of the probable growth rate which will go back to 8,4 % and 2009 in 2008 of 10,5 % from 5,5 % on 5,1 %.</seg>

<seg id="4"> In the view of the head of the government the offer is onto the former minister justified since it is important in the politics to be able to count on the best and is Bono among the best.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In addition the politician coming from the Mancha would run in the case of a victory for the socialists at the coming choices according to all appearance as a chairperson of the congress for the party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Bono would replace Manuel Martín as a congress president. This had announced on the last 15th one November not to enter upon more at the next general choices, to end his career in the public politics and to support the climate protection instead of this in the on-campus field.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Which insurance is suitable for me best?</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The KFZ insurance that covers a possible damage case caused by the driver contains a high cost whose height wiederrum depends on different factors, and other from age, sex, time of the creation of the driver's license, marital status, kind of the car to be insured and his use, and so forth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> To own a car is only the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Because the suitable KFZ insurance is to be found in an even more difficult way than the correct vehicle model is.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At first once it must be clear to one with what we have to do it here.</seg>
<seg id="6"> An selfinsurance is an agreement between an assurance company and an insured.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This agreement to present the corresponding indemnity in a damage case is held in writing by means of a contract of insurance which determines that the society receives the arranged insurance premium and is engaged in the corresponding train.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that consists through several factors, and other age, sex, time of the creation of the driver's license, marital status, kind of the vehicle to be insured or that use.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The insurance enterprises set their prices according to the statistics so that with a higher danger of accident also higher contribution payments become due.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> For this reason must both more than 25-year than also women of few contribution payments achieve, because statistics prove that these groups show a smaller accident rate thanks to their caution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The same one is valid also for married persons, there this according to statement of the statistical values and accordingly also according to conviction of the enterprises, to less accidents tend as singles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The benefit that is attributed to the vehicle influences the frequency of the driving and in this way also the probability of an accident.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The more frequent the use, the more probably the damage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The insurances must consider a whole series of points at the installation of the premium.</seg>
<seg id="15"> For this reason also the driver must study the situation thoroughly in order to select the selfinsurance which complies with his personal needs at the ehesten exactly.</seg>
<seg id="16"> We list at this place the most important points that one should take into account during the selection of an insurance now around not only one power-, but to be able to find also a price-oriented choice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The less than 25-year long ones encounter numerous obstacles, as e.g. the small going-practice and the young driver's license, during the choice of an economical insurance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Nevertheless, even if it was for an ideal insurance cover best to finish a full fully comprehensive insurance, there are more economical alternatives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The cautious drivers can select one Vollkasko with deduction so that indeed the services of a full fully comprehensive insurance are covered, but they are offered for a low price.</seg>
<seg id="20"> This kind of contract contains that the customer must pay a part of the amount itself arisen from the damage.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The amount is defined before end of the contract and by means of the height of the insurance premium. This is more highly ever smaller the sum to be paid, Luis Nogüra, main representative of Spain, declares near ridge Europe, a mediation enterprise for online insurances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Another option is not the enlarged insurance that insures the customer against external accident damages, however, against the harm arisen at the own car.</seg>
<seg id="23"> In addition this kind of the insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Here a council.</seg>
<seg id="25"> If you are less than 25 years old, it suits in your hand to lower the insurance costs; so your credit increases itself when you attempt to go cautiously and to avoid accidents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> A credit is a lowering of the base rate near the corresponding assurance company.</seg>
<seg id="27"> In the opposite for this purpose a punishment paymentcontains an increase of said rate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The height of credits and punishment payments depend from the society and those one profits.</seg>
<seg id="29"> If the enterprise has a profit-rich year behind itself, can be taken the liberty to increase the bonus-payments, Nogüra explains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> As soon as the 25-year brand is crossed, it is simpler for the drivers to sign a contract. Reason for that is the fact that with increasing going-practice the accident rate sinks.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Thus it is most reasonable to decide for a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Usually the young people can not profit from their previous experience no, both in the case of an accident and at the moment of the driving not, explains that one Spanish chief of the European enterprise, and adds, that the majority of the accidents to happen in the second practice year after the fear of the beginner was put aside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Nevertheless it is with a married customer who does not have any children more advisable to finish a full fully comprehensive insurance; natural only then, if it also approves the financial situation of the corresponding person.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> On the part of the insurers married couples with children are regarded as the customers with the least accident rate, and correspondingly low also their contribution payments turn out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> In This Case a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction would be (with an amount around the 300 euros) the best option. In the case that one received a high credit, an enlarged insurance that starts first to the third vehicle year is recommended.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> You go more loosely in total and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to apply a higher contribution payment Luis Nogüra states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> For pensioners it is good to finish a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction (with an amount around the 150 euros), or an enlarged insurance which does not start before with a sufficiently high credit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Finally one must observe that the selfinsurance is something very important not only, because it protects the driver against possible accident damages, but also, because it contains high costs that require it, that a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation is found.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> A new price quarrel smolders between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the danger that Russian exports of combustible are influenced to Western Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The biggest part of the Russian natural gas exports into the European Union (EU) is led through Ukraine and every quarrel between the two nations is observed very exactly.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4"> Kiev warned, that if Moscow increases the price that it must pay for the natural gas, it of Russia higher transit fees into account will put.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A former conflict between the two states in the last year reduced deliveries into the EU-states.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The recent quarrel between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time at which the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom attempt to achieve an agreement how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in the year 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to Gazprom more must be charged Ukraine since the company group arranged up to 50 % to pay for natural gas from the neighboring Turkmenistan.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine must pay 40 % more for the imports of Gazprom.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Mitt Romey said, he does not consider worthily of a premiership candidate to be consulted from a snowman.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In spite of that the republican candidate for the premiership declared himself ultimately readily to be confronted with a debate on YouTube in which normal voters video questions and submit questions in order to send it to the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="4"> None of the questions that were raised at the Wednesday evening, the 28th November, were as ridiculous as the snowman was, the democrats' about the global warming in the YouTube Debatte of the other party questioned.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time the state of the republican party which opens into the choices in the next year exactly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It is not known, exactly as the producers of CNN, which supported the debate that clips selected the prospective candidate to YouTube to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Yet in the first half hour of the debate, the longest the a single topic was dedicated, immigration stood in the center.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The topic is one of the strongest topics for republicans.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The CNN asked a group to operate a dial from undecided voters if they heard things that they liked: The TV organization noticed tops of the approval than the candidates talked about the borders severely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner, and Romney which shifted itself forward in the decisive inquiries in Iowa and New Hampshire.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Giuliani attempts to shake off the call, it was soft with regard to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.</seg>
<seg id="12"> He attacked Romney in that it the former governor immigrants accused by Massachusetts, illegal for work at his house have prepared.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The two stopped especially hard than interrogators asked whether an "amnesty" (that would give illegal a regular status and the possibility onto the citizenship) would support to one of the candidates.</seg>
<seg id="14"> More insignificant candidates as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congress representative, and Tom Tancredo, a congress representative from Colorado, it succeeded with this topic nachzuhaken.</seg>
<seg id="15"> No one of the two men has serious chances during the nomination, but both stay in the running, maybe because they formerly and in a harder way beat onto the immigration bass drum as other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> To divide into the field of the immigration at least the candidates on the whole the same opinions: sharper borders, intolerance opposite illegal migrants.</seg>
<seg id="17"> This topic, together with fears about poisonous toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world, the differences help the republicans with forgetting or minimizing between liberals and Christian conservatives.</seg>
<seg id="18"> But the debate brought unequivocally problematic as other topics for the language.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Mr Giuliani was asked to, for which it supported arm restrictions in the past.</seg>
<seg id="20"> John McCain and Romney discussed about whether simulated drowning should be considered as torture.</seg>
<seg id="21"> One of the interrogators asked whether the candidatesbelieve every word of the Bible.</seg>
<seg id="22"> This resulted in Giuliani representing the point of view that although the Bible is his preferred book, it the history of Jonah and the whale maybe not literal believes.</seg>
<seg id="23"> A further interrogator asked whether Jesus would support the deathpenalty|capital punishment.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Mike Huckabee - now towards all expectations on the first place in an inquiry recently carried out in Iowa thanks to his Christian Konservativismus existing for a long time - it said that the death penalty is painful, but necessary.</seg>
<seg id="25"> When he was pushed on whether Jesus would approve it, he laughed at that and said Jesus was too intelligent in order to apply for a political office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The race remains unusually far open.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Huckabees rise in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls recent donation successes and his storms of applause in the debate of Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="28"> These two shot up from the nothingness, because the two wings of the party up to now not yet onto one of the better known and more traditional candidates of some could.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Per year in 1980 and 2000 a candidate united the party with a victorious message about the size of Americas and a winking to both wing of the party from the beginning and convincingly.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Pains of the Labour-party</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Gordon Brown discovered another further pit for the falling in; his way from this out stays the same one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> For British scandals this is not especially slippery.</seg>
<seg id="4"> No nobility titles seem to have been sucked sold any politician Paris hotel bills pays any extramarital toes.</seg>
<seg id="5"> However the exposure, that a rich businessman Spenden for the British ruling Labour party above more than 650.000 pounds (1.3 millions of dollars) more than four years under the name of other people disguised, and that the party failed to announce this, is something without that that one fought Gordon Brown good would have managed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When two months ago the Prime Minister had escaped from the demand for a choice, in stupid way the intelligence of the Britons offending when he said that opinion polls would not have influenced this decision there was hope that it would offer a robust, efficient government.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Instead of this as Vince Cable, the representation chairperson of the Liberal democrats astute in increasing measure, expressed it the at one time feared Brown of Stalin to Mr has itself. Bean developed.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The awkward rescue of Northern Rock, a hit bank, regulatorische weakness and bad discernment pointed under bombardment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Proposals badly thought over for the change of the tax laws set Unternehmensverbände against the government.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The tax-official loss of personal data of 25 million people showed inconceivable administrative botches.</seg>
<seg id="11"> A trio of generals retiredly started a revolt in the House of Lords from protest against shortenings of military editions: To be minister of the armed forces, so they claimed, a partial time job is.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labours secretary-general (and their former fulfillment conductor) already resigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Nothing of that means that Brown breaks direction resignationirrevocably open.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless governments can reach a turning point to which they feel impossibly to rule.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Neither like still people trust in politicians, nevertheless they restrain usually their skepticism if a new troop catches the office.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If it is once clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he needs not to be not even long in this case yet, this delay is past: the public service begins to become leaky; the cabinet ministers begin to chat; the press searches for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In a way the position of Brown is especially difficult because he can not say unlike other political leaders to be a new broom.</seg>
<seg id="18"> So with pleasure it Tony Blair would deny, he hisfirst lieutenant was.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The problems with Northern Rock and the tax responsibility documents, for example, love together with decisions that Brown made as a chancellor of the Exchequer.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And even if that one was not directly involved into Blair misfortunes - as to suffice at that one "money for nobility title" investigation of political party financing - the voters assume possibly that it was it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In spite of that situation is not very as bad to Browns as it looks</seg>
<seg id="22"> The misdemeanors are not as terrible as the conservatives describe it.</seg>
<seg id="23"> As at Mr. Bean, nobody died, or was entirely cheated.</seg>
<seg id="24"> And the antidote, painful as it likes to be, is to be delivered, which Browns always promised of course stalinistische tendencies: A reliable, sound one and slightly brutal government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The new fuss around political donations is a goodexample.</seg>
<seg id="26"> The garböske one Abraham's, who compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, he says wants no public recognition for his goodwill.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Maybe that likes to be like this, but he was not entitled to thedecision on that.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The laws against anonymity for tall political contributors are clear and they exist for an unequivocal reason: the public has to know a right to who access to those that rule over the country can be bought.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Watt, the says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, however not, that it is illegal, has to put as a matter of course some questions'; exactly as Jon Mendlesohn, Labours Hauptfinanzeintreiber, who was told about the strange donations in October.</seg>
<seg id="30"> However, up to now Brown is not shared: There is not anything, that it indicates that that he knew about this confusion although the biggest part of the payments was done after his office takeover in June.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Up to now the prime minister finished half of the work.</seg>
<seg id="32"> He condemned the injury of the laws fast through his party, but it diluted this determination by the reaching after a known instrument, an investigation committee on the topic - led by a bishop retiredly and a judge in order to make the measure full.</seg>
<seg id="33"> "In This Case" the "lessons to be drawn from that are not verycomplicated.</seg>
<seg id="34"> If the law was broken, it is a thing for the police.</seg>
<seg id="35"> Foreseen from that that one gives other things it Mr Brown must do, to find a permanent chairperson for the independent committee for standards in the public life that is vacant since six months as something, and to stride from political party financing ahead with a reform reaching through.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> That would require from the hardliners of the Labour to co-operate with the conservatives and to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions possibly - bitter pills for a party comrade as Mr Brown.</seg>
<seg id="37"> But it should be some biased facts conscious.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The conservatives have now a clear leadership in the opinion polls; it has to recover two years around voters; and the only way it can achieve a victory is through incontestable honesty and sound competence.</seg>

<seg id="11"> According to the rating agency Moody the Drittquartals-Säumnissrate of 3.89% was almost a full percent point under the historical average.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The deterioration with the rates can be explained partially by technical factors.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A change in the American private insolvency right laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case from bankruptcy registration that form in turn for a big part of the Keditkartenverluste; the number of the registration (and in this way delay fees) would go up again, whether the general conditions for applicants for the credit worsen or not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The industry reports also about sound payment rates which show how much of their debts the consumers pay off every month</seg>

<seg id="18"> The card exhibitors look, however, at the money river instead of onto capital values, therefore falling house prices do not activate of necessity a change in the creditworthiness of the applicant for the credit.</seg>
<seg id="19"> You can be even for the card exhibitors of advantage.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The stimuli for consumers, to keep on paying the mortgage rates, sink if the immovables are less value than the value of the loan; as a result the card debts become more important under the repayment priorities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Card exhibitors can react to the stormier conditions also much more quickly and more flexibly as credit grantors when they change interest rates or credit borders.</seg>

<seg id="2"> The stocks jumped yesterday on both pages of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the central bank will attempt to calm the credit markets through further reductions of the rate of interest through appeasing comments of the vicechairperson of the US were confirmed central bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The share markets increased in London, New York and in whole Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairperson of the central bank, said that the politics "flexibly and pragmatically" must react to the continuous pressure on the financial markets.</seg>

<seg id="1"> England confronted with decision on the statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Here two dilemmas, each of them in an almost just as difficult way asthe other one.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Who is supposed to beat as a number 6 for England into Kandy at this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?</seg>
<seg id="4"> And, not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is supposed to make the decision?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second question is important, because David Graveney, the choice chairperson, on call at least under this specific title, here is, around which to help Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan with deciding manager, and because the table of High Morries, the English managerial director, fills itself with applications for national voter offices by degrees, otherwise even for which ones in partial time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Whoever does not get the sixth brawler position will be unhappy, but the life is often unfair and the sport is it beyond doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7"> It is never simple to nail exactly what a human being facilitates to reach the top of his of Berufszweiges while somebody is differently never coming out about the lowest rank sometimes for lack of luck instead of ability.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It is not only in the cricket where the selection, where judgments which are always at the end subjective are necessary, is difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It is the correct time for Bopara climb up?</seg>
<seg id="10"> Is it fair to Shah if he does it?</seg>
<seg id="11"> That resembles can be asked maybe also in one further field, whether for example John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee should be conveyed, both intelligent young managers with good ends that know the business well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Who can say what the correct class is for a cricketer, unless, the possibility to swim or to sink is given to him.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As a matter of course numbers have a great influence on decisions, but chances also have this.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Within a team a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain to the correct time, if it can take a Wicket and a brawler must get regular chances on the order if it wants to do impression as a one-day cricketer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> To catch the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="16"> There were many which were better in the last season than, for example, as James Anderson, who will play seemingly in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares itself as healthy and bowls as the wind into the nets.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with each 33 runs in order to earn a position in this tour.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but they both had their highlights and hope for still more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Whether Shah or Bopara plays in the Asgiriya Stadium can be only an opinion question.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The choice could decide on the careers of both men, or nevertheless maybe it does little difference.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, it was, however, Paul Collingwood to consolidate then still fightingly around himself that created the breakthrough to a significant test cricketer and that, although it scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, maybe still is underestimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Probable is, that Graveney, Vaughan and bog, after a further discussion in the course of the present net meeting in the Asgiriya Stadium will follow their conservative instincts and stomach feeling for Shahs greater experience above Boparas youthful enthusiasm.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> There are arguments for both of them.</seg>
<seg id="24"> For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 Test-Debüt-Innings into Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara that is younger with 22 years seven years, and an excellent balance against rolling turned on.</seg>
<seg id="25"> But Shah did Indies only ten runs in his two Innings in the May against west in the test in lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate refusal of the selectors as Vaughan healthy was in order to take back his position for the next game it seems to have taken the swing that was still manifest in Bombay from his beating.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In Contrast the all-rounder has shovel-wise high spirits from Essex.</seg>
<seg id="27"> It is not impressed from anything on a cricket place and was brought his attitude off on the point, than he had estimated a vehicle with four wheel drive recently in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> He suffered smaller injuries and presumably a shock, but the First that he did was his Vodafone (natural also gesponsort) to get out and to call his team colleague Alastair Cook that had observed this from the distance, and to say his team colleague Alastair Cook that had observed this from the distance with enthusiasm: "You saw that"?.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Bopara is a much better field player, he bowls his central speed with some effect here on the grounds, what it seems to match to it and beats with confidence and fate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> To elect the correct man is a thing, to choose the correct time another.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Maybe that is the actual art of the selection.</seg>
<seg id="32"> I bend for this purpose his chance to give to Bopara now, what does not mean that nevertheless maybe Shah will not stand good if, suggested as the tea sentence from Ceylon, he is that one that will play here this weekend.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Some had even come back around the rebels combat, that had marketed it from their houses.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="6"> "I came today back, because of what I saw on televison and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and as it would be now secure."</seg>
<seg id="7"> You say that the Mahdi-army stopped killing people", he said, with respect to the Schiitenmilizen of the militant clergyman Moqtada Al-Sadr who ordered to put his strengths to the present time back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year old schiitischer teacher from the predominant one sunnitische part of Amariyah, with his two children turned, because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqi to work.</seg>
<seg id="9"> His schiitischen neighbors in Amariyah appealed to him in order to say to him that a militia local, supported by the USA helped to drive out Al-Qaida of their bastion in the west of the capital, and insisted it for the return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a sunnitischen and schiitischen tribe who had been driven out of his house by an attack with grenades in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad after who having been called his fellow citizens for the abatement Al-Qaidas.</seg>
<seg id="11"> He was to come back in order to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "Two days ago some of my friends called me and said to me, that they began one the Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and that of my boys.</seg>
<seg id="13"> That is why I returned today", Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62, said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Many told, that they had been attracted through the increasing rest in the capital since the US troop increase and the growth of local "groups affected citizen", which one arms and defend their quarters in collaboration with the American military.</seg>
<seg id="15"> However more spoke of that, to have been forced home through visa problems and versiegender resources in Damascus, where more than 1,3 million Iraqis had fled in the last years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year old three times father, expressed to force the general suspicion among the Exilanten that Nouri al-Maliki, the schiitische Prime Minister, had requested of the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions for the fugitives, around people for the return.</seg>
<seg id="17"> More than two and a half millions of people fled presumably from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "We were fine until al-Maliki Syria visited and" it said "the government was urgent not to give the Iraqis any visas more in order to force her for the return into Iraq" the sunnitischen pensioners'.</seg>
<seg id="19"> "I can not trust a government that supports the criminals, that my house burned down, after I went away."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A part of the reason for the drop of the power is that Sunniten were driven out of schiitischen residential areas, where tensions decreased, and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6"> So the colleges co-operate already from tradition withthe neighbor countries closely.</seg>

<seg id="9"> The part is correspondingly high foreign Studying with 15,6 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> However Saarland brings also the subjects onto the colleges in number above average - many of them without an end at the grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="11"> "In Saarland one uses the professional education system", Axel Plünnecke, education expert, says at the IW.</seg>
<seg id="12"> More than every fifth young person gains his study authorization at a vocational school, Saarland lies in this way more than seven percent points above the federal average.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Also the possible combinations of professional and academic training are comparably strongly built up.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The equipment with dual courses of studies is measured by the population number the second-best one in Germany.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In spite of the practical training and increasing demand the number of the engineer graduates in the last years, however, around a third sank.</seg>
<seg id="16"> For that the Saar education ministry obliged the colleges to a marketing campaign now for engineer-scientific compartments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "At the general education schools we initiated according to the first Pisa-study many reforms", a speaker of the education ministry says.</seg>
<seg id="18"> So the government introduced national benchmark tests.</seg>
<seg id="19"> In this way the children to begin formerly to learn is the last Kita year free of charge - a model that meanwhile also other federal states copy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> First future comparison studies will show whether the services of the pupils improve lastingly.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Near Pisa 2003 the part of the risk pupils of 29 on 20 percent shrank.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In total Saarland did not increase itself as strongly, however, as other federal states did.</seg>
<seg id="23"> The Bavarians calculate better.</seg>
<seg id="24"> And for the annoyance of the Saarlanders Fremdsprachenkenntnise are not measured near Pisa - in this field one could score otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Because the language of the neighbors is duty at grammar schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.</seg>

<seg id="4"> Now the European probe "Venus Express" produced the proof - she traced electro-magnetic waves on the fringe of the atmosphere: The flashes on the Venus fire in a height from cloud to cloud of about 56 kilometers, Christopher Russel of the University of California tells in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> According to the famous "Ursuppen-Theorie" flashes made the life arise on the earth: Thunderstorms are supposed to have stimulated in the ocean reactions that led to the education from amino acids the elements of the life.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Not so on the Venus: "If there were ever lives over there, it must have been in the very early history", Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution declares in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Today there might hardly be on the surface of the Venus something live: The atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on the earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="8"> "The Venus is maybe the devil twin of the earth, but she is a twin", Russel said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Why the Venus is, the the earth in mass and size so similar, a so entirely different development has struck, the Esa-Mission is the basic question.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus-research since since beginning of the nineties no probe anymore was especially on the way for the exploration of this planet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The newest research results, that "are imagined" now in several "Nature"-Artikeln, do not underline in the view of the researchers only the uniqueness of the Venus within the solar system.</seg>
<seg id="12"> "You also show that the common characteristics of our neighbor planet with the earth are greater than first of all accepted" the Esa informs.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The researchers found like this also a cloud whirlpool next to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole at the South Pole which turns still considerably more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The phenomenon reminds of airflows on the earthly winter hemisphere, a team of researchers writes around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The second-innermost planet of the solar system has the almost same mass as the earth does and is almost just as big with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="16"> The planet referred to also as a morning or evening star circles in just 225 days around the sun.</seg>
<seg id="17"> He turns itself much more slowly, however, around themselves: A Venus day lasts 243 earth days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees of centigrades and a pressure of 92 cash hardly reminds of the earth, scientists assume that both planets had arisen under very similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="19"> On both water that remained on the earth on which Venus, however, got lost into the space in oceans was collected.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And while carbon dioxide is being fixed on the earth in carbonate rocks, it defines the majority of the atmosphere on the Venus.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Germany's supergroup of the seventies plays music again: The three volume members of Harmonia planned their consoles once again at a concert in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="3"> To the Revival a monitoring appears from their large time"Live in 1974".</seg>
<seg id="4"> Already then it was abroad considerably more famous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The arranged sensation happens then in the form of three set gentlemen at the evening board.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Everyone has his box in front of themselves,his cables and particularly his buttons.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Dieter Möbius thrones in the blossom-white shirt with 63 years inthe middle.</seg>
<seg id="8"> To the left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in the possession of laptop and guitar.</seg>
<seg id="9"> To the right, considered from the auditory, bends Hans-Joachim Rödelius, 73, concentrated at the console.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Everyone contributes noises, sometimes even a Beat.</seg>
<seg id="11"> And sometimes it matches by mistake to a traditionalpiece of music.</seg>
<seg id="12"> That seems not to disturb also the gentlemen themselves then in a largeway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> That the band Harmonia plays music again worried among cabbage skirt lovers for some excitement.</seg>
<seg id="14"> At what here may reveal: Purposeful demands did not show that the name buzzed indeed through the collective pop memory, however, by no means so lastingly in order to miss this band painfully since 32 years.</seg>
<seg id="15"> But why is also the German not supposed to be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the Siebziger years?</seg>
<seg id="16"> Especially as what is called Krautrock misleadingly was valid always more in England and America than in the own country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> When the music economy awarded the survivors of the group of Can 2003 of Cologne with the reverberation-price for the life's work, one looked in the hall into asking German pop faces.</seg>
<seg id="18"> As the Red Hot chili Peppers in the eulogy also still near the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! thanked, the amazement did not know any borders.</seg>
<seg id="19"> In the case of concerts Michael Rother sat later with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage as an old pal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The problem of the ignorance at home and the transfiguration abroad isone.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The memory is already therefore overtaxed because the trio existed only two years and unfolded also a far smaller effect power in this time than they subsequently were assigned to by other with Harmonia.</seg>
<seg id="22"> Möbius and Rödelius had played music already before with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the name cluster promising a lot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> First of all one played in the cellar under the Berlinshow stage.</seg>
<seg id="24"> After that in Düsseldorf, for economical reasons for a plate label maintained by the church.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Rother had helped out shortly near power station and connecting oneself as a guitarist at Neu!, the then maybe most radical German group, a call erspielt.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Around 1973 Rother followed, however, the cluster-musicians into the exile after forest in the Weser mountain country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> There, in the Old Weser yard, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as city-fugitive Kommunarden.</seg>
<seg id="28"> Less ideological than in the commune I, where Rödelius was still allowed to take pains as a nurse.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Rather in spitzweghaftem artist existence.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Also a pennon of the song association Harmonia Ottenstein was found alleged in the bulky waste and for the art a name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Some held Harmonia of that.</seg>
<seg id="32"> "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe" was called thefirst album.</seg>
<seg id="33"> Because so calmly and modestly the music also rang, the band suffered from material need.</seg>
<seg id="34"> The brushwood compiling was not used only for the Selbstfindung.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The now appeared CD "Live in 1974" was logged at a concert in Griessem, before a just 50-headed record scenery, how anyone to remember believes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The wish came of Rother then, Harmonia to force and to practice sometimes.</seg>

<seg id="62"> Who here "'68!" calls, does not have very improperly, and Harmonia can not be brought from that also now from the rest.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous peace" two films deal again with Balkan War.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Nevertheless both do not convince.</seg>
<seg id="4"> To set the drafts either to a lot on Action and Geballer or however they are too sentimental.</seg>
<seg id="5"> There also Richard Gere can not help in "The Hunting Party".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The good information first: Indeed the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic hide still in the mountains of the Balkans, however, calculated there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere was found now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> We had last lost the most beautiful man of the octogenarian years from the eyes because far too many nice-irrelevant roles cured one of the pleasure into feeling well motion-picture work for women and far too many press conferences on the topic Buddhism on seeing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting party - When the hunter to the Is Hunted (why film titles must be today actually always so long and confused as train driver wage agreements must?) nevertheless maybe to look.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It supplies a representation eye-winking wonderfully: Basically his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become from Gere if the fate and the film branch were not so merciful: A man who has his very best times long behind himself, who, however, still preserved considerable residues of the former charm even as a ruin-same monument of his downfall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But in spite of this trump "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Murderous peace", that starts also in this week, only the endless row of failed Balkan War films.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> With "Murderous peace" one can do short process: The film acts from two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serb from kosovarischen snipers, on which one falls with them in love promptly also still.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Although it is acclaimable, that here once not the Serbs as an only root of all evil are represented, the fernsehflache film disappears far too quickly in Geballer and Action.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A kind remains "Alarm for Cobra 11" without motorway but for thatwith war.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> On the other hand it can be investigated at "The Hunting Party" almost exemplarily why actually there has never yet been a correctly good Balkans war film.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The history of three US war reporters that prepare themselves in order to trace the Serbian upper war criminal "the fox" could have become maybe a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another scriptwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard) at another time.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Because the stories resemble themselves really remarkably: To go both Male small teams into the forest, in order to achieve something, what the militaries not can and both Male it becomes a journey into the madness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is, that one of Simon Hunt not simple the cynic come down with heart be lets, when that it us at the beginning is imagined.</seg>
<seg id="18"> No, the script must impute on top of that still a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Finally "The Hunting Party" goes then the creek under that, if the reporters succeed in what Nato, CIA and all head money hunters of the world in five years did not create within the last five minutes in the quick-motion procedure: The war criminal catch and to the Muslim Bosnians for the just revenge leave.</seg>
<seg id="20"> That is so bad that one would like to call the International court of justice in The Hague because of crimes against the cinema logic.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="21"> In this case the film has a most deeply human request.</seg>
<seg id="22"> He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic run still freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to be by way of exception once agreed) not to practice the pursuit far too intensely due to secret political agreements.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But the well-meant one and the evil are sometimes so similar themselves that a famous Brecht-Gedicht comes to one into the sense.</seg>
<seg id="24"> In that it is called above the wooden mask of an Asiatic demon on the workbench of the poet: "I see the swollen forehead veins compassionate, pointing out: hard how being bad is".</seg>
<seg id="25"> Films as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such a swelling-head that, however, pointing out is as hard, good to be.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="26"> The problem is not restricted on the genre of the Balkan Warfilm.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Is recent in this newspaper tells become, that all Iraq films Hollywoods were big flops.</seg>

<seg id="29"> Almost always is valid: If a star hangs around on the crisis-breeding elements or mine fields of the world, something like that comes in this case then from that as "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Possibly all the conflicts are within a given time simply still toonear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> It had to pass by after all decades before to Hollywood with "Schindlers Liste" could shoot a good film about the holocaust.</seg>
<seg id="32"> Some film will presumably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" being regarded as classics now were not celebrated at that time really by any means as masterpieces unanimous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> But maybe we know today, where every mass murder in real time comes on now two screens at home, also simply too much about the conflicts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="34"> And that robs the screenplay writers of the Bedenkenlosigkeit who needs it in order to tell good histories.</seg>

<seg id="1"> From Beust criticism gathers for Olympic-refusal</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The moving away of the mayor of the application of Hamburg for Olympic Summer Games bumped with politics and economy onto vehement criticism.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Many keep on wanting to fight for the games at the water.</seg>
<seg id="4"> However from Beust realism sends a reminder with|in the caseof the assessment of the chances.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The main manager of the Hamburg chamber of commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described on Wednesday a renunciation when "not good for the economic location".</seg>
<seg id="6"> No other project developed in recent time so great motivation strengths in the city as the Olympic idea did.</seg>
<seg id="7"> "Without this objective the sport-political swing could not be maintained in the same measure."</seg>
<seg id="8"> Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate "which takes a changed time ray as a basis" not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach for that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Mayor Ole of Beust stayed on Wednesday with former statements according to which at least the Olympic aspirations of Hamburg are unrealistic up to the year 2028.</seg>
<seg id="10"> "Not Hamburg decides about an Olympic application, but the German Olympic" sport Federal Government", said from Beust WELT ONLINE.</seg>
<seg id="11"> He referred to the decision of the sport Federal Government about an application of Munich for the winter games 2018 expected for beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="12"> "This preference means for us that we will not have any realistic chances in the period up to now thought by us to 2028."</seg>
<seg id="13"> Nevertheless the dream is not for all time dream, said from Beust.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Hamburg sport Federal Government (HSB) regrettedthe statements of Beusts.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The impression that Hamburg does not want to apply in the next 25 years anymore for Olympic Games is given by that.</seg>
<seg id="16"> It is too early to obstruct a chance when one the plans buried already to this time", HSB president of Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> A renunciation of the application stands furthermore contrary to the statement of the senate leader on the occasion of a reception to the plenary session of the General German College Port Association.</seg>
<seg id="18"> There from Beust the application of Hamburg for the Universiade 2015 did not describe as substitute" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The college port association had nominated as an applicant city only in the last week Hamburg.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The SPD citizens faction reproached the senate not to have used valuable time for the house building in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="21"> "The Development of the Small Grasbrooks was delayed by the senate for years because he put Olympia on the card and "ignored" the house building", the SPD-representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.</seg>
<seg id="22"> While the SPD was always demanding an integrated planning for the Kleinen Grasbrook for Olympia and a later living-use, the CDU put on one side on the "event-factor".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The Application for the Olympic Summer Games 2012 had activated a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at that time.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Leipzig had defeated, however, Hamburg.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Those ones are not Warhols boxes</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Who combines the concepts of Swedes and Holzkiste thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Or nevertheless?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Currently dark shadows fling work list into wooden boxes produced to Swedes on Warhols.</seg>
<seg id="5"> A majority of the ninety-four there listed Brillo-boxes of the "type Stockholm" are forgeries.</seg>
<seg id="6"> After the Swedish newspaper stirred up Expressen some months ago doubts about the genuineness of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes of the year 1968, internal enquiries come in the Moderna Museet into Stockholm now for a sobering result: The six "Brillo-Boxes" that the former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed to the Moderna Museet in 1995 as donation are copies - and presumably also the majority of the about a hundred more Brillo boxes of the "Typ Stockholm" that are on the international art market in circulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The case history is encapsulated, a confusing concatenation of artistic and kuratorischer productions.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In 1964 Warhol got his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes which are based on the red-blau-weissen design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo", into New York.</seg>
<seg id="9"> An exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet 1968 exhibited hundreds of Brillo-boxes - with Warhols consent - of cardboard: These did not come (from Kostengründen) from Warhol, but they were delivered directly from the Brillo board mill.</seg>
<seg id="10"> It was a question not of works of art, but of their models, around bare exhibits.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Simultaneously Warhol gave in 1968 presumably the permission to make of a few Brillo wooden boxes which, however, were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet be produced in Sweden.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Time witnesses speak now of about fifteen boxes which then shrank as authorized Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the denomination "Typ Stockholm" to right into the art and auction history.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Some of them achieved more than 100 000 dollars on auctions.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén claimed later by mistake, it is in 1968 produced about a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden that Warhol left to him then and exhibited.</seg>
<seg id="15"> In fact Hulténs 105 boxes were produced only in 1990 in Malmoe for an exhibition in hr. Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="16"> To this time Warhol was already three years dead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Lars Bystroem, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, examined next to that one six museum-own Brillo-Boxes also three from Swedish private property, of which two 1968 in Stockholm were made: Your pressboard plates were primed first and ground off, after that white oil paint with a paintbrush was put on.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The structure of the copies from the year 1990 on the other hand betrays that the color with a painter role without undercoat was applied directly to the pressboard plate - in addition it is not a question around Oil-, but around acrylic color.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> "These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes by the official list", the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve lets announce: "When the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication' comes board' in New York not to another end, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in his collection as copy/exhibition material.</seg>
<seg id="20"> Already in July certainly the Authentication Board announced to follow the "difficult accusations" that are raised as regards the soap powder boxes.</seg>
<seg id="21"> However, since then one wraps oneself in relentless silence there.</seg>
