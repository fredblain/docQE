In the budaoerser, the price of the usual Christmas "napi" also this year around 16% were increased, but in all price increases of more registered.
After the prices in the food markets last December "," the price increase not out to be drastic, compared with the previous already high level.
However, it has an effect on consumers certainly as a deterrent that that is what they are, in the last year still far below paid hoof, not even for 10,000 this year is available.
The price of the "napi" basket crossed the by at least 91 hoof studied in the markets.
The highest price amounted hoof.
(the price, at 6.800.)
The prices for unicum and live fish almost remained on previous, have, on the other hand the prices for nut and poppy.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, there were cut, however, for forint 139.
There was no mention product limited price slump with less than 200 forint.
This is also what the price of a stroke of under two Coca-Cola 200 forint, thus the drink cost including pledge only in 257.
Nevertheless, this year in the "napi" at the most expensive and at best.
Our calculations indicate that the prices in the "napi" market basket vis-à-vis the Christmas prices in the last year, while Tesco around 15 and 18% cut in each case raises.
The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive of this year amounted to 12%, while the increase between market basket of last year and this year formed of 21%.
The average price rise, 1.480,00.
The average increase in prices was still at 1,206.00 last year, however, the tax increase in prices to apparent last Christmas.
Just this process found the trade badly: seemingly the department stores could not decide so right which price margin they should use in the individual articles, because the effects of the increase in prices for the consumer, unpredictable.
(if the vendor is on the rotation speed of a product badly, it can fall around essential profits in the price margin that follows the undertaken.)
The price increase of the "napi" turned out in the last year so radically, that the most expensive basket the value of 2006 about 1720 exceeded, whereas the difference in prices at the cheapest basket only 844 forint was.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost about 1.630,00 forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a rise in prices of 1,284.00.
In the comparison of the two last Christmas showed a catastrophic increase in prices, the price of the daily consumer items on the in less than 20 months for more than 30% per year.
(this is not necessarily confirmed the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, with some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months a more than a price increase.
So in about beside flour also with eggs.)
However, one looked into the "napi" market basket, this seems almost impossible with the latter, because the price of the product already in the previous year even in the worst case for little more than 10 per cent.
Obviously are in a stronger position than the egg - after all they could the drastic increase in prices to the multis shift.
In the golden the hypermarkets do not complain, constantly about good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores does not look at the prices more.
From all large quantities are bought, lasting foods go in over the counters.
Wednesday morning, all three department stores endless with the cash when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country is a smaller customer frequency reports, so that many multis deplore themselves with the, they could not achieve even the planned turnover, and not just with food, but also with lasting consumer goods.
