Richard is simply not cynical enough
With "the party" and "murderous peace" two films deal again with Balkan war.
But both do not.
Either the concepts set too much on action and geballer or however they are too sentimental.
There also Richard in "the hunting party did not help.
The good news first, while the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic hide still in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the dark hinterland of, now the actors, Richard have found again.
We had the most beautiful man in the last years from the eyes, because in all too many kind unimportant roles for women and all too many press conferences drove Buddhism is the desire to issue a on seeing.
Now, Richard suddenly the most important argument, "the party - when the hunter to the will gejagten (why must be today actually always so long and confused as train them, perhaps, but?).
It provides a perfect representation: after his Simon what could have become from, if the fate and the reporter were not so benevolent: a man, of its very best times has long behind it but himself as a monument his decline is preserved considerable residues of the former charm.
But in spite of this, "the hunting party" together with the German production "murderous peace" starts also in this week, only the endless series of failed continues.
With "murderous peace" one can do short process: the film acts of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian topol, Max riemelt), from save from Kosovo, on which a swiftly, her falls in love.
Although it is not that once an only Serbs as the root of all evil are represented, the film is far too quickly in geballer and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for 11" without motorway but for with war.
On the other hand it can turn to "the party" almost exemplary, why it did not was never yet a correctly good Balkans.
The history of three, to open up the Serbian "the fox to trace with" would have another director and another (both in personnel Union Richard shepard) at another time perhaps a new ‘ Apocalypse Now ".
Because the stories are alike yes: go both male small teams in the forest, in order to achieve something which the soldiers and not can both male it becomes a journey into the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "the party" is that it is not simply the Simon descended cynic with heart when he presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script, and it still a romantic affair with a Bosnian murdered later.
Finally "the hunting party" go then the brook down, if the reporters within the last five minutes in the CIA succeed in what NATO, and all of the world in five years: the war criminal catch and the Muslim Bosnians for the just revenge.
That is so bad that the International Court of Justice in The Hague because of crimes against the wishes to call.
The film has a deeply human concerns.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to be by way of exception once agreed) pursuit due to secret political arrangements so intensively.
But the well-meant one and the evil are sometimes so similar to that a famous comes into the sense.
In that it is called on the wooden of Asian demon on the workbench of the poet: "I see the swollen front forehead: how hard it is to be bad".
Films as "the party" have exactly such swelling heads, however suggest how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the category of the limited.
Recent newspaper reports is that all Iraq films were big flops.
One can add: there has never been a good South.
Almost always applies: if a star on the elements or mine fields of the world, then something comes out of it as "Rangoon" with Patricia arquette beyond all borders, "or" blood diamonds "with" with Leonardo dicaprio.
Possibly all the conflicts within a given time simply still too.
It is, after all, decades ought to pass before Hollywood with "Schindler's list" shoot a good film about the Holocaust.
Some film will presumably still mature - as classics now geltenden "the", "Apocalypse Now" or "full metal at that time really" are not celebrated as masterpieces unanimous.
But maybe we know today, where every mass murder in real time comes on now two screens at home, also simply too much about the conflicts in the world.
And that robs the screenplay writers, which it needs in order to tell good histories.
"existence or the" or "yes" big dictator are finally therefore as well as well, because lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet how badly the Nazi regime really prevailed.
Perhaps one may not want to be good if one wants to make good films.
Perhaps the artist look of the Lawrence Norfolk.
As the parallels between his historical novel "lemprières dictionary" and Balkan war was questioned, he replied: "that is only because some things never change.
Cities are always terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in dreadful way and always there will be war in Yugoslavia. "
