That is not warhols boxes
Who the concepts Sweden and wood thinks Ikea, but not at Andy in.
Or?
In Sweden now take a dark shadow over warhols.
A large part of the listed there of the "Stockholm" are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "expresses some months ago about the genuineness of Andy warhols of companies in 1968, internal investigations come in in in the Stockholm now for a result: the six boxes", "former of Museum in 1995 as the the donation has bequeathed are copies - and probably the majority of the about a hundred more of the", "the Stockholm on the international art market in circulation.
The case history is encapsulated, a confusing artistic and kuratorischer productions.
In 1964, created in New York his first boxes "," the painted wooden on the design of the cardboard boxes of the soap "brillo".
An exhibition of his work in 1968 in the thought - with warhols agreement - hundreds of brillo cardboard: these (derived from cost reasons), but they were not, directly from the brillo board mill.
It was not a question of works of art, but their models to mere exhibits.
At the same time, in 1968 presumably the permission of a few brillo wooden produce in Sweden, but not in the in the were switched off.
Time witnesses speak now of about fifteen boxes which then as authorized original-andy-warhol-brillo-boxes with the names "Stockholm" to right in the art and auction history.
Some of them are more than 100 000 dollars on auctions escalation.
The problem is now that the legendary director of Museum has claimed later by mistake, it is about a hundred 1968 boxes in Sweden was produced and issued left to him then.
Indeed, only in 1990 105 boxes for an exhibition in PC St. Petersburg.
It was already three years dead.
Lars bystroem, on in the curator, along with the six museum boxes even three from Swedish private property, of which two 1968 in Stockholm were made: your pressboard plates were first and ground after, that, with a white laid on.
The structure of the copies from the year 1990, on the other hand betrays that the without with a coat directly on the laid on it - it was not a question of oil, but also about color.
"these boxes were not autorisiert from artists and from the official list of Andy warhols" can be removed, the director of the Lars in, announce: "when the 'Andy in kind board' in New York not to another, the conclusion will in the six boxes in his collection as copies / classify."
Already in July certainly the authentication board announced the ", the" serious accusations being on the soap powder boxes are raised.
But since then, one in relentless there.
