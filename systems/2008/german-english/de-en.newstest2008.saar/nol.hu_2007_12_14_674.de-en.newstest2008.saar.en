Political capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk
In the view of the Department of risk analysis (risk division) of political capital in the activities of this August with support from the "movement for a better Hungary" Hungarian created guard the risk of Hungary and the region in several respect.
In the "risk" of the institute does among other things: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk sets the "intensification of already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and in Hungary, even in the short term, which could lead to violent ethnic quarrels."
The main reason is the Hungarian guard, probably at the provocation of such a confrontation, for example at the research institute.
How reports, this is a failure on the part of the politically responsible considered: "public discussion of have with representatives of radical political grouping, who are now based their political strategy on the".
One presumes that the problem, the reasonable dialogue impossible extremities favour, as well as the probability of violent quarrels would increase.
The forschungsinsitut means the activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad substantially, particularly in confidence in the stability and democratic maturity is concerned."
We remember: since fall 2006 the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary is accelerating, so that since summer 2007 several association, "national" naming organizations were established.
"these groups is that in each case define as a civil organization, while they are boasting about that openly their members on - sometimes armed - tasks, preparing (disaster protection, national Defense), with reference to the unsuitability of the police, the army or the State itself," called it.
Further, and this in accordance with that method which is focused on the political and various moroseness of the population based, political efforts as civil initiative to camouflage.
The emphasis on civilian character and the association not merely serve the avoidance of legal hurdles in the course of the registration in court could emerge - it is also a political strategy.
What is to be understood from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian guard a risk factor for the relations with the States.
In recent months, the Hungarian guard in several States as a potential source of surveys, for politician of certain countries sees in the origin of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own.
All this has effects on the political stability of the region - it was called ".
From the point of view of the research institute the creation of the Hungarian guard no in, thus the political risk increased for the entire region.
As reports, the activities of the Hungarian guard comparable with those of the Bulgarian national guard, in the creation of the Bulgarian's National Union (bnu) was announced.
In the background of the Bulgarian guard were in a mass of Sofia quarters (krasna poljana) stood.
The bnu took as an opportunity the incidents for the establishment of the national guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization of the "national protection".
In their view, is the last 17 years a regular "palpable" in Bulgaria, the State remained, however, idle and indifferent - so political capital.
And further: the initiative would have a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public kicked loose.
As said that the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard.
There the activities of the Hungarian guard up to now many similarities with those of the Bulgarian national guard shows, not to exclude it is that the Hungarian Roma also with the organization of their own protection to react to the threats that it is called in the risk of political capital.
Attila juh√°sz, research with political capital said on request of the report: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis published, and should is visible tendencies, the public opinion is informed, as in the case with the publication of the risk.
