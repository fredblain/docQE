Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are dealt with by law, so that the procedure for the reorganization of the work days around the holidays has now been established, but the coming year little such days.
Also in the EU and in America one means something different by "holiday".
The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and days.
Work free days are usually ecclesiastical holidays or are related with significant historical events.
We celebrate for example also new year: both the last day of the old, as also the first day of the new year, free days - for the latter to rest.
Throughout the year, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state of 15 March are at the revolution of 1848, and 23 October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August the establishment of state, on 1 May the work celebrated on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead.
In addition there are the two holidays to Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
As our Heads of State or religious holidays rare on a weekend fall, the practice of the "" proved itself in the cases in which we before or after the holiday only a day would work.
The price of the prolonged weekends, however, is that we are very probably work on Saturdays before it, or must go to school.
When that day before or after the holiday should be processed last finally, since long years by the Employment Minister in its own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and takers for public employees and civil servants of the public service.
Only companies and facilities are excluded, in which the company without interruption, also at the holidays, is continued.
This only rules by holidays at the end of the year are damaged: from the 24th December remains life positively in this country as most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the holidays, particularly for it waived.
Next year more holidays fall into the, and at the end of the week at the working days, so that there will be less than this year.
First the calendar is around the day of the work on the head ", so that the people of four days now at can stay at home.
Saturday, the 26 April will be a working day, thereby Friday, 2 May can be a day of rest.
The second change of plans is connected with the holiday on 23 October, on Saturday, the 18 October will be process Friday, 24 October first.
The end of the year will however be in the indication of the holidays, after all, from the 24th December and, if New Year's Eve, even on a Wednesday.
