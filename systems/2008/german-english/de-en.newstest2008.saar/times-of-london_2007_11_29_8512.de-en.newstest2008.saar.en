England confronted with decision on the statements of owais Shah and
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the others.
Who as number 6 for England in kandy at this weekend, owais Shah, or ravi?
And, not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is supposed to make the decision?
The second question is important, because the David youthful, on call at least under this specific title, here is the Peter bog and captain Michael Vaughan to help to determine and because the table of high morries, the English gradually managing director, with applications for national voter pews when not even for which in partial time.
Whoever does not get the sixth will be unfortunate, but the life is often unfair and the sport, it is beyond doubt.
It is never easy to nail exactly what a human being to reach the top of his while someone else about the lowest rank sometimes for lack of luck instead of capacity.
It is not only in the cricket where it is needed, where difficult judgments are always at the end subjective.
It is the correct time for, from?
It is fair to Shah if he does it?
The same can, in a further area may also be asked whether, for example, John Edward "or", both intelligent young managers with good ends, know the business well should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class for a one-day, unless, he will have the possibility to swim or to go down.
As a matter of course numbers have a great influence on decisions, but also have this chance.
Within a team a one-day must the eye of the captain at the right time, start if he can take a wicket and a regular opportunities must be in order, if he wants to do impression as a one-day.
The eyes of the catch is too complicated.
There were many who better in the last season than, for example, as James Anderson, seemingly in the first test will play, even if Stephen pronounces itself and for known as the wind into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with each 33 runs in order to earn a position in this tour.
Chris tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but they both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or, in the asgiriya stadium, can only play a question.
The choice could decide on the careers of both men, or, perhaps, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka played Gareth batty in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, it was, however, Paul, then still fightingly, in order to consolidate the break-through to an important testkricketspieler abolished and that, although it is a double hundred against Australia in Australia, perhaps still is underestimated.
It is probable that youthful Vaughan and bog, after a further discussion in the course of today's in the asgiriya stage their conservative instincts and for shahs greater experience about net enthusiasm will follow.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds, and only six of the seven years younger with 22 years, and an excellent balance against bullets.
But Shah made only ten runs in its two innings in the may against West in the test in Lord, its as a player from middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the devices as Vaughan was known for his position for the next game, the momentum from its defeat seems to have taken the was still manifest in Bombay.
In contrast, the Jack of all trades from Essex Essex.
He has nothing to a impressed and its attitude off of it was perhaps when he recently with a vehicle in an exhibition for England sponsor Volkswagen had estimated.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was his Vodafone (, of course, also gesponsort) to get out and ask its Cook, which had observed this from the distance, and eagerly to say: "You saw that did?".
, is a much better, he his here with some impact on the grounds, what it seems to match and tolls with confidence and fate.
The right man to vote is one thing, to choose the correct time another.
Perhaps that is the actual art of choice.
I now its opportunity for this purpose, which does not mean that Shah well, but perhaps not chef if, as the from Ceylon suggests, it is that that will play here this weekend.
