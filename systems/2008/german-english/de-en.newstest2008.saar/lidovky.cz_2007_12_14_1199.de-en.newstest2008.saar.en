Budget is through
Yes, it is created.
The national budget is approved.
What is special one at this budget?
It is the first budget which this government projected, and without the support of opposition was accepted.
For the current year still with the ssd (social democrats), because it ministers endorsed (of this party) had submitted, and it therefore could not allow to refuse it.
Unlike the lively debate in front of the vote on the motion of no against the government nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Parliament approved have noticed, yet this is highly important law calmly.
This is, as it were, the paradox here.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the budget, whether one likes or not.
The budget is an essential component of the policy, however covered by the power of the government and the opposition.
This is a topic for the media, and therefore they dedicate more attention to it.
A quarrel among politicians is much more interesting for the public as a sober numbers.
The national budgets suffered from the last social democratic governments under three weak points that the budget for the year 2008 at the same time eliminate not:
The first is the high proportion of spending, because of law obliging, at which it does not only concern the pensions, but also to the spending the "implicit" coalition of ssd and ksm (Communists) in the last year before the choices.
The second is the fiscal account as a consequence of the first.
The third restriction consists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the deficits of the municipalities.
The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and eingermassen under control.
A real time bomb is, however, the budget deficit of the Communities.
Many mayors gave in order to save incomes from taxes, and bank credits further sources for investments, often mostly from financing through which they caused their city halls in the excess.
In recent years, enabling them, these debts by massive sales of stocks of energy and other supply networks, in which they had received from the State to pay off.
Now this source has already dried up.
As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy for some years, as the rest of the world, a growth through, whose incessantly boasts about ran the.
That represented a unique possibility for their governments, public finances in order.
Instead, the state of these governments were, however, still more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have much more reasonable than our Republic.
That is a giant disgrace which mainly be ascribed to the former governments.
We belong to the countries in the global scale, seen the least of poverty are threatened.
This is not, unfortunately, social nassiven needed just in the last years very in gigantic extent was blown up.
Even if it is able, a part of the unreasonable populist spending, which were adopted this year before the elections, altogether, if it is clear that soon lead to a shift of the pension entry age and come to a reform, then virtually any policy in this country, and, very quickly, who is in power, he will not have anything as a pure administration.
It is only easily exaggerated if it is, then, that existing officials from politicians, who are the largest part of the tax revenues mechanically on pensions and social.
Therefore the this year's budget can not be a revolution, but it can only the expulsion of normal outputs by duty.
The deficit intended for 2008 of 70 billion Crowns would be quite superfluous if former governments in the last ten years have not spent, which only worked.
If we do not want that in fact it results in that, at verwaltungsbeamte from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this strong coalition government too, that it is conscious that the state can issue only as much as he taxes and fees is able to take rest during the preparation of further wish.
Only these facilitate a gradual enforcement of a balanced budgets.
