The climate on the Venus might be a view on the future of the earth reveal
The Venus was maybe once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data on European contained an orbit show that the planet Earth a twin resembles more aware than hitherto.
Venus is the sewing Estonian planetary earth.
The two worlds have roughly the same size and have similar planet courses, however the Venus of the sun is a little closer.
Before billions of years would have been there on the Venus' conditions, very similar to those on earth would have been and could have been even inhabitable scientists believe today.
But because of the erosion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower's Venus, a quite different one.
Today the planet of water is robbed and has a surface temperature which is enough, lead to melt and ravaged by and flash storms.
The findings of the space probe Venus express the European space travel agency, which planned for one year examined, offer a view of how the earth in view of the catastrophic climatic changes could develop.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department physics at the Oxford University, one of the scale of the Venus express mission, said: "It is clear why the climate on the Venus so different to that of the earth, while the planet are being quite similar."
"our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which the Venus before billions of years as the earth has begun, possibly with a environment."
