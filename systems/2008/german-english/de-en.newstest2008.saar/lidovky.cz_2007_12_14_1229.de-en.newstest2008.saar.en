According to Klaus not only the structure of the conference that forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of non-government organizations, but also of the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it, and the reality.
"the debate there is unstructured, it is some word fireworks that only substitute for a real solution of current problems" said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed during the idea of his book that his issue is very important for it, and that he commits itself to that so therefore.
He also expressed its satisfaction over the fact that his book appears in German translation because "I often at the caricatures of my views."

Klaus reminded that it was not klimatologe, but it has in his opinion sufficient conditions in order to write such a book.
It is finally academics, able to understand professional discussions and to judge, has experience with statistics and is also.
As a main statement of the book he referred to the thesis that the climate is changed continuously and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no to global warming matching opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and, therefore, no threat represented and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate, superfluous, ineffective expensive and.
In addition he considers it as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian, unacceptable opinions on other ones, to impose he regards that as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
At present, when he said that he is not against "a reasonable environmental protection, however against militant who take no consideration on the relationship between expenditure and profit."
