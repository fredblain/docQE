Everything still open
Memo romey said, it does not consider worthy of a presidential candidate from a to be consulted.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency, ultimately, willing to place itself to a debate on the questions, in ordinary voters video questions and hand in order to send it to the candidate.
None of the questions that on the Wednesday evening, the 28 November, were raised, as ridiculous as the snowman the democrats, about the global warming in the debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time is the state of the Republican Party which opens in the elections next year is open.
It is not known, just as the producers of CNN, the debate, the selected the candidates to selected the beginning.
Yet in the first half hour of debate, the longest the a single issue was dedicated, immigration stood in the heart.
The issue is one of the strongest topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked to manipulate a group of voters to operate a if they heard things that they liked: the television noticed points of the agreement as the candidates talked about the borders severely.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner, and romney of in the decisive inquiries in Hampshire and new pushed forward.
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call that he was soft with regard to illegal immigration, when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked romney in that it the former governor of Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for working on its House.
The two stopped especially hard as interrogators asked whether one of the candidates a "Amnesty" (illegal a regular status and the way to the citizen would be) would support.
More insignificant candidates as Duncan hunter, a representative, and Tom tancredo, a representative from Colorado, in with this topic.
Neither of the two men have serious chance during the nomination, but both stay in the running, maybe because sooner and harder than others on the immigration bass drum.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates and the same opinions: sharper borders, intolerance illegal migrants.
This issue, together with fears about poisonous toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world to help the republicans differences between the liberal Conservatives and Christian or to minimize the least.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other topics for the language.
Mr Giuliani was asked, why he supported in the past.
John McCain and romney discussed about whether drowning should be regarded as torture.
One of the interrogators asked whether the candidates every word of the Bible.
This Giuliani representing the point of view that although the Bible is his preferred book, it the history of jonah and perhaps literally did not believe the whale.
A further question regulator asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
MIKE huckabee - now towards all expectations in the first place in an inquiry recently carried out in thanks to his Christian conservatism existing for a long time - said that the death penalty is painful, but necessary.
When he was pushed on whether Jesus would approve it, he said about Jesus was too intelligent in order to apply for a political office.
The racing remains open extraordinarily.
Huckabees rise in comes together with Paul's recent and its in the debate of Wednesday.
These two are out of nothing, because the two wings of the party up to now not yet on one of the better known and more traditional candidates of some could.
In 1980 and 2000 a candidate from the beginning and convincing together with a victorious message about the size of America and a to both wing of the party.
This time the party divided, and the result is not at all clear.
