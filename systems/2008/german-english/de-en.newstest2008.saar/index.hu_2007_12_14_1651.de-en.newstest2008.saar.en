In many places saving
This year more than a thousand infections in hospitals that due to inappropriate handling antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of personnel - factors, that the embankment of the infections are not just benign so the leading doctor of the national.
In many cases also near the saving.
In the traumatology-department of the to hospital a mrsa-infection was diagnosed recently.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient, after a serious accident to the hospital.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person of a hard car accident was released from the hospital, the man had little later return, however, with a mrsa-infection an important because of the operation, since that is still in the body of patients, not yet carried out.
Until 10 December of this year from hospitals activated by pathogens infections scale to the national nosocomialis surveillance system, so the leading doctor of the national,.
So many activated by scale, pathogens infections were registered in the hospitals therefore with security, may be higher in the darkness.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were against by the methicillin-oxacillin of resistant staphylococcus unnecessarily.
The staphylococcus (SA) bacterium bears about a third of the people in their nose without its causing an illness.
SA limited infections (as inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) react mostly well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
The means are however measured out too high or used, arise from the well respondierenden antibiotics resistant bacteria under appropriate conditions spread out in the hospitals quickly.
In the case of patients with badly or permanently immune systems, but also in older, or patients with small body weight can these bacteria difficult infections, such as or wound poisoning, therefore, cause.
The scale of the medical according to hospital is nothing special, such occurrences life.
One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte a - there are not only there, where it is not searched.
Resistant to antibiotics
"such patients are isolated, the nursing staff bears rubber and masks the supply, and we have the antibiotics, necessary for the treatment of" - so.
With their admission into the hospital to the patients to be examined, not always an infection can be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of initiated by infections in hospitals would be avoidable, however the currently prevailing conditions and conditions for the checking of stemming the origin or the spread of the virus, says.
After this infection mainly in hospitals and homes for the elderly, the taken patients should examine and mrsa-infected immediately isolate.
In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not quite so often.
Last but not least because it sides of the national health no subsidies for this investigation.
Most cases would not come to light before then therefore if anybody has a noticeable, according to the medical head of the epidemiology Center.
In addition, the European Union, there are strict recommendations regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there is, however, also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures.
Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be precise, that is, microbiological studies are necessary, so that no resistance to the means, however, that this directive is not always kept by hospitals either.
Under the or in the basic contained patient microbiological sampling are even more scarce, however.
In the case of the saving will
Scientific evidence proves that to patients with one of the most widely on the other is transmitted by nursing staff.
So the manual washing, or carrying gloves and masks a great importance, however, there are also in this area considerable shortcomings in the hospitals.
To is transmitted through droplet infection or contact in the indigenous hospitals, it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often full the beds connected barely even epidemiological view between them from a distance of at least 1.5 meters should be.
As karolina keep saying, it happens unfortunately in the financially less well set hospitals even that near saved, there are few nurses, many patients - factors, which almost favour the emergence of infections.
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there or the further spread of the virus can be stopped where these protective measures are followed, however.
Against to government Program
In handle causes enormous costs for the health insurance, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example the prevention of, or to their containment held in the government program.
After the first signs is successful - as published data prove, the tendency of the declining in England.
The European heart for illness prevention (ECDC), the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant (including), as well as to the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
