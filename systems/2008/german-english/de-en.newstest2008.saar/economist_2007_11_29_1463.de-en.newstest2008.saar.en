The labour pains
Gordon Brown has yet another pit for falling; its way from this remains the same.
For British scandals this is not especially slippery.
No nobility, sold, Parisian pays no politician, hotel bills have no toes.
But the revelation that a rich businessman ruling for the British Labour Party on more than 650.000 pounds (1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people disguised, and that the party failed to announce this is something without the fought Gordon Brown good would have managed.
When two months ago the Prime Minister of the demand for an election had escaped from on stupid way the intelligence of the British offensive, when he said that opinion polls would not have influenced this decision there was hope that it would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, such as vince, increasingly astute agency chairmen of the Liberal Democrats, it expressed, the former brown from Stalin to Mr. bean.
The awkward rescue of northern rock, a bank, struggling weakness and bad discernment pointed under attack.
Badly thought out proposals to change the tax set against the government applied.
The loss of personal data of 25 million people demonstrated inconceivable administrative.
A trio of generals in the retirement started a revolt in the House of Lords in protest against shortening of military expenditure: to be Minister of the armed forces, so they have claimed, was a is.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, labours Secretary-General (and their former fulfilment leader) already resigned.
This means that brown breaks direction open.
Nevertheless governments can reach a turning point to which they feel impossibly to govern.
Neither like still people trust in politicians, but do they normally hold back their scepticism when a new force takes the office.
If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister to improve the situation, and he does not even for a long time, this delay is past: the public service begins to become leaky; the cabinet ministers to start; the press looks for bad news; and the defensive and aimless.
In a way the position of brown particularly difficult, because he compared to other political leaders can not claim to be a new broom.
So with pleasure it Tony Blair would deny, he was.
The problems with northern rock and the issue of, for example, together with decisions that brown made as a Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if not directly involved in Blairs of misfortunes - as in the case of the "money for nobility" of political party financing - may go to the voters that he was.
In spite of that situation is not quite as bad as it looks
The misdemeanours are not so terrible as the Conservatives describe it.
As with Mr. bean, nobody died, or was entirely cheated.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to be delivered, which of course Stalinist promised tendencies always: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new fuss about political contributions is a good example.
The garboeske Abrahams, which compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, says he wants no public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be so, but the decision was not about him.
The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear and they exist for an unequivocal reason: the public has a right to know who is to have access to which rule over the country can be bought.
Watts says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, some questions must, of course, exactly as labours main finance recoverer the about the strange donations in October was told.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing, that it indicates that he knew about this confusion, even though the largest part of the payments made after his taking office in June.
Up to now the Prime Minister finished half of the work.
He has fast violation of legislation by his party, but it diluted this determination by reaching for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry to the topic - led, in order to make the measure full of a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, "this is not to be pulled out very complicated.
If the law was broken, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do something, as a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in public life that has been vacant for six months and to advance with a drastic reform of political party financing.
That would require from the hardliners of labour to co-operate with the Conservatives and possibly in the special financial relationship with the trade unions - which bitter pills for a party comrade as Mr Brown.
But it should be conscious of some partial facts.
The Conservatives have now a clear leadership in the opinion polls; it has two years to recover and voters; the only way it can achieve a victory is through incontestable honesty and sound competence.
