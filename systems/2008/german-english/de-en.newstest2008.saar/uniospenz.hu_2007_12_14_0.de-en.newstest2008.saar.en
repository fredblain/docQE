And the six percent of the Hungarian
As Secretary of the announced, the expert meetings end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international after 2012, the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss about the timetable of Bali, in which the measures for the period after 2012, after the Kyoto protocols, are set.
Currently a fierce debate in progress between industry and development countries.
The United States has that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers, however, they would be ready until 2020 greenhouse gas emissions, the relative to 1990, in order to reduce percent.
The other great question of the conference is whether the industrial countries are ready, the reduction of emissions in the developing countries both financially marching.
There is also an agreement about the support was achieved by developing countries.
The Kyoto protocols Adaptation Fund is supposed to be administered by a 16-koepfigen advice, presumably at the Global Environment Facility (gef) of the UN, as in the "piac profit" is posted.
Hungary's six percent
Secretary of the States in the name of Hungary the effort of the EU took their with global, and to achieve a new international agreement to 2009.
The Minister said that the EU until 2020 greenhouse gas emissions, to reduce the 20% (from the values of 1990), regardless of whether the agreement is successfully obtained after 2012 ", or not, the Union would be even ready to support a reduction other great industrial nations of the world, and / or developing countries are also willing, their obligations after forces and responsibly.
Of the stressed that the aim of the States that joined the Kyoto in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the European Union with its then 15 Member States already committed to a minus of 8%.
The guideline for Hungary is reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6% in comparison with the years - a guideline will absolutely fill the country as in the press release of the Ministry of the environment is posted.
The stakes are high on Bali - after all, the long-term international agreements within two years ready, otherwise it would certainly have only come into force after 2012, which in this case would not renewed established in the Kyoto Protocol, international emission reduction consequences, whose importance also the IPCC, the international scientific distinguished with the Nobel Peace Prize of the UNO in his recent report has emphasized.
Through that the emission reduction would be delayed, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth more than 2 Â° C inevitable, which would be extremely serious and irreparable consequences according to the result.
