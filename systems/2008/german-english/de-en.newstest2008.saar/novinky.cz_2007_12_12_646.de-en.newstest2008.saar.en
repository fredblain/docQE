Test Peugeot 207 1.6 1.6: voruteile fade
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving were not much value to refer to the quality of the control as well as the processing could one as rather designate below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, on the market and this is much better.
In combination with the designation sw is still go further and only remains for me to revise my opinion.
As I had tested the classical hatchback 207, I had to complain about the too low, for example on the rear seats.
There are now no longer these complaints, because the body combination is formed in such a way that not even suffer.
Fast further
I go by only in order not to repeat myself too very much.
It is a question of a quite succeeded design, where I have only because of the miserable central tunnel's objections.
There I would welcome a little more designerische organization, where the car makes otherwise a so elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past the times of where we too short seats or.
Even the side has fundamentally improved in comparison with the 206.
Regarding the space is concerned, you here can feel the increased dimensions of the body.
In the combination of already mentioned lack of head freedom.
Suitcase into the trunk
The main thing at this step forward is the back seats.
(The I must also because of the reverse window) as very well beladbar and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with safety belts which represent an ideal compromise.
You do not disturb can and hold even more difficult objects.
But, we talk about the drawer volume.
It is according to table in the basic equipment 428 compared to competition, which is a rather average value.
Not compared to the vehicle of this class, the? fabia.
If we take the 207 1.6 with the new generation of product from Mlad√° Boleslav compare, we find that the Peugeot around clearly perceptible 52.
For a foreign vacation or when inviting a buggy this value is already critical.
But in order to emphasize the positiva, I must have the loading space completely flat after turning the back seats or also mention the very low.
120 HP in four row
Our was with a petrol engine with capacity of 1.6 litres and an achievement of 88 kilowatts.
And frankly, it should have a look, which propels a family.
It is quiet, has a small consumption and attract good way.
When I compare it with its counterpart with? comparisons, which sometimes works as if its exhaust with a rag been blocked, then I can only be inspired by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not just national.
We must remember, however, that we have a well equipped car with a spacious innneren and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400th gasoline engine at the level of 329900 crowns still starts.
With our engine it costs from 410900 Crowns which is already quite a lot.
The equipment of the test car once again with 80000 crowns besides.
We had, however, bags automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper electrical window lifters behind and and...
So the car costs in total 531900 crowns settles.
That is a lot, but they expect the options of a fabia once and they will arrive with a very similar sum.
Therefore only the decision, which mark one vote.
