Venus is the twin of earth
The Venus, despite their anti-life atmosphere of the earth of similar than up to now thought: the European space probe "Venus express" has flashes in the atmosphere and discovers in Poland, as they arise in the winter also on earth.
Since almost three decades of scientists suggest that there is on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus express" produced the proof - it sought out electromagnetic waves on the fringe of the atmosphere: the flashes on the Venus fire at a value of approximately 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud Christopher, reports from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "nature".
According to the famous "ursuppen-theorie" flashes life on earth develop: thunderstorms should have stimulated in the ocean reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the elements of life.
Not so on the Venus: "if there were ever lives there, it must have been in the very early history", Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington.
Today, it is on the surface of the Venus little live: the atmosphere is about a hundred times more closely than on earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus is perhaps the of the earth, but it is a twin", said russel.
Why the Venus, the earth in mass and size so similar, such a completely different development, is the basic question.
The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research as, since the beginning of the nineties no probe more particularly for the study of this planet was under way.
The most recent research results now in several "nature" are presented to underline in the view of the researchers, not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"You also show that in parallel with the earth is larger than initially accepted" the ESA informs.
For example, next to the already known whirlwind researchers at the North Pole also at a, it is still far more quickly.
The phenomenon reminds air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere to a group piccioni of the Italian Istituto Giuseppe Di astrofisica spaziale e hemisphere.
The second innermost planet of the solar system is almost the same as the earth is excessive and with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers almost as large.
Also as a or the planet referred circles in scarcely 225 days around the sun.
But he concerns a lot slowly themselves: a will take 243 earth.
Although the Venus with of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar scarcely on the earth scientists assume that both planet had arisen under very similar conditions.
On both water that remained on the earth in oceans, on which Venus but lost into the area.
And while while on earth in carbonate rocks on the Venus, does the majority of the atmosphere.
