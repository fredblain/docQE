<seg id="2"> The hypermarkets in also have this year the average increase in prices of 16% from the last year, with the difference this year that there is no increase in the value-added tax.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Article from napi gazdaság</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In the budaoerser, the price of the usual Christmas "napi" also this year around 16% were increased, but in all price increases of more registered.</seg>
<seg id="5"> After the prices in the food markets last December "," the price increase not out to be drastic, compared with the previous already high level.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, it has an effect on consumers certainly as a deterrent that that is what they are, in the last year still far below paid hoof, not even for 10,000 this year is available.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The price of the "napi" basket crossed the by at least 91 hoof studied in the markets.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The highest price amounted hoof.</seg>
<seg id="9"> (the price, at 6.800.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The prices for unicum and live fish almost remained on previous, have, on the other hand the prices for nut and poppy.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, there were cut, however, for forint 139.</seg>
<seg id="12"> There was no mention product limited price slump with less than 200 forint.</seg>
<seg id="13"> This is also what the price of a stroke of under two Coca-Cola 200 forint, thus the drink cost including pledge only in 257.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless, this year in the "napi" at the most expensive and at best.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Our calculations indicate that the prices in the "napi" market basket vis-à-vis the Christmas prices in the last year, while Tesco around 15 and 18% cut in each case raises.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The difference between the cheapest market basket of the previous year and the most expensive of this year amounted to 12%, while the increase between market basket of last year and this year formed of 21%.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The average price rise, 1.480,00.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The average increase in prices was still at 1,206.00 last year, however, the tax increase in prices to apparent last Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="19"> Just this process found the trade badly: seemingly the department stores could not decide so right which price margin they should use in the individual articles, because the effects of the increase in prices for the consumer, unpredictable.</seg>
<seg id="20"> (if the vendor is on the rotation speed of a product badly, it can fall around essential profits in the price margin that follows the undertaken.)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The price increase of the "napi" turned out in the last year so radically, that the most expensive basket the value of 2006 about 1720 exceeded, whereas the difference in prices at the cheapest basket only 844 forint was.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost about 1.630,00 forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a rise in prices of 1,284.00.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In the comparison of the two last Christmas showed a catastrophic increase in prices, the price of the daily consumer items on the in less than 20 months for more than 30% per year.</seg>
<seg id="24"> (this is not necessarily confirmed the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, with some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months a more than a price increase.</seg>
<seg id="25"> So in about beside flour also with eggs.)</seg>
<seg id="26"> However, one looked into the "napi" market basket, this seems almost impossible with the latter, because the price of the product already in the previous year even in the worst case for little more than 10 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Obviously are in a stronger position than the egg - after all they could the drastic increase in prices to the multis shift.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> In the golden the hypermarkets do not complain, constantly about good years.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores does not look at the prices more.</seg>
<seg id="30"> From all large quantities are bought, lasting foods go in over the counters.</seg>
<seg id="31"> Wednesday morning, all three department stores endless with the cash when suddenly the number of customers exploded.</seg>
<seg id="32"> However, the country is a smaller customer frequency reports, so that many multis deplore themselves with the, they could not achieve even the planned turnover, and not just with food, but also with lasting consumer goods.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> This year more than a thousand infections in hospitals that due to inappropriate handling antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of personnel - factors, that the embankment of the infections are not just benign so the leading doctor of the national.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In many cases also near the saving.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the traumatology-department of the to hospital a mrsa-infection was diagnosed recently.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient, after a serious accident to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The patient was isolated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The injured person of a hard car accident was released from the hospital, the man had little later return, however, with a mrsa-infection an important because of the operation, since that is still in the body of patients, not yet carried out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Until 10 December of this year from hospitals activated by pathogens infections scale to the national nosocomialis surveillance system, so the leading doctor of the national,.</seg>
<seg id="11"> So many activated by scale, pathogens infections were registered in the hospitals therefore with security, may be higher in the darkness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were against by the methicillin-oxacillin of resistant staphylococcus unnecessarily.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The staphylococcus (SA) bacterium bears about a third of the people in their nose without its causing an illness.</seg>
<seg id="14"> SA limited infections (as inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) react mostly well to antibiotics, they are well curable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The means are however measured out too high or used, arise from the well respondierenden antibiotics resistant bacteria under appropriate conditions spread out in the hospitals quickly.</seg>
<seg id="16"> In the case of patients with badly or permanently immune systems, but also in older, or patients with small body weight can these bacteria difficult infections, such as or wound poisoning, therefore, cause.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The scale of the medical according to hospital is nothing special, such occurrences life.</seg>
<seg id="18"> One must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte a - there are not only there, where it is not searched.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Resistant to antibiotics</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "such patients are isolated, the nursing staff bears rubber and masks the supply, and we have the antibiotics, necessary for the treatment of" - so.</seg>
<seg id="21"> With their admission into the hospital to the patients to be examined, not always an infection can be avoided.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Sampling too rare</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The majority of initiated by infections in hospitals would be avoidable, however the currently prevailing conditions and conditions for the checking of stemming the origin or the spread of the virus, says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> After this infection mainly in hospitals and homes for the elderly, the taken patients should examine and mrsa-infected immediately isolate.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not quite so often.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Last but not least because it sides of the national health no subsidies for this investigation.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Most cases would not come to light before then therefore if anybody has a noticeable, according to the medical head of the epidemiology Center.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> In addition, the European Union, there are strict recommendations regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there is, however, also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be precise, that is, microbiological studies are necessary, so that no resistance to the means, however, that this directive is not always kept by hospitals either.</seg>
<seg id="30"> Under the or in the basic contained patient microbiological sampling are even more scarce, however.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In the case of the saving will</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Scientific evidence proves that to patients with one of the most widely on the other is transmitted by nursing staff.</seg>
<seg id="33"> So the manual washing, or carrying gloves and masks a great importance, however, there are also in this area considerable shortcomings in the hospitals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> To is transmitted through droplet infection or contact in the indigenous hospitals, it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The rooms are even often full the beds connected barely even epidemiological view between them from a distance of at least 1.5 meters should be.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> As karolina keep saying, it happens unfortunately in the financially less well set hospitals even that near saved, there are few nurses, many patients - factors, which almost favour the emergence of infections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there or the further spread of the virus can be stopped where these protective measures are followed, however.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Political capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the view of the Department of risk analysis (risk division) of political capital in the activities of this August with support from the "movement for a better Hungary" Hungarian created guard the risk of Hungary and the region in several respect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In the "risk" of the institute does among other things: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk sets the "intensification of already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and in Hungary, even in the short term, which could lead to violent ethnic quarrels."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The main reason is the Hungarian guard, probably at the provocation of such a confrontation, for example at the research institute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> How reports, this is a failure on the part of the politically responsible considered: "public discussion of have with representatives of radical political grouping, who are now based their political strategy on the".</seg>
<seg id="6"> One presumes that the problem, the reasonable dialogue impossible extremities favour, as well as the probability of violent quarrels would increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The forschungsinsitut means the activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the domestic and foreign media, "the picture of Hungary abroad substantially, particularly in confidence in the stability and democratic maturity is concerned."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> We remember: since fall 2006 the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary is accelerating, so that since summer 2007 several association, "national" naming organizations were established.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "these groups is that in each case define as a civil organization, while they are boasting about that openly their members on - sometimes armed - tasks, preparing (disaster protection, national Defense), with reference to the unsuitability of the police, the army or the State itself," called it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Further, and this in accordance with that method which is focused on the political and various moroseness of the population based, political efforts as civil initiative to camouflage.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The emphasis on civilian character and the association not merely serve the avoidance of legal hurdles in the course of the registration in court could emerge - it is also a political strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> What is to be understood from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian guard a risk factor for the relations with the States.</seg>
<seg id="13"> In recent months, the Hungarian guard in several States as a potential source of surveys, for politician of certain countries sees in the origin of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own.</seg>
<seg id="14"> All this has effects on the political stability of the region - it was called ".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> From the point of view of the research institute the creation of the Hungarian guard no in, thus the political risk increased for the entire region.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As reports, the activities of the Hungarian guard comparable with those of the Bulgarian national guard, in the creation of the Bulgarian's National Union (bnu) was announced.</seg>
<seg id="17"> In the background of the Bulgarian guard were in a mass of Sofia quarters (krasna poljana) stood.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The bnu took as an opportunity the incidents for the establishment of the national guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization of the "national protection".</seg>
<seg id="19"> In their view, is the last 17 years a regular "palpable" in Bulgaria, the State remained, however, idle and indifferent - so political capital.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And further: the initiative would have a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public kicked loose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As said that the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard.</seg>
<seg id="22"> There the activities of the Hungarian guard up to now many similarities with those of the Bulgarian national guard shows, not to exclude it is that the Hungarian Roma also with the organization of their own protection to react to the threats that it is called in the risk of political capital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Attila juhász, research with political capital said on request of the report: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.</seg>
<seg id="24"> Risk analysis published, and should is visible tendencies, the public opinion is informed, as in the case with the publication of the risk.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In Hungary holidays are dealt with by law, so that the procedure for the reorganization of the work days around the holidays has now been established, but the coming year little such days.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Also in the EU and in America one means something different by "holiday".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Hungarian judicial system differentiates between state holidays and days.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Work free days are usually ecclesiastical holidays or are related with significant historical events.</seg>
<seg id="6"> We celebrate for example also new year: both the last day of the old, as also the first day of the new year, free days - for the latter to rest.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Throughout the year, we have a total of fourteen holidays.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The state of 15 March are at the revolution of 1848, and 23 October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On 20 August the establishment of state, on 1 May the work celebrated on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In addition there are the two holidays to Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> As our Heads of State or religious holidays rare on a weekend fall, the practice of the "" proved itself in the cases in which we before or after the holiday only a day would work.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The price of the prolonged weekends, however, is that we are very probably work on Saturdays before it, or must go to school.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> When that day before or after the holiday should be processed last finally, since long years by the Employment Minister in its own regulation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The legislation applies to all employers and takers for public employees and civil servants of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Only companies and facilities are excluded, in which the company without interruption, also at the holidays, is continued.</seg>
<seg id="16"> This only rules by holidays at the end of the year are damaged: from the 24th December remains life positively in this country as most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the holidays, particularly for it waived.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Next year more holidays fall into the, and at the end of the week at the working days, so that there will be less than this year.</seg>
<seg id="18"> First the calendar is around the day of the work on the head ", so that the people of four days now at can stay at home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Saturday, the 26 April will be a working day, thereby Friday, 2 May can be a day of rest.</seg>
<seg id="20"> The second change of plans is connected with the holiday on 23 October, on Saturday, the 18 October will be process Friday, 24 October first.</seg>
<seg id="21"> The end of the year will however be in the indication of the holidays, after all, from the 24th December and, if New Year's Eve, even on a Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Six as a deterrent, in order to annoy</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> E-mails which we forget, we never receive - harmless lies, do not strike us anymore at all, ":" at work to the weekday.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The question is whether one becomes of these small inconvenience to put it better, or to the challenge and attempts these misleading, for other annoying situations consciously.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Tips.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> 'Sorry, I forgot to tell you that somebody of the marketing referred - a colleague says ".</seg>
<seg id="6"> That one missed a meeting through?</seg>
<seg id="7"> At best one regrets it and it is again when maybe one phones the marketing department and admitting, one would have forgotten to align the report which is the usual method).</seg>
<seg id="8"> Mostly the thing with an apology.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Before it, embarrassing excuses, one should consider inspire his colleagues can truly prepare unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Something borrowed, which does not belong to one?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> There is hardly a little pithier than if a document, office accessories, or the telephone, but it is not there.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Yesterday, the still on the desk - it is today?</seg>
<seg id="13"> Or is lost believed ballpoint pens, for example on a colleague's desk?</seg>
<seg id="14"> No one should ask nothing of the colleagues borrow, because they are wonder if they find that something disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Thus, no covers or post office from the office put into the bag, because it could meet: no more because, if it's nevertheless urgently needs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Ratchet over the private life of the colleagues?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> There is no effective means, a which has already been put in the world to stop.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Who with whom, done something?</seg>
<seg id="19"> Where and why?</seg>
<seg id="20"> (IT) The information or suggestions about the private life of colleagues not to give way to build the nose!</seg>
<seg id="21"> And if someone opens and tells us its internal secret nevertheless, we should not misuse this confidence!</seg>
<seg id="22"> Best one keeps quiet as a grave instead of just is not present to adjust even if other about the problems of colleagues know also answer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Without reason sick self-employed?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> If one calls in the office in order invoking tormenting headaches sick to answer, because it just feels uneasy, or simply wants to rest, it should take a clear: one's own work, urgent, projects with firm dates must now instead of one's colleagues do.</seg>
<seg id="25"> Do not treat the colleagues badly therefore!</seg>
<seg id="26"> If one already knows at that, in the next day into the office will not create, or that something could get in the way, for which one must stay at home, one should announce it in time so that neither the colleagues, nor the head unexpectedly with the absence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Hum, tittering, phoning</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> One is hollow just in his work, but by the loud giggle of the colleagues disturbed?</seg>
<seg id="29"> Unintentional a telephone conversation that one should not have heard better?</seg>
<seg id="30"> One should not the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (one leads over their heads), trample, or permanent moaning nerve.</seg>
<seg id="31"> All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just in a task (to write) are planning to organize deepened.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The other is to blame?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> A project is not period ready, one has an important letter or forgotten important nachrichte to send, should be the fault of the own forgetfulness not look at other!</seg>
<seg id="34"> As far as possible one should not to the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!</seg>
<seg id="35"> Best one admits his errors and excuses if others were also affected by it!</seg>
<seg id="36"> To combine the mistake again, or which missed retrieve can only too, is inadequate!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> In the office - a sense as at home?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Pants and schlapfen: force for at home, but has been lost in the office nothing!</seg>
<seg id="39"> Not even then one should dress so Leger if the job approved it actually!</seg>

<seg id="9"> The appearance of so many to new and exciting production from the domestic digital underground wearing slowly to a change of the overall picture, and even if the skirt with his gitarrengequitsche is again "in" the domestic proves: there is new under the sun.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In pécs Balázs, ranging from even in the volumes to before he - perhaps, because a pub no two piper - his own path to follow.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The breakthrough with his project (zagar) and its music which elements from jazz, electronic and pop, he only together, but as one with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film had approached him (i.e.</seg>
<seg id="12"> "szezon" of Ferenc töroek).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The formation, which had arisen at first in smaller clubs, was known to the wider public first, as the magazine "wan2" their first album from the year 2002 under the top 50 French and zagar, together with almost only to, for example, also in the West marketable trendsetter.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Without a doubt, and its volume "trendy," it is not interested but whether they bear this brand also with pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="15"> The band reacted, as it should, with a new, even better album.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The now appeared new album entitled the "cannot walk fly" could open new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the pécser years.</seg>
<seg id="17"> The expression originates indeed from the time when Balázs still away with another band.</seg>
<seg id="18"> The airy, flying allusion would be also in order, to fall, however, next to the character of the - the spirit and the trends louder, because of the influences of the rock piano 'n'.</seg>

<seg id="21"> All right, then (?).</seg>
<seg id="22"> The hvg.hu has enquired at Balázs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Hvg.hu: this new raises the question: to what extent does your music of a certain shift remain reserved?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Balázs: the term "i" means not just much.</seg>
<seg id="25"> In my opinion, there are two classes in the pop music, and indeed not mainstream and underground or and pop but rather commercial and honest.</seg>
<seg id="26"> Even the so-called alternative or underground can be shallow and meaningless, but also as it can only be produced for the sale of commercial power to music.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Also a good pop number can arise from an honest motive.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The acceptance of listener functions also according to this principle, independently of languages and borders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Hvg.hu: do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and of foreign public your music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> As zs.: abroad, in particular West of us the pop music has a greater tradition.</seg>
<seg id="31"> There not only on teenagers or concerts, but also the older audience.</seg>
<seg id="32"> They pursue the trends in the pop music, which happen around them, much more attentive, because they also for a part of the contemporary culture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Hvg.hu: what role is attributed to the public during?</seg>
<seg id="34"> It is important, who, where, how many hear your music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> As zs.: it is, of course, a good sense to see that more and more to come to our concerts.</seg>
<seg id="36"> We must never, however, for the market.</seg>
<seg id="37"> For the music does not arise in order to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The role of the public is perceptible mostly at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is only prolong the unreachable changes of the moment.</seg>
<seg id="39"> Nevertheless, one struck me: you want to make it all right, you are not more interesting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Hvg.hu: how far you like to follow the example of?</seg>
<seg id="41"> He is under way, and as has his career in the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> As zs.: we do not in fact his way, once completely disregarded the fact that one attempts again and again in our music.</seg>
<seg id="43"> We see rather than which on the presence of other musical trust and they unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="44"> At the beginning of our work, comparisons with the inevitable to, as several of us come from his band and took another way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> Hvg.hu: in the wings of "wings of love" stands in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="46"> Many have only in connection with this number is the name.</seg>
<seg id="47"> Was the opening with a somewhat style in the direction of a wider public conscious?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> As zs.: we had no plans to write a train horse, then for the excuses.</seg>
<seg id="49"> Here it is a question of more song.</seg>
<seg id="50"> It was considered as a final of the, with which we and the a little more difficult issues will disappear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> Hvg.hu: how did you the six singers?</seg>
<seg id="52"> Why is it, which was the guidance principle?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> As zs.: the idea was to make a gospel well-behaved chorus.</seg>
<seg id="54"> Then came the talented choir from soloists of the indigenous music scene.</seg>
<seg id="55"> So the six-headed choir arose - for sena, edina kutzora, péterfy, eniko "hodosi [neo], sena,, which then we" apäter stars "underground.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> Hvg.hu: you have the song just or do have it the girls?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> As zs.: there was the number in the longer, but when the material was ready for the album, we thought that this number is "something needs".</seg>
<seg id="58"> The piecework has positively asked for a song voice.</seg>
<seg id="59"> I still rings out in the same night, later the girls learned it.</seg>
<seg id="60"> There has been virtually everything immediately and frightening spontaneous.</seg>
<seg id="61"> I can remember, I was then fairly, but it has already needed the "stars" as well.</seg>
<seg id="62"> With my voice alone the song would never have become.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Hvg.hu: both on the plate, as well as in concert had the impression, the girls would be in the background.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The national budget is approved.</seg>

<seg id="5"> It is the first budget which this government projected, and without the support of opposition was accepted.</seg>

<seg id="8"> The Parliament approved have noticed, yet this is highly important law calmly.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This is, as it were, the paradox here.</seg>
<seg id="10"> All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the budget, whether one likes or not.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The budget is an essential component of the policy, however covered by the power of the government and the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="12"> This is a topic for the media, and therefore they dedicate more attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="13"> A quarrel among politicians is much more interesting for the public as a sober numbers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The national budgets suffered from the last social democratic governments under three weak points that the budget for the year 2008 at the same time eliminate not:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The first is the high proportion of spending, because of law obliging, at which it does not only concern the pensions, but also to the spending the "implicit" coalition of ssd and ksm (Communists) in the last year before the choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The second is the fiscal account as a consequence of the first.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The third restriction consists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the deficits of the municipalities.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The greatest risk is not, however, the state budget deficit.</seg>
<seg id="19"> This budget is public and eingermassen under control.</seg>
<seg id="20"> A real time bomb is, however, the budget deficit of the Communities.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Many mayors gave in order to save incomes from taxes, and bank credits further sources for investments, often mostly from financing through which they caused their city halls in the excess.</seg>
<seg id="22"> In recent years, enabling them, these debts by massive sales of stocks of energy and other supply networks, in which they had received from the State to pay off.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Now this source has already dried up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we find that:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Our economy for some years, as the rest of the world, a growth through, whose incessantly boasts about ran the.</seg>
<seg id="26"> That represented a unique possibility for their governments, public finances in order.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Instead, the state of these governments were, however, still more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have much more reasonable than our Republic.</seg>
<seg id="29"> That is a giant disgrace which mainly be ascribed to the former governments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> We belong to the countries in the global scale, seen the least of poverty are threatened.</seg>
<seg id="31"> This is not, unfortunately, social nassiven needed just in the last years very in gigantic extent was blown up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Even if it is able, a part of the unreasonable populist spending, which were adopted this year before the elections, altogether, if it is clear that soon lead to a shift of the pension entry age and come to a reform, then virtually any policy in this country, and, very quickly, who is in power, he will not have anything as a pure administration.</seg>
<seg id="33"> It is only easily exaggerated if it is, then, that existing officials from politicians, who are the largest part of the tax revenues mechanically on pensions and social.</seg>
<seg id="34"> Therefore the this year's budget can not be a revolution, but it can only the expulsion of normal outputs by duty.</seg>
<seg id="35"> The deficit intended for 2008 of 70 billion Crowns would be quite superfluous if former governments in the last ten years have not spent, which only worked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> If we do not want that in fact it results in that, at verwaltungsbeamte from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this strong coalition government too, that it is conscious that the state can issue only as much as he taxes and fees is able to take rest during the preparation of further wish.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Its driving were not much value to refer to the quality of the control as well as the processing could one as rather designate below average.</seg>
<seg id="4"> But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, on the market and this is much better.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In combination with the designation sw is still go further and only remains for me to revise my opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> As I had tested the classical hatchback 207, I had to complain about the too low, for example on the rear seats.</seg>
<seg id="7"> There are now no longer these complaints, because the body combination is formed in such a way that not even suffer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Fast further</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> I go by only in order not to repeat myself too very much.</seg>
<seg id="10"> It is a question of a quite succeeded design, where I have only because of the miserable central tunnel's objections.</seg>
<seg id="11"> There I would welcome a little more designerische organization, where the car makes otherwise a so elegant impression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The seats are comfortable, and past the times of where we too short seats or.</seg>
<seg id="13"> Even the side has fundamentally improved in comparison with the 206.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Regarding the space is concerned, you here can feel the increased dimensions of the body.</seg>
<seg id="15"> In the combination of already mentioned lack of head freedom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Suitcase into the trunk</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The main thing at this step forward is the back seats.</seg>
<seg id="18"> (The I must also because of the reverse window) as very well beladbar and space-saving.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The cavities are equipped with safety belts which represent an ideal compromise.</seg>
<seg id="20"> You do not disturb can and hold even more difficult objects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But, we talk about the drawer volume.</seg>
<seg id="22"> It is according to table in the basic equipment 428 compared to competition, which is a rather average value.</seg>
<seg id="23"> Not compared to the vehicle of this class, the? fabia.</seg>
<seg id="24"> If we take the 207 1.6 with the new generation of product from Mladá Boleslav compare, we find that the Peugeot around clearly perceptible 52.</seg>
<seg id="25"> For a foreign vacation or when inviting a buggy this value is already critical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But in order to emphasize the positiva, I must have the loading space completely flat after turning the back seats or also mention the very low.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> 120 HP in four row</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Our was with a petrol engine with capacity of 1.6 litres and an achievement of 88 kilowatts.</seg>
<seg id="29"> And frankly, it should have a look, which propels a family.</seg>
<seg id="30"> It is quiet, has a small consumption and attract good way.</seg>
<seg id="31"> When I compare it with its counterpart with? comparisons, which sometimes works as if its exhaust with a rag been blocked, then I can only be inspired by him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The price list speaks volumes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The price of this car is not just national.</seg>
<seg id="34"> We must remember, however, that we have a well equipped car with a spacious innneren and a very good engine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> The basic price of the car with the 1400th gasoline engine at the level of 329900 crowns still starts.</seg>
<seg id="36"> With our engine it costs from 410900 Crowns which is already quite a lot.</seg>
<seg id="37"> The equipment of the test car once again with 80000 crowns besides.</seg>
<seg id="38"> We had, however, bags automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper electrical window lifters behind and and...</seg>
<seg id="39"> So the car costs in total 531900 crowns settles.</seg>
<seg id="40"> That is a lot, but they expect the options of a fabia once and they will arrive with a very similar sum.</seg>
<seg id="41"> Therefore only the decision, which mark one vote.</seg>

<seg id="4"> After all, it is even more difficult to find the suitable insurance as the correct vehicle model.</seg>
<seg id="5"> First, it must be clear to one with what we have to do it here.</seg>
<seg id="6"> A car insurance is an agreement between an assurance company and an insured.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This agreement will be held in writing by means of an versicherungsvertrags damage that society receives and return to a claim is that the appropriate sum paid in compensation.</seg>

<seg id="25"> If you are less than 25 years old, it suits in your hand to lower the cost of insurance; so your credit increases itself when trying to drive, and to avoid accidents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> A credit is a lowering of the base rate in the corresponding assurance company.</seg>
<seg id="27"> For this purpose a payment on an increase of said rate.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> On the part of married couples with children are regarded as the customers with the least accident rate, and correspondingly low also their contribution payments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> In this case, would be a full comprehensive insurance with (with an amount for the 300 Euros) the best option which you will receive a high credit, is recommended an extended insurance, only for the third year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> You go more loosely in total and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to a higher contribution payment determine Luis Noguera.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> It is good for pensioners, with a full deduction (with an amount around 150), the euro or an enlarged insurance which does only with a sufficiently high credit.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="38"> Finally one must observe that the car insurance something very important not only because it protects the driver against possible, but also because it contains high costs require it, that a thorough choice is made, which corresponds to our personal situation.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Memo romey said, it does not consider worthy of a presidential candidate from a to be consulted.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency, ultimately, willing to place itself to a debate on the questions, in ordinary voters video questions and hand in order to send it to the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="4"> None of the questions that on the Wednesday evening, the 28 November, were raised, as ridiculous as the snowman the democrats, about the global warming in the debate of the other party.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time is the state of the Republican Party which opens in the elections next year is open.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It is not known, just as the producers of CNN, the debate, the selected the candidates to selected the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Yet in the first half hour of debate, the longest the a single issue was dedicated, immigration stood in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The issue is one of the strongest topics for Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The CNN asked to manipulate a group of voters to operate a if they heard things that they liked: the television noticed points of the agreement as the candidates talked about the borders severely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner, and romney of in the decisive inquiries in Hampshire and new pushed forward.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Giuliani attempts to shake off the call that he was soft with regard to illegal immigration, when he was mayor of New York.</seg>
<seg id="12"> He attacked romney in that it the former governor of Massachusetts accused of illegal immigrants for working on its House.</seg>
<seg id="13"> The two stopped especially hard as interrogators asked whether one of the candidates a "Amnesty" (illegal a regular status and the way to the citizen would be) would support.</seg>
<seg id="14"> More insignificant candidates as Duncan hunter, a representative, and Tom tancredo, a representative from Colorado, in with this topic.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Neither of the two men have serious chance during the nomination, but both stay in the running, maybe because sooner and harder than others on the immigration bass drum.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At least in the field of immigration, the candidates and the same opinions: sharper borders, intolerance illegal migrants.</seg>
<seg id="17"> This issue, together with fears about poisonous toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world to help the republicans differences between the liberal Conservatives and Christian or to minimize the least.</seg>
<seg id="18"> But the debate was clearly problematic as other topics for the language.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Mr Giuliani was asked, why he supported in the past.</seg>
<seg id="20"> John McCain and romney discussed about whether drowning should be regarded as torture.</seg>
<seg id="21"> One of the interrogators asked whether the candidates every word of the Bible.</seg>
<seg id="22"> This Giuliani representing the point of view that although the Bible is his preferred book, it the history of jonah and perhaps literally did not believe the whale.</seg>
<seg id="23"> A further question regulator asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="24"> MIKE huckabee - now towards all expectations in the first place in an inquiry recently carried out in thanks to his Christian conservatism existing for a long time - said that the death penalty is painful, but necessary.</seg>
<seg id="25"> When he was pushed on whether Jesus would approve it, he said about Jesus was too intelligent in order to apply for a political office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The racing remains open extraordinarily.</seg>
<seg id="27"> Huckabees rise in comes together with Paul's recent and its in the debate of Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="28"> These two are out of nothing, because the two wings of the party up to now not yet on one of the better known and more traditional candidates of some could.</seg>
<seg id="29"> In 1980 and 2000 a candidate from the beginning and convincing together with a victorious message about the size of America and a to both wing of the party.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The labour pains</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Gordon Brown has yet another pit for falling; its way from this remains the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> For British scandals this is not especially slippery.</seg>
<seg id="4"> No nobility, sold, Parisian pays no politician, hotel bills have no toes.</seg>
<seg id="5"> But the revelation that a rich businessman ruling for the British Labour Party on more than 650.000 pounds (1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people disguised, and that the party failed to announce this is something without the fought Gordon Brown good would have managed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> When two months ago the Prime Minister of the demand for an election had escaped from on stupid way the intelligence of the British offensive, when he said that opinion polls would not have influenced this decision there was hope that it would offer a robust, efficient government.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Instead, such as vince, increasingly astute agency chairmen of the Liberal Democrats, it expressed, the former brown from Stalin to Mr. bean.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The awkward rescue of northern rock, a bank, struggling weakness and bad discernment pointed under attack.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Badly thought out proposals to change the tax set against the government applied.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The loss of personal data of 25 million people demonstrated inconceivable administrative.</seg>
<seg id="11"> A trio of generals in the retirement started a revolt in the House of Lords in protest against shortening of military expenditure: to be Minister of the armed forces, so they have claimed, was a is.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, labours Secretary-General (and their former fulfilment leader) already resigned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> This means that brown breaks direction open.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Nevertheless governments can reach a turning point to which they feel impossibly to govern.</seg>
<seg id="15"> Neither like still people trust in politicians, but do they normally hold back their scepticism when a new force takes the office.</seg>
<seg id="16"> If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister to improve the situation, and he does not even for a long time, this delay is past: the public service begins to become leaky; the cabinet ministers to start; the press looks for bad news; and the defensive and aimless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In a way the position of brown particularly difficult, because he compared to other political leaders can not claim to be a new broom.</seg>
<seg id="18"> So with pleasure it Tony Blair would deny, he was.</seg>
<seg id="19"> The problems with northern rock and the issue of, for example, together with decisions that brown made as a Chancellor of the Exchequer.</seg>
<seg id="20"> And even if not directly involved in Blairs of misfortunes - as in the case of the "money for nobility" of political party financing - may go to the voters that he was.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In spite of that situation is not quite as bad as it looks</seg>
<seg id="22"> The misdemeanours are not so terrible as the Conservatives describe it.</seg>
<seg id="23"> As with Mr. bean, nobody died, or was entirely cheated.</seg>
<seg id="24"> And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to be delivered, which of course Stalinist promised tendencies always: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The new fuss about political contributions is a good example.</seg>
<seg id="26"> The garboeske Abrahams, which compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, says he wants no public recognition for his goodwill.</seg>
<seg id="27"> That may be so, but the decision was not about him.</seg>
<seg id="28"> The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear and they exist for an unequivocal reason: the public has a right to know who is to have access to which rule over the country can be bought.</seg>
<seg id="29"> Watts says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, some questions must, of course, exactly as labours main finance recoverer the about the strange donations in October was told.</seg>
<seg id="30"> But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing, that it indicates that he knew about this confusion, even though the largest part of the payments made after his taking office in June.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Up to now the Prime Minister finished half of the work.</seg>
<seg id="32"> He has fast violation of legislation by his party, but it diluted this determination by reaching for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry to the topic - led, in order to make the measure full of a bishop in retirement and a judge.</seg>
<seg id="33"> In this case, "this is not to be pulled out very complicated.</seg>
<seg id="34"> If the law was broken, it is a matter for the police.</seg>
<seg id="35"> In addition, there are other things Mr Brown must do something, as a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in public life that has been vacant for six months and to advance with a drastic reform of political party financing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> That would require from the hardliners of labour to co-operate with the Conservatives and possibly in the special financial relationship with the trade unions - which bitter pills for a party comrade as Mr Brown.</seg>
<seg id="37"> But it should be conscious of some partial facts.</seg>
<seg id="38"> The Conservatives have now a clear leadership in the opinion polls; it has two years to recover and voters; the only way it can achieve a victory is through incontestable honesty and sound competence.</seg>
