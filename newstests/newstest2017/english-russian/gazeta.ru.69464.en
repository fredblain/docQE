The FAS will fine Google 438 million roubles.
Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine against the corporation, Google, in the amount of 438 million roubles, according to the agency's website.
‘The fine against the company, Google, for violation of antimonopoly legislation, amounted to 438 million roubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future’, stated Alexei Dotsenko, Deputy Head of the FAS.
During the investigation, the FAS established that Google is only supplying manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in Russia with the Google Play app store on the condition that the corporation's other applications will also be installed on the device.
The search engine, which must be placed on the home screen of the smartphone, is listed among these applications.
As such, the corporation is in violation of Article 10(1) of the Federal Law ‘On Protection of Competition’ (abuse of a dominant position).
We are confident that enforcement of the order will enable the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The law “On Protection of Competition” must be followed by all companies whose products are available in the Russian Federation, including transnational corporations’, noted Elena Zaeva, Head of the Department for Regulating Communications and Information Technologies at the FAS of Russia.
The agency suspects 16 Russian stores of price collusion.
