Black Sea Fleet personnel carried out training operations to counter threats of underwater sabotage in areas of the Black Sea.
A representative of the press service of the Ministry of Defence for the Navy, Igor Dygalo, reported to RIA Novosti.
The training was conducted as a part of the first phase of exercises in special naval security operations.
‘Military personnel from underwater anti-sabotage units completed work on countering underwater sabotage threats at a naval base on the coast and in the contiguous waters of the Black Sea’, Dygalo clarified.
Around 400 military personnel and more than 10 pieces of military equipment took part in the exercises, including Mi-8 and Ka-27 helicopters, Rook anti-sabotage boats, and Raptor patrol speedboats.
During the naval manoeuvres, guard ships using sonar located hypothetical special forces units and repelled an attack from the sea by ‘underwater saboteurs’ against a Black Sea Fleet naval base.
A Ka-27 helicopter was used to land an airborne assault group, which blocked and eliminated the special forces of the hypothetical enemy.
Afterwards, Black Sea Fleet minesweeping vessels went out to sea to search for mines.
Dygalo stated that ‘these Black Sea Fleet exercises are being conducted in accordance with plans for the preparation and holding of the upcoming command-staff exercise "Caucasus 2016" and the training plan of the Navy’.
Between 18-30 July, Ukraine and the United States held joint naval exercises in the Black Sea, called ‘Sea Breeze 2016’.
About four thousand people from 16 countries took part in the manoeuvres.
More than 25 ships, boats, and support vessels from the United States, Turkey, Romania, and Ukraine were involved in the naval component.
