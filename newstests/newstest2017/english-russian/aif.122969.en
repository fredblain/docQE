The Turkish gambit.
Can Erdogan forgo a friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has given an ultimatum to the United States, demanding a choice be made between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organising the coup.
He announced this while speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdoğan urged the Americans to withdraw support for the Fethullah Terrorist Organisation.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States is urged to change its position.
Experts believe that the rift in Turkey's relations with the West is continuing to grow and could lead to another attempt to change power in the country.
‘Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO (Fethullah Terrorist Organisation).
Either FETO, which organised the coup, or democratic Turkey.
They must make this choice’, the Anatolian Agency quotes Erdoğan as saying in an appeal made on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but this time more sternly, urged the United States to comply with his demand, which he first voiced immediately after quelling the rebellion.
To recall, on the night of 16 July, in Turkey, an attempt was made by high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army to overthrow the country's legitimate government, and an attempt on the life of the head of state was also made.
However, after Recep Erdoğan made an appeal to the people, the rebellion was quelled, and its organisers and participants were arrested.
In total, about 8 thousand people fell under suspicion, including, in addition to military personnel, the likes of teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdoğan, Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States, acted as their mentor.
Erdoğan's supporters have also suggested that the Americans might also have been directly involved in the coup.
The United States has denied all the accusations made against it, refuses to extradite Gülen, and has advised a change in tone.
The most recent statement on this matter from representatives of the State Department were made at the time of Erdoğan's visit to Saint Petersburg this past Tuesday.
However, this is not stopping the President of Turkey, who is stubbornly sticking to his guns and is also making demands on his other Western partners.
‘Ankara will stop fulfilling its obligations under the migration agreement with the EU if Brussels does not set a date for the cancellation of visa restrictions on Turkish citizens’, Turkey’s Minister for EU Affairs, Ömer Çelik, stated on 9 August.
According to him, the introduction of amendments to the anti-terrorism law by Ankara, as required by the EU, would put the internal security of Europe at risk.
Note that, on 1 August, Sigmar Gabriel, Vice Chancellor of Germany, demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with threats to open the borders to migrants, in order to achieve a simplification of the visa regime with the EU.
His words were in response to a corresponding statement from Turkey’s Foreign Minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.
Çavuşoğlu made another provocative statement this past Wednesday, suggesting that Turkey may withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not rule out that the country would consider the possibility of leaving the alliance if they didn't receive the expected support from it.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence sector is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the area of defence, that import missiles’, Çavuşoğlu stated in an interview with Anadolu Agency.
According to him, Turkey, from now on, needs to create its own defence system based on its own technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
‘Up until now, Turkey had been trying to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have been disappointing, and we have started to look for other partners’, the minister said.
Experts believe that all of this speaks to the serious differences between Turkey and the West, and the country's reorientation towards the East.
Director of the International Institute for Political Expertise, Evgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdoğan is playing his game right now and can't afford a serious confrontation with the West.
He is very much tied to the West both in terms of business and in terms of the military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdoğan will try to find a balance, while preserving the framework of relations with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for the Americans to have a completely obedient person in this post’, the expert explained to AiF.
According to him, it can't be ruled out that, following the Turkish leader's statements (about the non-payment of compensation to the EU, demands for a visa-free space with Europe, and the extradition of Gülen from the United States), he will come under pressure.
‘Recep Erdoğan will be faced with a deterioration of relations with America and the European Union, and, in particular, they will apply pressure on him in terms of humanitarian issues, dictatorial methods of governance, and so on’, Minchenko believes.
Director of the Centre for Political Information, Alexey Mukhin, concedes that the President of Turkey will change his point of view on relations with Russia as soon as it's in his interests to do so.
Eight months ago, Erdoğan took a very tough stance against Russia and sought favour in the West by any means.
For a very short time, the situation has been reversed.
There are no guarantees that, after some time, the President of Turkey won't change his priorities once again.
I think that Erdoğan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
Having found himself between the two poles of the West and Russia, he will try to seek maximum benefit for himself’, Mukhin believes.
In his opinion, right now, the main task of the President of Turkey is to hold onto political power in the country, and this is precisely why he needs Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States stops supporting Gülen.
Both the EU and United States need Turkey, with whose help they are controlling the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached’, the expert believes.
A different point of view is espoused by Anna Glazova, Head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East.
Currently, Turkey's relations with both the EU and the United States are quite tense, and this is connected, first and foremost, with the domestic policies being pursued by Erdoğan himself.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen and, against the backdrop of this crisis, Turkey's leaders will try to carry out a reset of policy in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It's no accident that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, claim they are willing to change their stance on a whole range of issues related to Syria, differences with Israel have been settled, and active political engagement with Iran is currently underway’, Glazova explained to AiF, suggesting that Erdoğan's next step will be the normalisation of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy currently being carried out by Erdoğan is a return to the foreign policy concept that was being pursued by Turkey before the start of the Arab revolutions.
‘It was then, from a position of "zero problems with neighbours" that Turkey began to actively develop its relations in the Middle East and Asia’.
The President of Turkey just finished very successful visits to Russia and African countries.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will continue to evolve and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's position both in the regional and international arena’, the expert believes.
Glazova believes that it would be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to the previous relationship with EU; the question right now is whether or not the EU will start to get tough in response to Turkey, which could resort to opening the borders to migrants and, as such, create serious problems for Europe.
