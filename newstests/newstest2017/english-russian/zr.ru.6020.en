Transport tax notices will no longer be sent by mail – Za Rulem website www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending tax assessment notices.
All Russian automobile owners have become accustomed to the system, which has not changed in years: in the summer and fall, they receive a transport tax bill in the mail for the previous year.
However, this year, many of them will be waiting for nothing.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate has quietly changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
Those who signed up for a ‘Personal Taxpayer Account’ on the agency's official website, nalog.ru, will receive notifications in electronic form.
The inspectorate automatically considered those Russians citizens as online users and deleted them from the standard ‘paper’ mailing list.
This new way of doing things will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will receive the same familiar letters as before.
However, it is possible for website account holders to go back to the old system.
To do this, they must visit an office of the tax service during August and file a request.
On the one hand, the new process is more modern and convenient.
A notification will appear on the ‘personal account’ right after it is prepared, whereas a letter will have to travel several days and can even be lost altogether.
On top of that, the number of users of the tax inspectorate's internet service has grown to more than 18 million people, which enables the agency to save substantially on postage.
On the other hand, the meagre news on the inspectorate's website is clearly insufficient to inform citizens about the changed process.
Some people could have registered for a ‘personal account’ for a one-time service and have long since forgotten about it.
These people will not receive notification by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the same category as tax evaders, with all the ensuing consequences.
Access to the ‘Personal Taxpayer Account’ can be achieved three ways: through a user account on the gosuslugi.ru portal, by using an electronic signature, or by entering the login and password specified on a registration card.
The latter can be obtained in-person at any tax office (regardless of place of registration).
It bears reminding that, this year, the transport tax must be paid by 1 December.
The mail out of notifications began in July.
