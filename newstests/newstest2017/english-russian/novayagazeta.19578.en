OSCE observers have not recorded military activity on the Crimean border.
Observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have not recorded military activity on the Russian-Ukrainian border.
This is indicated in a statement published on the organisation's website.
The observers report that the situation on the Crimean border is calm, and that no incidents that could be related to the security of Ukraine and Russia have been recorded.
‘Not one of the observers could confirm media reports that concern safety issues, including gunfire and military activities in close proximity to the administrative border’, the OSCE report states.
The organisation's staff continues to monitor the situation at three checkpoints on the border near the Ukrainian cities of Kalanchak and Chaplinka and the Chonhar Peninsula in the Gulf of Sivash.
Earlier, the State Border Service of Ukraine reported that Russian troops were completing a rotation on the Crimean border.
Moreover, the agency claims that the new contingent has more modern equipment.
