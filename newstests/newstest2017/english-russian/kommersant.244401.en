While the rest of the Russian world watched with bated breath as the Australians came close to trouncing the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know that I was the first to receive the news that Inna Deriglazova had won gold in foil fencing at the XXXI Olympic Games.
I may even be the only Muscovite who saw how it unfolded, except, of course, for those who were watching the competition that night in Carioca.
Only a true fan could understand.
Just imagine: it's the dead of the night in Moscow.
The neighbours downstairs, as per usual, wake up by 1 a.m. and start amicably, but very loudly, shouting at each other.
And threateningly moving the furniture.
In the kitchen, the faucet is leaking: there hasn't been time to drive to the market and buy a new one like the plumber requested.
The TV schedule makes no sense, so I just kept an eye on the channels, Match, First, and, just in case, Russia, although that's almost pointless.
Russia channel is the birthplace of reruns: all the sports on there are prerecorded for some reason.
TV series are broadcast live on there.
I, of course, was counting on Match: the whole evening the young man on the news broadcasts had been shouting first about the great semi-final between Deriglazova and Shanaeva, and then about the impending battle for the gold.
It would have made sense to show it.
But instead of this, it was basketball between the USA and Australia.
By the way, I can't say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were an equal match, and, as a matter of fact, they won the first half.
They put the Americans, deluded by grandeur, in their place.
They still lost in the end, but, like they're now saying, the Olympic basketball tournament will never be the same again.
That's all well and good, but the bout with Di Francisca is drawing near and nothing is changing on the screen.
I start flipping through the channels in a slight panic.
It feels like they are playing it for the second time in a row.
Fine, we'll dig deeper and check the cable channels.
There is no fencing on any of the specialty Match channels.
But, I have a feeling that the bout is just about to start.
I'm not interested in settling for the text and twitter broadcasts of some sports websites.
The spastic channel surfing produces an unexpected but brilliant result.
It turns out that the First Channel website broadcasts the technical videostream of all events in real time.
I click on fencing and get the battle for the gold.
Deriglazova mounts a terrific counterattack, moves ahead in points, and, quite obviously, starts to run out the clock.
The Italian claws back almost all of the lead.
Our girl is one point ahead with just a little more than two seconds to go.
Di Francisca lunges at Deriglazova and the latter retreats; time is running out and the Italian makes a play.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic messenger on my phone notifies me of the fourth gold medal.
As it turns out, I am the first to see it with my own eyes.
My crazy, loyal, involved eyes.
