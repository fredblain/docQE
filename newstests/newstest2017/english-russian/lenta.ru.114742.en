Staff at the Centre for Refugees in Sandholm, Denmark, has become suspicious that the teenagers living there are engaged in prostitution.
The Local reported this on Thursday, 11 August.
According to them, some teenagers told the institution's staff that ‘someone in Copenhagen is organising prostitution’.
As the publication notes, shelter employees started becoming suspicious after the Swedish newspaper, Sydsvenkan, reported similar stories in Malmö.
In 2015, a crisis erupted in the European Union as a result of the influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
Denmark has accepted more than 20 thousand of them into country.
