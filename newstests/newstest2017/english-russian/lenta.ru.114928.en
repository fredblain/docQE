The Ministry of Interior of Thailand has blamed local saboteurs for explosions at resorts.
The explosions at resorts in Thailand are ‘acts of local sabotage’ and are in no way connected with the activities of international terrorists.
Thailand's police stated this, Reuters reports.
According to law enforcement officials, they have still not been able to ascertain whether any of these explosions are connected.
According to the primary theory, their organisers were attempting to disrupt tourist season.
It cannot be ruled out that Muslim separatists from the south of the country are behind the explosions.
Law enforcement agencies have already detained several people.
At the moment, it is known that there are four dead and several dozen wounded.
The country's Prime Minister, Prayut Chan-ocha, has ordered the implementation of additional security measures to prevent further explosions and rule out additional victims.
A series of explosions occurred at tourist resorts in Thailand on Friday, 12 August.
The devices were detonated at police stations on the island of Phuket, and in the cities of Surat Thani (the capital of the province of the same name, within which the island of Koh Samui is located) and in Hua Hin.
Another explosive device that was planted on the beach was defused by bomb disposal specialists.
One day earlier, on 11 August, two explosions occurred in the resort town of Hua Hin.
The bombs were inside of plant pots and were activated by a call from a mobile phone.
10 foreign tourists are among the victims; there are no Russian citizens among them.
