The owners of messenger apps and email services must identify users and remove prohibited information: such is the summary of a bill developed by the Media-Communications Union (MKS), which unites Russia's largest communications service providers (Vedomosti has a copy).
Employees from three companies that are members of the union have confirmed that such a proposal is being discussed.
It should be presented to a working group headed by First Deputy Prime Minister, Igor Shuvalov, in early autumn, says Vedomosti's source in the MKS.
The issue concerns amendments to laws on communications and mass media.
They stipulate that any ‘organiser of information disseminated on the internet, which enables the exchange of electronic messages’, is obliged to identify users based on information contained in the service provider's databases, having previously entered into agreements with them.
As well as ‘immediately block messages or publications that contain information that is distributed in violation of the requirements of Russian legislation’.
Alternatively, operators may restrict access to the service based on a decision by Roskomnadzor.
