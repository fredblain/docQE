The state continues to tighten the screws on the military-industrial complex.
‘Systematic failure to implement’ the orders of the director general of Almaz-Antey Concern, ‘shortcomings in work’, and ‘a loss of trust’ were the grounds for the dismissal.
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of the scientific production association for the next three years.
Information about Neskorodov's dismissal only appeared on Thursday evening and didn't evoke a wide response in the media.
How can such silence in the face of a major rearmament of the military be explained?
Most likely, the Russian leadership does not want any rumours or negative speculation circulating in the public sphere.
This, once again, confirms that there are many problems within the military-industrial complex (MIC), and the government does not want to attract the public's attention to them.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event from the perspective of restoring order in the industry.
The Almaz Scientific Production Association is the concern's principal enterprise, which specialises in the production of sea and land-based air defence missile systems (ADMS).
Currently, Almaz is working on the development of the Poliment-Redut and Morpheus ADMSs, which are slated to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers, and cruisers.
Dmitry Kornev, founder of the internet portal, Military Russia, believes that Neskorodov's dismissal was brought about by a failure to meet the delivery deadlines for these projects.
This theory is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began back in 2007, and it was expected to be put into commission in 2013.
Poliment-Redut is set to be the main antiaircraft defence system on the Navy's newest vessels.
According to the information I'm receiving, over several years of testing, there hasn't been a single truly successful test.
Granted, as far as I can gather, Almaz is not entirely to blame for this, Kornev said.
The expert fears that a delay could also occur in the commissioning of the S-500 ADMS.
Development and engineering work on the project is still not completed, but the first systems are supposed to be operational in 2016.
The Ministry of Defence assured that ‘work is going according to plan and everything will be completed within the prescribed time limits’, although, in 2014, the department admitted that there are problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional abilities of Neskorodov, who had been in charge of Almaz since 2011.
Kornev noted that the failure to meet delivery deadlines for the projects could be both a pretext and the reason for the dismissal.
In his opinion, over the past few years, it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about the internal dealings of the military industrial complex and about the management plans of enterprises.
The industry received long-term contracts worth tens of billions of roubles, and, as is well know, big money loves peace and quiet.
As a rule, directors of defence companies resign from a post of their own accord, according to an agreement of mutual understanding between the parties, or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal happened publicly, even if it didn't evoke a response.
This suggests that the head of Almaz was, perhaps, an obstinate figure, and resisted an ‘order’ issued from above.
It would appear that the state no longer intends to put up with such behaviour.
It will use the shareholders to remove those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defence’s directives and do not fulfil assigned tasks.
At the same time, the Russian leadership is aiming to punish managers who have been caught stealing (fraud at the Zvezda shipyard).
The President is personally paying greater attention to problems in this sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin defends a number of managers in the military-industrial complex, with the aim of having a loyal group of directors on hand, who will implement orders received from above.
It's a far from ideal policy, but amidst rampant corruption and the absence of real competition in the military-industrial complex, the state doesn't have any other instruments.
Of course, the current situation in the defence industry isn't catastrophic, but the present geopolitical environment is galvanising the Kremlin to whip the Armed Forces into shape as quickly as possible.
Alongside the ‘crackdown’ on managers in the military-industrial complex, the Russian leadership is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The army's professional personnel have acquired a new level of quality since the advent of Sergei Shoigu to the post of defence minister.
You get the impression that the President has taken to heart the famous expression: ‘If you want peace, prepare for war’.
During the Cold War, the military might of the USSR and nuclear parity reached in the 1970s, led to the signing of the Helsinki Pact, which cemented Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
For all of the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
The absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East were proof of this.
The triumph of the ‘winners’ of the Cold War eventually turned into a strengthening of international terrorism.
Following a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States, there is probably not a single peaceful corner left in the ‘civilised world’.
In spite of this shared peril, the West refuses to engage with Russia as an equal partner.
In such circumstances, the only allies our country has left are the navy and the army.
A military build-up will enable Moscow to effectively advance national interests and break new ground in global affairs.
