Scientists have discovered an animal that can live for 500 years
An international team of biologists have come to the conclusion that the longest-living vertebrate is the Greenland shark, which can live for approximately 500 years, RT reports.
Scientists conducted radiocarbon analysis of the eye lenses of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, with a length exceeding five metres, could be between 272 and 512 years old.
The biologists believe that a slow metabolism, which results in slower development, plays an important role in the shark's longevity.
Female Greenland sharks only reach sexual maturity by the age of 150.
Previously, it was thought that the longest living of all the vertebrates was the shark's ‘neighbour’: the Greenland whale.
The oldest such specimen known to scientists was slightly older than 210 years.
