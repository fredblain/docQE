The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
A UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny using chlorine gas, however, UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, considers the fact of what happened to be indisputable.
Similar allegations were made just before the third round of inter-Syrian talks that should begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have opened an investigation into reports that chemical weapons were used in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about a terrorist attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine gas, appeared on 2 August.
At that time, the opposition said that aircraft dropped bombs with a poisonous substance in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day, but Moscow deemed these accusations to be utterly false.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence blamed the opposition group, Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki, for the incident.
Soon thereafter, it came to light that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by one of the victims speaking to BBC.
‘A few minutes later, I could smell the gas, my eyes started to burn, and it became difficult to breathe’, the publication quotes the witness as saying.
At least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalised as a result of the attack.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be regarded as a war crime.
UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: ‘there is a lot of evidence that this actually did take place’.
The prohibition of the use of chlorine gas for military purposes is spelled out in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
In spite of the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny using toxic gases, in 2015, human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the Syrian army using chlorine gas against the ‘moderate opposition’.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that its districts are being bombarded on a daily basis, and the terrorists are preventing the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN is waiting for Russia to establish a ‘humanitarian pause’ in military operations.
The current regime of a daily, three-hour halt to hostilities, in the opinion of the organisation, is ‘insufficient to help the nearly 2 million civilians who are caught in the trap’.
Staffan de Mistura's advisor for humanitarian affairs, Jan Egeland, stated that, in order to deliver aid into the city and evacuate the sick and wounded, a 48-hour cease-fire every week would be required.
‘We have to send bulk cargo in convoys of trucks into an area where the roads are virtually destroyed and those that remain are mined’, reported Mr Egeland. But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table’.
In Geneva, consultations between representatives of the United States and Russia, regarding the establishment of a ‘humanitarian pause’, continue.
How Russia opened ‘humanitarian windows’ in Aleppo.
On 11 August, amidst the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia announced the introduction of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will take place daily starting on Thursday.
The creation of ‘humanitarian windows’ is intended to enable the delivery of medicine, food, and basic necessities into the city.
The decision by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation was made in the face of growing international pressure on Moscow with requests to scale back the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
