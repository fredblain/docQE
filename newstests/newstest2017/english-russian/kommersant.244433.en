Footballer Hakan Şükür is suspected of involvement in the coup.
Turkish authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Hakan Şükür, a former football player and then a member of parliament, and have carried out searches at his family's two houses.
A star of Turkish football in the 1990s and early 2000s, striker Hakan Şükür is wanted by authorities in connection with the coup attempt that took place last month.
The forward, who ended his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to ‘an armed terrorist group’.
This is in reference to the Hizmet Movement: a society associated with the well-known Turkish religious and opposition leader, Fethullah Gülen.
This is whom President Erdogan considers to be the organiser of the military coup attempt that occurred on 15 July.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, and Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.
According to local media, today, an arrest warrant was issued for Hakan Şükür, and police have already carried out searches at the two houses that belong to the family of the former football player.
According to investigators, in addition to Hakan Şükür, his father was also part of Fethullah Gülen's organisation.
However, neither the former football player, nor his relatives were there.
Currently, he and his family are living in the United States.
As a football player, Hakan Şükür defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.
He spent the better part of his career with Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italy's Torino, Inter, and Palermo, as well as England's Blackburn.
Although, he never spent more than one season with any of them.
Hakan Şükür still holds the title for highest-scoring striker on Turkey's national team: he has 112 matches for the national team under his belt and scored 51 goals.
In 2013, Hakan Şükür resigned from his parliamentary post as a result of the initiation of corruption investigations surrounding Erdogan's party and his inner circle.
According to the Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, on 25 July, arrest warrants were issued for at least 42 journalists in Turkey.
They are accused of aiding the military coup and having ties to the oppositionist Islamic preacher, Fethullah Gülen, who is living in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, these members of the media can expect lengthy prison sentences ranging from ten years to several life sentences.
