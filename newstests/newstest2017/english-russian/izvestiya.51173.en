The government has extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctioned goods
The government has extended the deadline for the destruction of food products prohibited from entering Russia until the end of 2017.
The corresponding decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official internet portal for legal information.
The embargo against countries that have imposed anti-Russian sanctions over the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, and is now valid until 31 December 2017.
In Russia, it is prohibited to import certain agricultural products, raw materials, and food from the United States, EU countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.
In particular, the ban covers meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits, and dairy products.
The disposal of food products imported into the country in contravention of the embargo has been underway in Russia since August 2015.
Just in the first quarter of 2016, approximately 100 t of prohibited goods have been withdrawn from sale.
