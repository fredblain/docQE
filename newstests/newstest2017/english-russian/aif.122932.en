Why should the children of Cossacks have classes at schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, 'Cossacks need to be educated not with campaigns and parades, but in a systematic manner'.
They should grow up and, at the very least, from the age of 7, understand that they are Cossacks and their education should be Cossack.
But so far this work, it seems to me, is being carried out as a mere formality, and, I suspect, primarily just on paper.
If Cossack classes incorporate everything positive that has been previously accumulated and take it to a whole new level, then I will be pleased.
If everything is done in a hurry and without knowing how to go about it, then this new idea will result in cheap populism.
