The former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) has been taken to court
The Moscow Prosecutor's Office has approved an indictment in a criminal case, investigated by the Main Investigations Directorate of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, concerning the embezzlement of budgetary funds allocated for use by the FSIN of Russia.
The former head of the prison service, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, will appear before the court, having inflicted damages to the FSIN in an amount of more than 2.7 billion roubles.
The capital’s prosecutor's office referred the criminal case against the former director of the FSIN of Russia, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy, Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the director of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise (FSUE), Centre for Information Technology and Communications of the Federal Penitentiary Service (TSITOS), Victor Opredelenov, to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court.
Depending on their role and degree of participation in the crimes, they are accused by the Main Investigations Directorate of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for Moscow under Article 285(3) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers entailing grave consequences), and Article 159(4) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using one's official position, in an organised group, on an especially large scale).
Furthermore, Krivolapov is charged under Article 222(1) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, between 2010 and 2012, the indicated persons fraudulently stole budgetary funds from the state treasury that were allocated to the FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled individuals, otherwise known as electronic ankle bracelets.
To embezzle the budgetary funds, the members of the group developed a scheme whereby FSUE TSITOS, an enterprise controlled by them and with whom relevant government contracts were signed, handled the technical means of control and surveillance, including ‘electronic bracelets’, and charged prices that were inflated several times over.
In spite of the fact that FSUE TSITOS had no production equipment, buildings, or structures to house the production facilities necessary to create a complete production cycle for ‘electronic bracelets’, five contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles were signed between it and the FSIN of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles ended up in the accounts of the Samara branch of the FSUE, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
As suggested by the investigation, more than 140 million roubles of the cashed money was personally received by Mr Reimer in his official office from one of the accomplices, whose criminal case was severed.
Ammunition, obtained from an unknown source for a special service award gun, was found in the possession of Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the fraud, which resulted in the laying of additional charges against him.
In regards to this case, the size of which amounted to 133 tomes, FSIN has filed a lawsuit against the accused for compensation of material damages in the amount of 2.7 billion roubles.
