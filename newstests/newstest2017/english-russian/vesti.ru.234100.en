Many have heard about the ‘Varna Gold’, the earliest gold objects created by man (4600-4200 BC).
It was probably the biggest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during excavations of the Varna Necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artefacts were found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilogrammes.
990 gold objects, weighing more than 1.5 kg, were recovered from just one burial site, known as ‘Grave No. 43’.
However, the official title of oldest gold in the world may soon be handed over to a rather insignificant-looking bead found by archaeologists in July of this year.
Notably, it was also found in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunatsite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunatsite is located inland, near the village of Yunatsite in Pazardzhik District.
The bead is made from a gold band rolled into a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiev, leader of the excavation at Tell Yunatsite, has dated the find at 4600 BC and said that it's older than the gold of Varna by at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, you will recall, date from around the same period, 4600-4200 BC.
Currently, no technology exists that makes it possible to date metal with perfect accuracy.
So, where is the certainty about which gold is more ancient coming from?
Obviously, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters news agency: ‘I am absolutely sure that the Yunatsite gold is older than the Varna gold’.
This is a discovery of extraordinary importance: it looks like a tiny object, but it is big enough to take its rightful place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev announced that, in the near future, scientists will analyse the composition of the metal, and will once again examine, and this time more thoroughly, the archaeological layer where the gold artefact was found.
This will help to date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Yunatsite is a well-known settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Currently, Tell Yunatsite is considered to be the most ancient ‘city’ in Europe.
Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the course of the following centuries, metalworking rapidly developed in this region: from the acquisition of the first metallurgical skills, to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the local historiography, there is a special name for this archaeological community: the Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban settlements started to emerge around the metalworking centres.
Now they are called the most ancient cities of Europe.
Tell Yunatsite is quite possibly the most ancient of them all, given that artefacts from 4900 BC have been found here.
I would call Tell Yunatsite a prototype of the modern city, despite the fact that it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
‘This place is older than Sumer by a thousand years’, says Boyadzhiev, bearing in mind the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in Southern Mesopotamia, which is modern Iraq.
That is where the first cities, in the usual sense of the word, arose.
The excavation of Tell Yunatsite has been underway since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about one third of the total estimated area of the settlement.
The remains of a fortress wall, which, at one time, reached a height of three metres, were discovered.
Little has survived from the houses and workshops, but archaeologists can distinctly make out streets, public buildings, dense urban housing, a ‘business centre’, and residential suburbs.
Tell Yunatsite is often called the ‘Bird City’: dozens of clay bird figurines were found here.
All of the birds were depicted at rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but rather the subject of a local cult.
The ‘Bird City’ was destroyed around 4100 BC, possibly by Indo-European tribes that came from the northeast.
The nomads didn’t have cities, but did have horses and weapons.
The three-metre-high fortress walls didn't stop them.
Archaeologists have discovered obvious signs of a brutal massacre: the remains of elderly people, women, and children, with evidence of wounds inflicted by battle-axes, were found inside of the houses.
New discoveries and new facts are emerging every year, changing the accepted understanding of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the ‘lost’ first civilisation of Europe that originated in the Balkans.
The ‘Varna Gold’, found relatively recently, in 1972, became a powerful stimulus in the search for this civilisation.
It is logical that something had to precede the golden luxury of Varna: something like a tiny gold bead created in Tell Yunatsite.
