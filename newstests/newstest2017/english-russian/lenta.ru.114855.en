French fashion house, Louis Vuitton, will open a new boutique in Saint Petersburg on 17 September 2016.
It will replace the fashion house's first store, which opened in this city in 2007.
The new boutique will be located on Nevsky Prospekt, a representative for the company told Lenta.ru.
We are pleased to announce the opening of a new store in Saint Petersburg, said Alessandro Valenti, President of Louis Vuitton for Northern Europe, Middle East, and Africa.
Customers can personalise their purchases using hot stamping technology: in honour of the opening, plates with a view of Saint Petersburg were produced that complement the initials of the client.
At the end of the nineteenth century, they designed luggage for the Russian aristocracy: the Grand Duke, Alexander Romanov, the Princess Troubetzkoy, and the imperial family.
Today, they produce clothing, shoes, accessories, jewellery, watches, and have also resumed production of perfumes.
The company is part of the international LVMH group.
