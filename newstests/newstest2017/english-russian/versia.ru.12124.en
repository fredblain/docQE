A decision was made at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will last for two years, until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On 11 August, the Executive Committee of the RFU appointed Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
He is a well-known footballer, who formerly played for Spartak Moscow in the position of goalkeeper, and is also a coach with solid experience, who was the trainer for such Russian teams as the one and very same Spartak, Zhemchuzhina-Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dynamo, and also Legia Warsaw, which won the national championship and the country's cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and that it will last two years.
As such, the responsibility falls on him to prepare the team for the 2018 World Championship.
It's known that Miroslav Romaschenko, Gintaras Staučė, and Vladimir Panikov will be part of his coaching staff.
There is information that suggests that the salaries for the whole coaching staff will amount to 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to media sources, the leadership of the RFU has set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to get the Russian national team to the semi-finals and to win medals.
The coach himself stated that he considers creating a competitive environment on the team as a matter of priority and is going to give the football players an opportunity to prove themselves.
Furthermore, according to Cherchesov, he's happy that he was the one chosen.
The Russian team will have its first match under the direction of Cherchesov on 31 August, in Antalya: it will be a friendly match against the Turkish team.
Recall that the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was previously held by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after a disastrous performance by the Russia national team at Euro 2016 in France.
Having said that, he took personal responsibility for the team's poor showing.
