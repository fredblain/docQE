Is it worth going to a health resort if you don't have any health problems?
Our expert: Head doctor of a health resort, Olga Bogush.
If a person is healthy, but just burnt-out from work, should they bother going to a health resort?
A health resort vacation is essential to us not only in terms of treatment, but also for the prevention of illnesses.
In the setting of a health resort, a person can check the state of their body and receive recommendations from a doctor about how to live so that their health does not fall apart.
These types of recommendations are useful to everyone.
‘I'm just burnt-out from work’, is an important signal from the body that shouldn't be dismissed.
Constant stress and mental and physical exhaustion can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
But about 90% of visitors feel stressed.
Moreover, the people who are most susceptible to it are from large cities and between the ages of 45 and 55.
So, it's best to not compound matters and give yourself time to relax before it’s too late.
Studies show that 98% of people lower their biological age during a stay at a health resort.
Modern health resorts offer a comfortable stay for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend your vacation with the children, you won't have to part ways with them.
Wellness programmes are available for children, even the very youngest, which include not only diagnostic services, consultations with a paediatrician, and tests, but also therapeutic services.
For example: swimming (there are children's pools at many health resorts), inhalation therapy, specialised dietary regimes, massage, oxygen cocktails, and physiotherapy.
A doctor determines a course of treatment taking into account patient-specific indications and the particular characteristics of the growing body.
In addition, health resorts usually offer a children's club with activity coordinators, where children can explore play activities and various workshops.
Some health resorts even open their doors to guests with infants, providing babies with the necessary conditions and offering the services of an experienced nanny.
Mild winters, long summers, and an abundance of sunny days each year (more than 300) create the perfect conditions for year-round recreation at the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
After all, the body needs rest not only during the summertime.
So, there's no need to fear the weather outside, especially since the majority of procedures are conducted indoors and are in no way dependant on the season.
In general, it is advisable to undergo treatment at a health resort 2 times a year, especially for people of a mature age.
The main draw of the Caucasian Mineral Waters region is, of course, its healing mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Yessentuki, and Narzan.
Their waters possess unique properties and act on different systems of the body.
The water differs in terms of temperature, the amount of salt, total mineralisation, and chemical and gas composition.
A doctor chooses the water depending on the patient’s wellbeing.
For example, Narzan has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and repairs the function of the gastrointestinal tract and the metabolism.
Yessentuki-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract and reduces blood sugar levels.
New Yessentuki offers anti-inflammatory, choleretic, and diuretic effects.
The water at Slavyanovsky has the same effect.
When prescribing water treatment, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, they choose water with a lower salt content, because the salts retain liquid, which leads to increased blood pressure.
The consumption of mineral water requires adherence to a regime: the water should be drunk at a particular time, in a required amount, and at a specific temperature.
Nowadays, various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are also available at health resorts.
What kinds of health treatments, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, are available at resorts in the region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is the Tambukan salt lake, the silt mud from which is beneficial for the joints, spine, and internal organs.
It offers anti-inflammatory, resolving, and immunomodulatory effects.
Then there are constitutional walks along individually tailored routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is the huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).
They are popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in close proximity to the Narzan mineral spring.
There, you can also take baths in wine, pearls, iodine-bromine, selenium, and sage-liquorice, depending on what the doctor prescribes for you.
