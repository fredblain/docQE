The Blagoveshchensk City Court (Amur Region) has sentenced the former head of the city, Alexander Migulya, to nine years in a standard regime penal colony.
This was reported on 12 August on the court's website.
Migulya was found guilty of committing crimes established under Articles 286 ('Excess of power'), 285.1 ('Misappropriation of budgetary funds'), and 285 ('Abuse of official powers') of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation established that, in December 2008, the official provided his friend with a plot of land in the village of Mukhinka in violation of established land legislation procedures.
In 2006, he unlawfully issued an ordinance for procurement of a road bridge over the Chigiri River for the city, at an over-inflated price, and without tendering procedures or signing a municipal contract, Interfax clarifies.
Moreover, between 2007 and 2010, Migulya, in the interests of a commercial organisation controlled by him, altered the payment dates of a land lease agreement under a purchase and sale agreement, which was granted for the construction of housing, and also absolved the company from paying rent.
As a result, the regional budget was short-changed more than 5 million roubles and the city treasury was out by about 21 million roubles.
On 4 August, it came to light that the former head of the city was in custody on suspicion of corruption and that he was seeking a seat in parliament, but did not provide the Election Commission with signature sheets for participation in the elections to the State Duma on time, and was removed from the election race.
Migulya was arrested in May 2015, in Lipetsk Region, and was placed in a pre-trial detention facility.
Prior to that, he had been on the international wanted list since 2011.
Alexander Migulya held the post of mayor of Blagoveshchensk from November 2004 until April 2010.
