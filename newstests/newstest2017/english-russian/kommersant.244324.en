The largest M&A deal in the pension market has gotten underway: KIT Finance Pension Administrator has launched the process of combining four Non-State Pension Funds (NPF) under its control.
As a result, an NPF with savings of around 373 billion roubles will be created on the basis of Gazfond Pension Savings.
The launch of the merger of the four pension funds – KIT Finance, Promagrofond, Nasledie, and Gazfond Pension Savings – was reported yesterday by the 100% owner of the funds, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, LLC.
‘The reorganisation is being carried out in coordination with the Central Bank, and in compliance with the requirement that there be no deterioration in the terms of existing contracts’, says a company statement.
The merger is being carried out on the basis of Gazfond Pension Savings.
As noted by the CEO of this NPF, Oleg Byaloshitsky, the merging of the funds makes it possible to solve several problems: expand geographical presence, pool resources for development, reduce costs, replicate the best practices of each of the funds, and improve corporate management.
According to him, the approximate completion date for the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger, NPF Gazfond Pension Savings will become the largest player in the compulsory pension insurance market.
As of 31 March, the volume of pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion roubles.
Based on the financials on the website of the funds, Anatoly Gavrilenko (who owns 65% through a controlled LLC) and NPF Gazfond (35%) are the current beneficiaries of their owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator.
However, the merger of this group was launched much later than its competitors.
For example, NPF Future, under the control of O1 Group, absorbed Stalfond back at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF is absorbing the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
‘Merging into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary for solving structural problems’, notes the CEO of NPF Future, Nikolay Sidorov.
The Safmar pension group has been engaged in active efforts aimed at consolidating funds since April: the European, Education and Science, and Regionfond NPFs should join the ranks of NPF Safmar by the end of this year.
In 2017, NPF Doverie will join them.
‘Merging the funds will have the effect of improving risk control, operational processes, and costs’, the Safmar pension group noted.
The pause in merging funds that KIT Finance Pension Administrator took could have been caused by several factors, experts say.
Until recently, NPFs could not redeem more than 40% of the volume of an issue of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively involved.
After amendments were made to the Central Bank resolution in March of this year, there are no longer any such restrictions for a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, an entire issue can be redeemed by one big player’, says Yury Nogin, Director of the Financial Institutions Ratings Group at ACRA.
Several heads of the top-15 NPFs by assets named the division of spheres of influence, and, as a result, the appointment of staff in a single fund, which had to be agreed to by the owners of the group, as yet another possible reason for the pause.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko could not be reached for comment.
NPF Gazfond also did not respond to Kommersant's request.
Although the consolidation of funds is a time-consuming and expensive affair, this decision will be justified in the long run.
Sergei Kolesnov, CEO of the consulting firm, Pension Partner, notes that Gazfond Pension Savings has fewer outflows, so the accession will help to stabilise the base of the group's other funds.
Moreover, the successful experience of NPFs, KIT Finance and Promagrofond, in generating retail sales of compulsory pension insurance and in using more modern software, will be in demand.
The Central Bank's requirements for the activities and personnel of NPFs are constantly growing, so it is impractical to duplicate the infrastructure of the four funds given their unified investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director of Corporate Ratings at Expert RA.
‘The effect of cutting out duplicate functions will definitely cover the potential costs of the merger’, notes Mr Mitrofanov.
Sergei Okolesnov estimates the cost of merging the four funds at between 30-50 million roubles.
‘The cost of maintaining four funds of these sizes amounts to about 400 million roubles a year, so, in the medium term, the consolidation will actually cut the budget by half’, Mr Okolesnov assured.
