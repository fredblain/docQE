The process of naturalisation of athletes, which has recently taken-off in Russian football and was well established in the winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, is still not as extensively developed in summer sports.
If former foreigners are also competing for Russia at the Olympic Games in Rio, then in the majority of cases, we are talking about natives of countries that were former republics of the Soviet Union.
However, in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process: a sufficiently large number of Russians are competing under the flags of other states.
In each case, the story behind the change of nationality is different.
Some were brought to a different country by their parents during childhood, leaving no choice.
Some couldn't successfully compete for a spot on the Russian team.
While some thought that there would be better conditions to improve in their sport abroad.
AiF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In the German passport of the 27-year-old girl, it is written that her name is Lisa Ryzih.
Previously, however, it was, of course, Elizaveta.
She was born in 1988, in the city of Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to immigrate to Germany.
The young girl didn't have a choice.
There, she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister and pursue track and field.
Just like her sister, Lisa chose pole vaulting.
If she had stayed in Russia, it is doubtful she could have ‘usurped the thrown’ of Yelena Isinbayeva.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio, Lisa will be the only one of our countrywomen, even if only a former one, in the pole vault event.
Her highest achievements in this sport are bronze at the 2010 European Championships and silver at the continental competition in 2016, which she won, once again, amidst Yelena Isinbayeva's absence.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious proselytisers of an evangelical branch.
For the most part, they left for the United States, because of their religion, when the young girl was just three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena already started to get involved in wrestling in school.
Producing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where she continued to practice at the US Training Centre for Wrestling, under the guidance of another former Russian citizen, Vladislav Izboinikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her very first fight.
But then, at the World Championships that same year, she had a victory.
Prior to this, in fact, she managed to win silver at the World Championships in 2010.
After this, there was a bronze in 2013 and a silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first became acquainted with synchronised swimming.
However, it wouldn't be right to say that our coaches in Russia trained her.
Soon afterwards, the girl's family decided to immigrate to the United States and settle down in the city of Colorado.
Maria continued her training there.
Soon thereafter, she joined the US team and made an excellent showing at the Pan American Games.
Of course, she couldn't compete at the intensive international level of Russian synchronised swimming, but for America, her results were at the very top.
Kristen Shaldybin, which sounds odd in Russian, received her new name at 11 years of age, when her parents decided to continue the girl's training in rhythmic gymnastics overseas.
Up to that point, the girl was engaged in her favourite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Having immigrated to the United States, she quickly joined that country's youth team, and later also pushed her way into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
Of course, she wasn't in contention for first place on the world stage, but she staged a real breakthrough for the United States, taking the team of stars and stripes into the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another one of our former ‘rhythmic gymnasts’ is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who competes for Team Germany.
Jana was born in Tolyatti.
In 2008, when the girl was only 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany: there, the girl had a better chance of making it onto the national team.
It didn't take long before she was representing her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, however, Jana was only able to take 17th place, which was not enough to get into the final competition in the individual event.
On the other hand, in the two years prior to this, she, in fact, managed to win a bronze medal at the Youth Olympic Games.
There is another gymnast, but this time, an artistic gymnast: Irina Sazonova.
If the immigration route of the already-mentioned gymnasts could be called conventional, then the choice of Irina's family was very unusual: Iceland.
Ira is an alumna of a Volgograd sport school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became national champion.
Truth be told, Ira still trains in Russia: she comes home specifically so that she doesn't lose her skills.
In Rio, she didn't perform as well as she would have liked.
Her best placing was 40th in the individual all-around.
There is extremely little information about the swimmer, Maria Ugolkova, in the Russian infosphere.
Maria has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for quite a long time, she was competing under the Russian flag and producing some decent results: there was even a national record in the 200 metre butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and started competing under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance was 14th place in the 4x100 m freestyle relay.
In order to get to the Games, the girl started a crowdfunding project, through which she managed to collect around 6,000 francs, which enabled her to pay for her preparations for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle wrestler, Adam Batirov, spent virtually his entire career under the Russian flag.
During that time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, Russian champion, and an international class Master of Sports of Russia.
When he stopped making it onto our national team, the time had come to start thinking about changing nationality.
For several years, the talented fighter disappeared from the sporting podium.
His triumphant comeback happened at the 2016 Asian Championships: Batirov was already representing Bahrain, for whom he won a gold medal and got a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
Back home, there is even less known about another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, than about Swiss swimmer, Maria Ugolkova.
The fact of the matter is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It is there that Mikhail started to get involved in artistic gymnastics.
He didn't achieve great success at the international level.
In Rio, his best performance was 40th place in the qualification round on the parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympics in artistic gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Nastya, who was born in Moscow in 1985, was just 9 years old, her family immigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued to train in synchronised swimming, performing very well at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronised swimming.
In a duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo programme.
Just like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kroyter competes for Team Israel.
When the boy was just 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry had already become national champion.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Kroyter also won gold at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to high jump, Dmitry also does long jump and triple jump.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Khasavyurt, who, after a long time of competing for Russia, decided to switch his sport nationality.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, whom he will also represent in Rio.
In Russia, he competed for the School of Higher Sports Mastery in Krasnoyarsk, and, in 2011, even became national champion.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow into the family of a member of the USSR's volleyball team, Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognised as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon thereafter, he decided to continue his career in Italy.
There, the family remained as permanent residents.
In 2015, as a part of the national team, he became the bronze medal winner at the European Championships, which were held in his new homeland.
Khadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994, and got stuck with his family in the midst of the war.
After ten years, his parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it wasn't possible to get into this northern country, and they had to go to France, to Nice.
There, Zelimkhan continued to study freestyle wrestling.
Soon thereafter, he won the Junior World Championship, and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative for France in the wrestling tournament.
And once again it's freestyle wrestling, and once again it's a former Russian citizen.
But this time, the story is about a native of North Ossetia who immigrated to Spain: it's about Taimuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and, currently, he competes for this country's national team.
Before this, of course, the 30-year-old athlete also managed to produce very good results in Russia.
He became the bronze medal winner at the National Championships in 2007 and 2008.
Tired of not making it onto the team, Taimuraz decided to change sports nationality.
The last on our list is a Chechen boxer, Arthur Biyarslanov, born in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, in 1995.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, started to box.
Since then, Arthur has become Canadian Champion three times over, and, in 2012, he became the World Youth Champion.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won gold at the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.
