WSJ: The United States is considering imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation over the hacking of the Democrats' servers.
US officials are considering imposing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of the Democratic Party's servers, writes The Wall Street Journal, citing sources.
According to reports, in order to impose sanctions, the administration of President Barack Obama will need to officially accuse Russia of attacking the servers or hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other American intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia's involvement in the cyberattack.
The WSJ notes that, generally, the United States prefers not to specifically name those who carry out cyberattacks.
An exception was the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainmentâ€™s database in 2014, the responsibility for which was officially placed on the DPRK.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions against those who engage in or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally aimed against China, but it can also be used against other countries.
The sanctions decision-making process could be lengthy, the newspaper writes.
Even if officials come to the conclusion that the hackers were supported by Russia, they will need to weigh the possible consequences before a decision on the disclosure of such information is made.
They will need to determine if the incident is serious enough for them to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier, it was reported that the Obama administration is considering the possibility of applying sanctions against the state whose hackers broke into the servers of the National Committee of the Democratic Party.
The website, WikiLeaks, published the email correspondence of the Democratic National Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities might be involved in the hack.
The Kremlin has called such reports absurd.
