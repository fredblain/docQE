The souped-up Mercedes-Benz G class, whose improvements are aimed at achieving very high performance, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confound the experts at the company, G-Power, who tackled the redesign of the sport version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its proclivity for BMW vehicles, but, at the end of the day, to their experts, a vehicle is a vehicle.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63: a 571-hp flying sledgehammer, with the aerodynamics of a tank, that goes from zero to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
To beef up the ‘muscles’ of this crazy ‘Gelik’, the experts took advantage of the benefits offered by the 5.5-litre supercharged V8 engine.
Well, the speed at which it accelerates from zero to a hundred improved by an indiscernible 0.1 second: now the flying ‘brick’ is capable of hitting 100 in 5.3 seconds.
Mind you, acceleration at average speeds is, for sure, discernibly easier for it.
The top speed is terrifying: while the standard G 63 can't go faster than 210 km/h, the souped-up SUV, with a deactivated electronic ‘collar’, is capable of hitting 250 km/h.
From the outside, the vehicle is almost indistinguishable from the factory original, with the exception of different wheel rims: 23-inch Hurricane RR with 305/35ZR23 size tyres.
The luxury division, Mercedes-Maybach, has announced a striking, 6-metre-long concept coupe, which will be unveiled at the Concours d'Elegance in Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz intends to compete with the ‘green sub-brand’, BMW i, and will promote their electric models under a separate brand.
In the coming years, the debut of at least four new eco-friendly models is expected.
