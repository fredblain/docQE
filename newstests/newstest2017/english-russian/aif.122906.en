Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs that Russia is emerging from the longest recession of the past twenty years.
As noted by the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, Russia's GDP is showing improvement: in the second quarter, GDP declined by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure represents the smallest decline since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, Russia's economic contraction slowed to 0.6% in the second quarter.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade also recently spoke about the stabilising situation.
Slow growth ahead.
According to experts from the Central Bank of Russia, the Russian economic recession is a thing of the past.
‘The index rating of Russia's GDP indicates that the recession is behind us, and that slow economic growth is ahead’, says a bulletin from the Bank of Russia called ‘What the trends indicate’.
Experts from the regulatory authority increased the GDP estimate model for the current quarter to 0.4%, while the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade reported that Russia's GDP stopped contracting in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted decline in GDP amounted to 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But over the course of the quarter, the decline stopped: it amounted to 0.2% in April, while in May and June, the change in GDP was within the range of 0-0.15%’, RIA Novosti quotes the spokesperson from the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade as saying.
The slowdown in the rate of contraction of the Russian economy over the past five quarters suggests that the ‘bottom has already been passed’.
Bloomberg names the growth in demand for electricity and rail transport, as well as the revival of business among other markers that point to signs of recovery in the national economy.
If you take into account the fact that it's a leap year, it is clear that the trend of a 1% increase in the consumption of electricity can be partially attributed to the additional workday.
Then, we'll factor in the colder than average annual temperatures in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight traffic, but here it's difficult to obtain accurate data, and an increase or decrease of 0.5% in semi-annual volume could also be explained by seasonal factors’, explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
On the other hand, there are other more obvious signs of stabilisation of the Russian economy.
For example, a decline in price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index amounted to 7.2%, compared to 15.6% for the same month last year.
Moreover, Rosstat has recorded deflation over the past two weeks.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamic of the rouble exchange rate, despite displaying high volatility at the beginning of the year, it strengthened by 12% between the beginning of the year and August.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which indicators in the real economy should follow’, underscores Yakovenko.
In addition to this, since April, there has been growth in the volume of industrial output in the Russian Federation.
In June, this figure rose by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover has slowed from -32.8% in January 2016, to -20.7% in May.
A positive trend is also evident in the labour market, where the rate of unemployment fell to 5.4%.
The only time it has been lower was in September 2015 (5.2%).
In spite of the favourable situation in the labour market, the issue of real disposable incomes leaves a lot to be desired.
In annual terms, this figure has declined by 4.8%.
This factor could slow down the economic recovery, given that household spending represents a sizeable contribution to GDP.
As a rule, its share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50%.
In addition to weak consumption, the Bank of Russia's strict policy could also be mentioned in terms of other risk factors for economic growth.
The regulatory authority has held rates at 10.5%, which doesn't have the best impact on the real sector.
Inadequate levels of investment are also a negative factor, as this hinders development of industrial capacity.
Overall, however, we can assume that by the end of the year, the rate of decline in the Russian economy will slow to -0.5%, compared to -3.7% in 2015’, says Irina Rogova, an analyst with Forex Club.
