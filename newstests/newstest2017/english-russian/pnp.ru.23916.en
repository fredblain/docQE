Turkish oppositionist, Fethullah Gülen, calls for an international investigation into the circumstances surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey.
‘I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt’, the French newspaper, Le Monde, quotes Gülen as saying.
The Turkish oppositionist also said that, ‘if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey’.
Gülen, however, wholeheartedly denies involvement in the coup, stressing that his organisation has never aspired to political power.
Earlier, the Istanbul Court issued an in absentia arrest warrant for the oppositionist Islamic preacher, Fethullah Gülen.
Recall that a military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of the 15-16 of July.
