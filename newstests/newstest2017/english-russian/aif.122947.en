Housing and communal services continue to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There is evidence of misappropriation of funds that are earmarked for public utilities from budgets at various levels.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, artificially high prices are one of the most common crimes in the sphere of housing and communal services.
As a result, consumers in the region overpaid power suppliers by more than 170 million roubles.
The other day, the Prosecutor's Office for Krasnodar Krai also became aware of the fact that unjustified costs were included in the prices.
While the expenses of OOO IV-Consulting (supplies cold water) show that 4 million roubles were spent hiring cars at above-market prices.
And there are a host of examples like this throughout the country.
The people are handing over their last rouble to ‘public utilities’ and, what's more, they are paying in a timely manner: according the Ministry of Construction, Housing, and Utilities of the Russian Federation, the average collection rate is 94% of the population.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code at once: embezzlement, money laundering, abuse of power, and so forth.
According to investigators, as head of a fund that was involved in the repair of city facilities, Makarov entered into contracts with business owners who did not actually perform work, but were still paid.
The businessmen simply returned a large portion of the money to him.
While, as the owner of a property management company, Makarov collected money from the population, but didn't pay service providers and used the money for his own purposes.
As a result, damages to the budget and residents are in the millions of roubles.
Makarov's fraudulent scheme is sadly typical of Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of directors of property management companies, who embezzled citizens' money, has swept across the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kokhan continues; incidentally, he is also a former city council member and is accused of fraud amounting to 91.7 million roubles.
According to investigators, between 2012 and 2013, he established 6 property management companies and created 3 limited liability companies in Elizovo in Kamchatka Krai.
One of them carried out contractual work for a property management company, while the other two played the role of payment processing centres, that is, they took money from the population.
However, A. Kokhan never transferred the funds to the power suppliers, but spent it on his precious self.
It's fairly difficult to litigate in the housing and communal services sector.
Cases aren't opened or drag on.
And very complicated housing legislation ‘helps’ with this, figures Svetlana Razvorotneva, Executive Director of the non-profit partnership, Housing Control.
We don't have time to start working on one law, before we devise a new one that is necessary to get the previous one to work.
There are also too few experts, including judges, in the area of housing and communal services.
Lawyers themselves acknowledge that housing law is given very little attention at universities.
Refusals to initiate criminal proceedings and red tape during investigations are even reported in the Prosecutor General's Office.
Of the 3,500 pending criminal cases in 2015, less than half made it to trial.
In the rest of the cases, the investigations took on a protracted nature, and every fifth case was suspended in connection with failure to identify the accused party.
It is not uncommon that mistakes made by law enforcement officials are written off by them on gaps in the current legislation.
The law exists, but inquiry bodies are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of forgery, but only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In the first 5 months of this year, their number has only slightly increased to 99.
But what is meant by the falsification of tenants meeting minutes?
It means: a change in the management of the building, and financial and other issues that circumvent the opinion of the owners.
But it also means that ordinary companies, that want to work honestly and don't ‘milk’ the population, can't break into the housing and communal services market.
It turns out that tenants are losing out, and so are small and medium businesses.
Primarily, due to the eradication of corruption, in and of itself, throughout the state, assures Anton Zharkov, a member of the Duma Committee on property issues.
And currently, this work is actively underway.
It's not just isolated actions: it's a deliberate policy of fighting corruption.
Of course, not all regions are in such a sad state.
In particular, there are no signs of scandal in the capital.
Why are there no such scandals in the housing and communal services sector in Moscow, as there are in many other regions?
Well, because the city government has shown an iron will and has established order, Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the Duma Committee for security and combating corruption, told AiF.
I am referring to personnel issues, legislative amendments, and legal education.
Close supervision of property management companies has been instituted and they have all gone through the licensing process.
Citizens' complaints are dealt with promptly and in full public view (and the appeals of residents and responsive measures are posted on the internet portal of the Government of Moscow).
Many people not only pay their monthly bills, but also keep a close eye on what is written on them, and how the building is being maintained.
The public's awareness about the rights of owners and the responsibilities of resource-supplying and property management organisations is very high.
Plus, Moscow checks the reasonableness of rates for housing and communal services, because a sizeable portion of budgetary funds goes towards subsidies and benefits for a multitude of population categories.
Probably, all of this is what explains the calm situation in Moscow.
So, it turns out that everything depends on the will of regional authorities?
Perhaps the weak-willed should change jobs?
