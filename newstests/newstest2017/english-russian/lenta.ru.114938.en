The British jewellery house, Graff, has unveiled a new watch model, The Peacock Watch, which is made in the shape of a peacock feather, Vogue reports.
The watchcase is decorated with loose diamonds.
To accomplish this, the jewellers used not only classic round stones, but also baguettes, as well as bespoke-cut trapezoidal and emerald-cut diamonds.
This watch, with quartz movement and the dark blue hands characteristic of the Graff design, was created in a single copy and is on display at the Mercury boutique in the Moscow Four Seasons Hotel.
The publication did not name its price.
Graff is a jewellery and watch house founded in 1960, in London, by Laurence Graff.
They make jewellery with precious stones, mostly diamonds (including coloured diamonds) and watches (since 2008).
It is a four-time winner of the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the field of international trade (1977, 1994, 2006, 2014).
Over the years, Graff has acquired extremely rare and valuable diamonds, notably: the pink Empress Rose, the Star of America, the Sarah, and others.
