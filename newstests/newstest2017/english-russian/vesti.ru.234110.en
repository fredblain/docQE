Facebook and ad blockers have unleashed an ‘arms race’
Facebook's recent introduction of a technology, which prevents the hiding of advertisements on pages of the social network, has sparked a tit-for-tat response from developers of ad-blocking technologies.
AdBlock Plus has released an ‘antidote’, but Facebook plans on making even this useless before long.
So, AdBlock Plus advertised their new technology, which is unlikely to remain effective for long
Representatives from the social network noted that, in an effort circumvent the new technology of ‘unblockable’ advertisements, AdBlock Plus' technology also blocks regular posts from friends and pages in addition to commercials.
Facebook expressed regret about the policy of AdBlock Plus and promised to fix the problem shortly.
A source within the developers of the social network told the publication, ‘TechCrunch’, that a code, which will make AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop version of Facebook, will be ready within the next few hours.
In this way, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of ‘arms race’, trying to one-up each other: the aggrieved party turned out to be the users, who missed interesting posts from their friends or saw advertisements where they weren't used to seeing them.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertisements have caused heated arguments as of late.
