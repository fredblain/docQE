The kindest Disney film, ‘Pete's Dragon’, has been released in Russia.
The beautiful views of New Zealand, the adorable dragon, the sentimental story, and the country music songs are enough to make one believe in good old-fashioned magic once again, says ELENA KRAVTSUN.
The dragon finds the frightened boy, becoming both a gentle caregiver and loyal friend to the young human.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honour of a puppy from a book of fairy tales, plays tag with him, and falls asleep in his embrace.
Six years later, with a beard and in a loincloth, he is indistinguishable from that other clever forest rascal, Mowgli.
It is in this state that he is found by the redheaded huntress, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while a team led by Gavin (Karl Urban), the brother of her husband, is aggressively clearing the forest.
Now, she is faced not only with believing that the dragon exists, but also with helping to save him.
Pete goes through a crash course in ‘being human’, surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, live according to a moral code, and smile more brightly than in any advertising.
None of the characters look or act too horribly for the audience to really start to hate or fear them.
Even Gavin, who unleashes a hunt for the unusual inhabitant of the woods under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The huge fluffy dragon also turned out to be anything but frightening, with the sweet muzzle of a bulldog, the wingspan of an airplane, and the power of invisibility.
The dragon amusingly grunts, purrs, and even snorts, but, thankfully, does not speak; although, the whole time, you want to be petting him, and it is in this sense that he has an obvious advantage over all the other known cinematic dragons.
The visual representation of Elliot and his mannerisms create such a high degree of emotional involvement that, in the most intense moments, it's not only the young members of the audience who start desperately bawling their eyes out, but also the adults.
The young Oakes Fegley is also surprisingly good in the role of Pete: torn between his potential family and a true friend.
While Robert Redford masterfully plays the iconic grandfather, whom literally every child would be glad to have.
How did Director David Lowery manage to shoot a fantastically lovable remake of the forgotten Disney film, ‘Pete's Dragon’ (1977), – which was mediocre from start to finish and only remembered for combining animation and live-action film – and turn it into this summer's most heartwarming film?
Nothing short of a miracle would have helped.
Lowry, in fact, only took two things from the original for his film: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
The musical numbers and most of the odd jokes were thrown overboard.
Features drawn from ‘Bambi’, ‘E.T.’, and many other cherished children's films can be seen in this kind-hearted tale.
Disney Studios continues to successfully expand their gallery of high-quality 21st century remakes.
Of course, ‘Pete's Dragon’ is not as stunningly beautiful as ‘The Jungle Book’, and there is no cunning villain, such as Cate Blanchett turned out to be in the role of the stepmother in the new ‘Cinderella’.
But this simple-hearted film, in keeping with the best traditions of Disney, is no less successful in helping one to believe in miracles and goodness.
In fact, Director Lowry will get the keys to Disney's magic castle once again for an artistic film adaptation of the story of ‘Peter Pan’.
The tandem of David Lowery and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks, tried and tested during ‘Pete's Dragon’, has entered into an ambitious new project about the boy who never grew up from James Barrie's fairy tale by the same name.
