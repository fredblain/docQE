In Miass (Chelyabinsk Region), Konstantin Akulich, the lawyer for the former Vice Governor, Nikolai Sandakov, has been detained.
Another lawyer for the accused, Sergei Kolosovsky, told Kommersant-South Ural that Konstantin Akulich was summoned to the Miass branch of the Investigative Committee of Russia today for arraignment on a year-old battery case.
At that time, Konstantin Akulich arrived at the scene of a traffic accident, in the capacity of a lawyer, to assist one of the parties to the accident.
‘Initially, it was filed against unidentified persons. Then, after he began to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akulich’, says Sergei Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akulich became the ex-vice governor's lawyer at the beginning of August.
Moreover, half an hour before calling the lawyer into the Investigative Committee of Russia in Miass, the defence was notified that the deadline for familiarisation with materials in the case of fraud against Nikolai Sandakov was on Monday.
To recall, two criminal cases were brought against Nikolai Sandakov.
In the first (the fraud case), he is charged with promising to assist in appointing Evgeny Tarasov, Head of the Administration for Ozersk, to the post of mayor of Magnitogorsk for 1.5 million roubles.
The second criminal case concerns bribes that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from Igor Kalugin, the director of the private security company, Python, in the form of property-related services worth no less than 1.3 million roubles, which were provided illegally at no charge.
