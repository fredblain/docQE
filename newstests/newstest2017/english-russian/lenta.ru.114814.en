Thus, in the area of Tochigi Prefecture, the traffic jam spanned for 43 kilometres, while in Kanagawa Prefecture, it was 33 kilometres.

Starting on 11 August 2016, Japan celebrates Mountain Day and the holiday is considered an official day off.
Afterwards, many Japanese head to their home city for a few days.
The Japanese people's short break will last until at least Tuesday of next week, and that is when a new peak in traffic jams is expected.
In Japan, it is considered bad form to take a full vacation.
By law, citizens are allotted 18 vacation days per year, but most of them limit themselves to a week.
