The expected timeframe for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is between the end of August and the beginning of September.
But this won't lead to a spike in demand, since the core market, families with children, are already getting ready for school, experts point out.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies sent a letter to the government yesterday with a request to now allow charters.
‘For many Russian tourists, selecting affordable, quality seaside vacations is still an unresolved issue, because, in the resort towns of Krasnodar Krai and the Republic of Crimea, the majority of accommodation facilities are already booked up until the end of September’, note the authors of the letter, while emphasising that the establishment of charter operations in August would not significantly affect existing demand for Russian seaside tourism products.
The North-West Division Office of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (RUTI) has reported that, if aviation authorities in Russia and Turkey are able to come to a decision quickly, then the resumption of charter flights to Turkey could be expected within a month.
There is still no clear understanding of when charters will resume; it ultimately depends on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes could start flying in September, even in August, if tour operators quickly put together packages and reach an agreement with airline companies regarding the required flight paths’, says said Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects for the North-West Division Office of RUTI.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but it won't seriously affect the balance of power in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are getting ready for school or are spending their holidays in other countries.
In the autumn season, tours are mainly purchased by individual travellers or couples.
Charter packages can count on those who have the ability to spontaneously take a vacation’, says Pavel Rumyantsev.
‘Turkey has a chance to attract lots of tourists if it provides very budget-friendly offers – 50-60 thousand roubles for a trip for two – because there are people who intentionally wait for very cheap tours’, says Valery Rosenthal, CEO of Optio-Travel travel agency.
Otherwise, there's no sense in counting on a buying frenzy; the majority of travel has already been planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that, because there is demand for scheduled flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but there is no sense in expecting a buying frenzy.
‘For Turkey, the launch of charters right now is a rehearsal for next season’, says Pavel Rumyantsev.
‘The establishment of charters to Turkey is good news for the next season’, agrees Valeriya Rubtsova.
