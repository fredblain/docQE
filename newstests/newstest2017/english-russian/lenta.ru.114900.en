The authorities of the French city of Cannes have banned visiting local beaches in a burkini: a special bathing suit for women that completely covers the body from the head to the ankles.
ABC News reported this on Friday, 12 August.
The Mayor of Cannes, David Lisnard, explained that this type of clothing ‘ignores the rules of decorum, the principles of secularism, and does not adhere to standards of hygiene and safety’.
Furthermore, according to him, clothing that emphasises religious affiliation may incite disturbances of the peace.
Wearing a burkini will result in a fine in the amount of 38 euros (approximately 42 dollars).
It should be noted that the ban is being imposed against the backdrop of terrorist attacks that occurred on 15 July in Nice and on 26 July in a church in the city of Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray, in the north of the country.
After its introduction, several Muslim women went to court, claiming that the restrictions violate the right to freedom of religion.
