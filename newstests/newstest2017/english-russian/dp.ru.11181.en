The HACCP system has been mandatory for food services for more than a year already, but it still hasn't been implemented in the majority of cafes and restaurants in Saint Petersburg.
Inspections are becoming more prevalent and a business faces fines of up to 1 million roubles.
For more than a year already, conformance with the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP, KhASSP in the Russian version) – an analysis of risks and critical control points – has been mandatory for manufacturers and transporters of food, as well as for companies in the field of food services in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU).
In Saint Petersburg, inspections of businesses, by Rospotrebnadzor, for compliance with these standards started in February 2015.
But so far, officials are only issuing fines for specific violations of the rules (see ‘The List of Documents’...).
Failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost a company 600,000 roubles for the first violation and 1 million roubles for the second.
HACCP was developed in the United States in the 1960s as a system that takes into account the risks of working with food and how to prevent them.
At that time, the issue at stake was the safety of food for astronauts.
Today, the system is used in all food enterprises, not only in United States, but also in Canada and in the European Union.
HACCP has been in force within the CU since February 2015.
Businesses were given 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HACCP requirement first appeared in the technical regulations of the CU in 2011).
However, both business owners themselves and officials acknowledge that the majority of companies have not even heard about this standard.
Unfortunately, for a long time, we were convinced that the standard only applied to food production and not restaurateurs, explained Elena Tsereteli, Head of the Public Council.
Now, everyone is trying to make up for lost time.
