A WTO panel of arbitrators has found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators, and palm oil contravene the rules of the organisation.
The import rate is in excess of commitments assumed by Russia upon accession to the WTO.
'This is the first time that the WTO has decided against Russia', says a statement on the official website of the organisation.
However, the arbitrators pointed out in their conclusion that the EU has not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures â€˜were systematic' or 'were overarching in nature'.
Russia, in turn, has promised to adjust import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is noted in a statement from the Russian Ministry of Economic Development and Trade.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organisation about Russia's actions, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in a complaint from the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the behaviour of the United States during the resolution of disputes through the WTO undermines the organisation's accepted principles of discussion.
Similar statements were made by Brazil, Japan, the EU, and other WTO members, because of the Americans' refusal to approve South Korean judge, Seung Wha Chang, for a second term.
As a consequence, Russia will not make an appeal to the WTO regarding the issue of Western sanctions introduced against Russia.
The WTO is an international organisation, founded in January 1995, for the liberalisation of international trade.
Currently, it consists of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
