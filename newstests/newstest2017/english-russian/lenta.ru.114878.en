Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed hope that Anton Vaino, as the new chief of the administration of the head of state, will contribute to its constructive work.
As reported by RIA Novosti, the Russian leader made a corresponding statement at a meeting with Vaino and his predecessor, Sergei Ivanov.
The Russian leader noted that Vaino was recommended by Ivanov himself as a candidate for the position of head of the Presidential Executive Office.
Putin praised the latter for the work accomplished.
On 12 August, Putin removed Ivanov from the post of chief of the administration of the head of state.
Vaino has taken his place in this post.
