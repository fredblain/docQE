Dongfeng will bring the Fengguang 370 crossvan and the Rich New pickup truck to Russia – Za Rulem website www.zr.ru
The Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is representative of a class of automobiles, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover, which is gaining popularity in China.
Another new model announced for Russia is the Rich New pickup truck.
Many Western companies decided to ignore the Moscow International Motor Show this year, so Chinese companies will fill up the empty spaces at Crocus Expo's exhibition halls.
In particular, a strong showing will be made by the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has big plans for the Russian market and intends to offer our car enthusiasts a number of interesting new models in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossvan, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (slightly less than 550 thousand roubles at the current exchange rate).
It's doubtful that Russian citizens will every see it at that price, and the issue of delivery into our country is still in the discussion stage.
In China, by the way, the Fengguang 370 managed to take 11th place on the list of best-selling minivans according to June sales, even though, given its high ground clearance (175 mm) and protective, plastic lower-body moulding, it could also be classified as a crossover.
The crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the older Fengguang 360 model: the 370 has the same wheelbase, 2,725 mm, but its body is slightly longer (4,565 mm to 4,510 mm), it has a more solid design, and is better equipped.
The interior is decorated with wood panelling, but a photo showing a large vertical touch screen, ‘like a Tesla’, in the centre console was only included in the early exhibition models of the crossvan, whereas the ‘sound system’ in vehicles for sale is more basic.
Five of the seven seats easily fold to produce a flat loading area with a length of 1,650 mm, while the maximum trunk capacity is 1,500 L.
The Fengguang 370 is fitted with just one 1.5 L gasoline ‘aspirated’ engine, with 115 hp of output, connected to a 5-speed manual transmission.
The manufacturer is coyly silent about the performance qualities of the car, but promises to be merciful on the owner's budget with an appetite of just 6.7 L/100 km.
The Rich New pickup truck is familiar to Russians as the previous generation Nissan NP300 Navara, but with a design that has been slightly refined by Chinese stylists.
In spite of the outdated design, this model still enjoys a steady demand among Chinese consumers as a reliable and low-maintenance ‘workhorse’.
At a similar price, the Rich New will surely be of interest to Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
The Rich New comes equipped with two choices of engines: a 2.4 L gasoline engine (137 hp) or a 2.5 L turbodiesel engine (116 hp).
It only comes in a standard transmission with rear-wheel drive, but there are upgrades and an option of part-time 4WD.
The new flagship A9 sedan will also be at the Dongfeng booth; a representative from the Chinese company announced its Russian premiere back in June.
There are increasingly more minivan-type crossovers in the Chinese market; some of the latest new models are the Cowin V3 and the X7 SWM.
Currently, Dongfeng's Russian line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
Over the first seven months of this year, dealers for the Chinese company sold 696 vehicles in our country.
