Extending the fruiting period.
What can be done to make the harvest last until the end of the season?
Yuliya Belopukhova, an agronomist and dacha dweller, explains.
It's time to give those tall tomato plants a trim: remove the new shoots, cut off the top of the plant, and remove all the leaves up to the second-to-last cluster with fruit and blossoms with small young fruit – they won't have time to ripen.
We top-dress all tomatoes, regardless of their ‘type’, as well as peppers and eggplant, with an ash-superphosphate extract and treat them with biologicals (Dozrevatel, to speed up the ripening and growth of the fruit; Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Baktofit, to ward off diseases; Immunotsitofit, to strengthen immunity; and Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocide, Fitoverm, if there are pests).
At the end of summer, the only chemical products that should be used are copper sulphate, colloidal sulphur, and insecticidal soap.
We do the final watering of the plants.
In the greenhouse, we lower the long climbing cucumbers from the trellis so that the lower bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) is laying on the ground, then we water it with a warm water and Zircon solution, and cover the stem in 5-7 cm of compost.
Extending the fruiting period of squash is also easy: cut off the old leaves, water it with warm water and a multinutrient fertiliser solution, and add some nutrient-rich soil under the bush.
To protect against night-time cold, drape material over the garden bed.
Keep the plants uncovered during the day, but cover them after sunset.
