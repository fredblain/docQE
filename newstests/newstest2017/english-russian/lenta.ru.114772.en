A Moscow Region court has arrested a father for the murder of his foster daughter: Investigation and trial: Law enforcement agencies: Lenta.ru
The Ozersk City Court in Moscow Region ordered the arrest of Roman Chernikov, who confessed to the murder of his six-year-old foster daughter.
The court's press secretary, Nina Zhilkina, spoke about this on Thursday, 11 August, as reported by Moscow City News Agency.
‘The court has granted a request by investigative authorities for a pre-trial restraining order against Chernikov in the form of detention for two months’, she said.
Chernikov will be held in custody until 9 October.
On 11 August, the Department of the Investigative Committee of Russia for Moscow Region reported that the foster parents and grandmother of the six-year-old girl confessed to her murder.
Specifically, Roman Chernikov said that he committed the child's murder at home on a day in April 2016, as a result of personal enmity and under the influence of alcohol.
Then, in an effort to conceal the child's body, he burned it and, together with his wife, scattered the remains over a large area.
On the evening of 9 August, in an interrogation with an investigator, the foster parents reported that, in April 2016, the six-year-old child had drowned in the bathtub.
They were able to hide the girl's disappearance from everyone for a long time; however, in August, knowing that staff from child protection services would soon be paying them a home visit, they decided to tell everyone that the child had gone missing.
The parents stated that, on 6 August of that year, their foster daughter voluntarily left the site of the house where the family lived and disappeared.
