The flagship boutique of Frame Moscow's chain of stores for luxury men's clothing and accessories opened following renovations, with a completely revamped design and range of products, a representative from the chain told Lenta.ru.
Only natural materials – walnut, brass, ceramic granite, and glass tinted in a wood tone – were used in the design of the space, said the representative for Frame.
The multimedia window displays play on the balance between tradition and cutting-edge technology.
The multi-brand Frame Moscow stores feature Marol shirts, bags and briefcases from Serapian, Jacob Cohen designer jeans, cufflinks and bracelets from Tateossian, Moorer jackets, and Barrett shoes.
Furthermore, the chain is the exclusive distributor of Atelier Portofino in Russia, a company specialising in individually tailored men's suits, and owns the mono-brand boutiques, Barrett and Jacob Cohen.
