Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a chain of cinemas that are only for domestic films.
‘I would create a chain of cinemas that are exclusively for Russian films, and the tickets would cost 2-3 times less than for foreign-produced films’, he said.
Mr Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete with major Hollywood films for viewership.
More than 100 films are made in our country each year, but, on average, only 20-25 films make it to the screen.
‘And it's even very difficult for them to compete with “Transformers” and “Iron Man”, the promotion of which are pumped up with huge budgets’, the film director said.
It bears reminding that, on 1 July, the Tavrida All-Russian Educational Youth Forum started working in Crimea.
The participants include teachers of creative professions and young professionals from various creative fields and disciplines of the humanities from all over Russia and countries of the near and far abroad.
