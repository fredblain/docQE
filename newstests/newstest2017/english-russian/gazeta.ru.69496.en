An evening in memory of Ernst Neizvestny will be held in Moscow.
An evening in memory of the sculptor, Ernst Neizvestny, will be held in Moscow, TASS reports.
The event will take place on 15 August, at the Central House of Writers.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to Neizvestny, face-to-face, in the United States.
As such, it was decided to organise this evening for those who would like to remember him in his native landâ€™, stated the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
They noted that this is important to the sculptor's widow, Anna Graham, and to his friends throughout the world.
Close friends of Neizvestny have been invited to the evening event, including: the poet, Yevgeny Yevtushenko; the artist, Boris Messerer; President of the Pushkin Museum, Irina Antonova; the director, Mark Rozovsky; as well as Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinsky; Head of the Department of Culture for Moscow, Alexander Kibovsky; and Deputy Mayor of Moscow, Leonid Pechatnikov.
Earlier, it was reported that Ernst Neizestny's relatives plan to hold a memorial service for the sculptor in New York, presumably before 14 August.
