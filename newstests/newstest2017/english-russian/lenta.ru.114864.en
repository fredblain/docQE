A pensioner turns a stepladder into a ‘budget-friendly beach diving platform’.
Online users laughed at photos of an older man setting up a stepladder on the beach and turning it into a diving board.
The picture was posted on several entertainment portals, as well as in the ‘My Taganrog’ group on the VKontakte social network, which is why many decided that the photograph was taken on the shore of the Azov sea.
In the comments, the ‘innovation’ was dubbed a ‘budget-friendly diving platform’ and a ‘mobile diving board’.
Many praised the man for his creativity and ‘resourcefulness’, while others drew attention to the fact that the man runs a serious risk of injury by jumping from his platform, given that he placed it at an insufficient depth.
However, one of the commentators on the Pikabu portal noted that it's impossible to judge the depth of the sea from the picture.
‘First of all, we don't know how deep it is there: the beach could be scattered with sharp drop-offs just a metre in front of the ladder; and, secondly, even if it's only one metre deep there, with the right skills, it's possible to jump from a couple of metres’, wrote a user using the nickname, C0JIbAMDJZ
That being said, the Italian publication, ‘Roma Today’, writes that the man with the ladder was spotted on a beach near Rome.
