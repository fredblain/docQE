Kommersant-Boscosport correspondent, ALEXANDER ZILBERT, lived the life of an Olympic athlete in the Olympic Village, inspected Team Russia House, had lunch at the on-site cafeteria, and, after all of this, even passed a WADA test.
It seems that life here never stops for a second.
Even at night.
The last events sometimes end after midnight, after which the athletes still need about one and a half to two hours to return to the Olympic Village.
Furthermore, people are constantly checking-in and checking-out of the village, as some athletes leave Brazil after finishing their competitions, while others, on the contrary, have only just arrived here.
Well, it's only 7:30 a.m. and all of the heads of the Olympic delegations are crammed into one of the temporary tents.
We usually discuss certain mundane operational issues at these meetings, recounts Igor Kazikov, Head of the Sports Delegation of the Russian Olympic Team. In spite of the fact that the building where our people have been housed is considered to be a showpiece – it was one of the first to be commissioned and was shown to all the inspectors – even here, certain deficiencies are constantly being found.
One day there's a problem with the hot water, and the next day it's, excuse me, the toilets.
We struggled with issues of cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one was even showing up to clean.
Then, the cleaners started to show up, but only to spray some kind of substance on the floor, and that was all.
Their floors, can't you see, are somehow innovative.
Supposedly you can't wash them like a normal person.
Sure, we know these kinds of floors: ordinary laminate flooring!
In sum, we successfully managed to switch cleaning companies and now everything seems to be OK with this.
The Olympic Village is like Yuzhnoe Butovo, a residential district fenced in by mountains on one side and on the other sides, there is an impressive ditch filled here and there with water.
Well, for security, there is also a two-metre iron fence around the whole perimeter, along which guards, armed with automatic weapons, stroll.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3,604 apartments, located inside 31 buildings.
A massive Russian flag hangs on one of these 18-storey buildings: this building has been totally handed-over for use by our team.
Taking a glance at the small foyer by the entrance, you can immediately identify the problems that are apparently the most pressing for our home team.
Two notices are hanging at the front desk: a printed one, ‘Please, do not throw paper in the toilet!’, and a hand-written one, ‘I will accept pins as gifts’.
The front desk itself is buried under pamphlets.
Their cheerful colours contrast with the titles of the brochures: ‘A guide to infectious diseases for travellers to Rio de Janeiro’; ‘First aid for drowning, choking on a foreign object, loss of consciousness - the steps of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation’; and ‘First aid for burns, heat stroke, fractures, and bleeding’.
The inside text is, generally speaking, reassuring.
For example, this one: ‘the infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent recovery.
However, not everyone can expect a favourable outcome.
Of course, Team Russia has a medical centre at its disposal, which is always ready to provide residents of the house with professional assistance, including relaxation and sports massage.
Across from the medical centre is our delegation's headquarters.
Next to the door, there is an inspirational poster: ‘In spite of everything, we shall prevail!’.
And, of course, there is poetry:
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
They are only believed by those who are afraid.
The fewer of us there are, the sweeter the taste of victory: Russia will not back down and will not be broken!
And to further raise one's spirits, there hangs an announcement: ‘Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of his Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alexeev will perform spiritual care for the athletes of the Russian Olympic Team.
Prayer service and other religious rites can be ordered by phone...
In fact, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Ceremonies for representatives of all faiths within the village.
While Russians, it turns out, are given special treatment: they have their own chapel.
In light of congestion on the elevator between the ninth and the fourth floors, I decided to go down the stairs that are recommended for use during a fire.
And, in the darkness, I stumbled over bodies laying down on them.
By all accounts, it was the staff from the new cleaning company sleeping.
On the ready, I dare say, at any moment to rush to wash the innovative floors, they had decided to arrange a naptime for themselves directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I had a meeting with a long-time acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach for our trampolinists, who led them to Olympic gold, 16 years ago already, in Sydney.
He and his pupil, European champion, Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
By and large, there is nothing to complain about, the honoured coach of Russia shares his impressions. We live two to a room, the beds, of course, are almost right up against each other, but it's not critical.
There is one bathroom for four people, but at least it's spacious.
Of course, the wardrobe is laughable; it's made of cloth and doesn't inspire a lot of confidence, but things can be put in it.
‘No, well, can you imagine it? They've run out of tea!’, tennis player, Svetlana Kuznetsova, who met me in the main dining room, says while throwing her hands up in dismay.
It's called the main dining room if for no other reason than the fact that it provides 2,7 thousand square meters of space and is ready to accommodate 5 thousand visitors at one time.
Here, they produce 60 thousand servings a day absolutely free of charge.
The menu options include: ‘The Best of Brazil’, ‘Global Cuisine’, ‘Asian Dishes’, and ‘Pizza and Pasta’.
The last option, as I noticed, is very popular with our volleyball players.
Having said that, I couldn't find soup, for example, in any one of the areas of the giant restaurant.
Who cares about soup?, Kuznetsova says in astonishment, There's no tea!
It's a good thing I brought some Chinese tea to brew with me.
And a teapot.
But, in general, just so you understand, the food at the tennis courts is even worse.
Here, there is at least something to choose, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose the steamed cod and meatballs in tomato sauce.
A sign is situated beside each dish with its name in three languages – English, French, and Portuguese – and it also shows the nutritional value of the item and the presence of allergens.
And well, I must confess, it was entirely edible.
I don't even understand why there is always such a queue at the local McDonald's.
The well-fed, relaxed, and, in a manner of speaking, ‘food drunk’ athletes are awaited at the restaurant exit by our best friends: representatives from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They cleverly entice with a quiz, the winner of which will receive a tee-shirt.
They're luring them in, you could say!
To get a gift, you have to correctly answer at least eight out of ten questions.
A girl from WADA ambushed me with ‘There are questions in Russian!’.
But she didn't ambush the right person.
That is to say, I harnessed my patriotic impulse, of course.
The situation already took a turn for the worse by the second question: ‘If I received a notification to report to doping control, should I report immediately to the doping control centre?’
I settled on option B: ‘No, I have one hour’.
I was caught, how to say, off guard.
I forgot that there's no sense in waiting for a break from WADA.
Essentially, you need to report immediately.
Well, by the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation had become entirely critical.
For some reason, I thought that if I was having a hard time sticking to a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and, by the way, it is hard for me!), I could use dietary supplements to get ‘extra nutrients to enhance my performance’.
But alas, they won't allow it!
To be more precise, the answer is formulated in such a way that they don't outright forbid it, but rather, in a few sentences, strongly advise against it.
That WADA doesn't play fair!
‘So, how's it going, Russia?’, the presenter of the quiz mockingly questions.
There was nowhere to hide: behind me were Efimova, Isinbayeva, and the rest of our depleted team.
So I buckled down and, using my last ounce of strength, won that pitiful tee-shirt.
As the saying goes, let them see what we're made of!
In a triumphant mood, I wandered into the nearby fitness centre.
I got caught up with counting the fitness machines.
I lost track at 250.
I noted with surprise that there was not a single Russian athlete to be found among this mass of treadmills.
But maybe that's the way it should be?
Let those who don't know how to play be the ones who train!
However, one of our boys was sitting at the medical clinic located nearby.
In line to see the optometrist.
Don't worry; he's not a shooter.
At the clinic, and for that matter, as with everywhere else you look throughout the village, hangs a device for distributing condoms.
It is inscribed with an inspiring appeal: ‘Celebrate with a condom!’
Then, you just have to turn a piece of metal resembling the knob of a door lock, and a condom, made of natural latex from the Amazon, readily falls from the device.
I took one for myself, as a memento.
The athletes won't miss it; they brought in 450 thousand of these for them.
In fact, the Olympic Village has a whole recreation centre for celebratory and leisurely pursuits.
Beside it, for good measure, there is an informative plaque, reminding that the International Olympic Committee, in various ways, is spending $3.25 million on the athletes per day.
The centre is inundated with video games, billiards, ping-pong tables, foosball and air hockey tables, and some odd equipment that looks like video training simulators.
‘What is that?’, I ask a comrade in a Ukrainian team uniform, who is actively using the strange toy.
Of course, he could have just said that he didn't want to talk to someone in a Team Russia uniform, and that would have been that.
Here, incidentally, by some sort of strange set of circumstances, my eyes are sore from all these boys in yellow and blue.
A team that never stops playing around, it turns out.
It takes no less than three hours to walk around the whole village, exploring every nook and cranny.
But, if you walk and don't get a ride in the electric cars, you will discover Team Canada House with a moose at the entrance and a pavilion with a restorative bath, and a ticket office, and a laundromat, and a dry cleaners, and a hair salon, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods, and a post office with unique stamps (only you won't be able to wait out the queue of Chinese stamp collectors anyways), and a bank, and a lost and found, and a photo booth.
And in the late evening you, exhausted, will sit down beside an olive tree, decorated with multicoloured ribbons in memory of the athletes' dearly departed friends and relatives.
And you, to the accompaniment of a device randomly spraying a liquid to kill insects, will think about eternity.
That is to say, about the Olympic movement.
Which, in this village, doesn't stop even for a minute.
