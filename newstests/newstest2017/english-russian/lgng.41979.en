Astronomers have discovered a mysterious space object beyond Neptune.
The celestial body is very dim and its diameter is about 200 kilometres, the publication, ‘New Scientist’, writes.
According to researchers, the object is moving in an orbit that is completely uncharacteristic of the Solar System.
It is situated almost perpendicular in respect to the other planets.
The mysterious discovery was dubbed, Niku, which, if translated from Chinese, means ‘rebel’ or ‘unconquered’.
