141 victims of the terrorist attack at Domodedovo received payments from the airport.
141 people received charitable payments from the Aviatsionny Foundation, which was created by management at Domodedovo airport to help victims of the terrorist attack in 2011, Interfax reports.
According to the airport's press secretary, Alexander Vlasov, two other claims are currently under consideration.
‘The foundation is continuing to make charitable payments to victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and is providing comprehensive assistance to resolve ongoing issues’, added Vlasov, while recalling that a website for the foundation, which contains complete information on the process of rendering charitable assistance, was specifically created to facilitate interaction with the victims.
In 2011, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device in the international arrivals area at Domodedovo.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 37 people were killed and another 172 were injured.
