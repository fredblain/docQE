Poland suggests that it will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish Oil and Gas Company, PGNIG, has not ruled out the possibility that, in a few years, the supply of gas from Russia could become unappealing to it, as a result of a reorientation towards fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was announced by Bohuslav Marzec, Vice President of Finance for the Polish company.
TASS quotes him as saying this.
‘It may just happen that we will no longer buy any gas (from Gazprom); we are currently diversifying our supply.
Within the next four years, the main directions of supply for us will be from the East, raw materials from LNG terminals, and Norway’, said Marzec.
Currently, Gazprom occupies the dominant position in gas shipments to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that, in the first half of 2016, the Russian supplier delivered nearly 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas to it, which is 30% higher than in 2015.
The Russian gas giant's share in PGNIG procurements grew to 49.8%, compared to 40% a year earlier.
Recall that, on 22 July, Poland's antimonopoly agency denied the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
That being said, a month earlier, Poland made a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic metres of gas through Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by Alexander Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Board for the holding.
An auction for the allocation of Nord Stream 2 capacities will be held in 2017, and it is planned that an auction for its installation will take place in the autumn of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom does not plan, as of yet, to take any actions in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to withdraw from long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, stated Alexander Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Board for the company.
He recalled that, in the first quarter of this year, the Poles just increased their procurements of gas from the Russian Federation by 42%.
The deputy chairman of Gazprom added that the mere fact that Poland's PGNIG filed a complaint with the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not necessarily mean that negotiations have broken down.
Previously, the Polish company appealed to the court in order to reduce the purchase price for Russian gas.
It bears reminding that the representative of the Polish government for issues of gas and energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, said that Polish authorities have decided not to extend the gas supply contract with Gazprom.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the representative of the Polish government for issues of gas and energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, stated that, in six years time, his country could opt out of deliveries of the ‘blue fuel’ from the East.
According to him, Warsaw is planning to build the Baltic Pipe, a new LNG supply terminal, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 calls for the construction of two lines of off-shore pipelines running from Russia to Germany under the Baltic sea, with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year.
