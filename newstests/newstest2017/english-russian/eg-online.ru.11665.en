Moscow's Gazstroibank has lost its license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations from the credit institution, Joint Stock Commercial Bank GAZSTROIBANK, which is registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK, pursued a high-risk lending policy related to the investment of funds in low-quality assets.
A reasonable estimate of assumed risks, as requested by the regulatory authority, and a reliable picture of the value of the bank's assets, led to the emergence of grounds for the application of bankruptcy prevention measures at the credit institution.
Furthermore, the credit institution was involved in dubious transit transactions.
A temporary administration has been appointed at the bank for a period of validity up until the appointment of the bankruptcy manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit institution have been suspended in accordance with federal laws.
JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK is a member of the deposit insurance system.
It bears reminding that, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ ‘On the insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation’, insurance payouts to bank depositors, including sole traders, covers 100% of the remaining balance, but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total per depositor.
Payouts, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will commence no later than on 26 August 2016.
According to accounting statements, as of 1 August 2016, JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK held 335th place in the banking system of the Russian Federation in terms of assets.
