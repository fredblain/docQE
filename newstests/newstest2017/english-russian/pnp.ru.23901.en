The matter of the second indexation of pensions in 2016, could be decided in the next two to three weeks.
This was announced on 12 August, by Deputy Prime Minister, Olga Golodets, during a visit to Bryansk Region.
We have put in place specific parameters as to how much pensions should be increased in order to cancel-out the inflation that exists in the country.
All the calculations have been made.
Right now, economists are taking stock of the past six months and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeksâ€™, Interfax quotes Golodets as saying.
Commenting on the plan to increase the retirement age by six months each year, proposed by the head of the Centre for Strategic Research, Alexei Kudrin, the deputy prime minister announced that the cabinet is not considering this subject.
At the end of July, news broke that the government had agreed on a policy to fully index pension benefits in 2017.
