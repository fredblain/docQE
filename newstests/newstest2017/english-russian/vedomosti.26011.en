Two agencies are conducting an investigation into the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea, Kommersant writes.
The FSB is collecting evidence linking the detained individuals to the organisation of subversive activities in Crimea.
As previously reported, a confession was made by Evgeny Panov, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armyansk, the oil depot in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields as potential targets for sabotage.
Law enforcement officials believe that far from all of the saboteurs' accomplices have been apprehended.
This, in particular, served as grounds for arrest of the suspects at the Kiev District Court in Simferopol, the publication notes.
