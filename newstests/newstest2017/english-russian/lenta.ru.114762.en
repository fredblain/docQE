A fisherman caught a rare blue lobster off the coast of the Cape Cod peninsula (USA).
The man found the crustacean amongst others caught in his underwater trap, ABC News reports.
The American plans to hand it over to the local aquarium.
The lobster weighs around a kilogramme.
It should be noted that Wayne Nickerson has been catching lobsters for the past 35 years.
According to his spouse, the first time in his career that the man caught a blue lobster was in 1990.
According to ABC News, the crustacean acquires a dark blue or light blue colour as a result of genetic variations.
In April 2016, news broke that fishermen had caught a rare specimen of a deep-water shark, a Megachasma pelagios (a megamouth shark), off the coast of Japan.
The five-meter-long animal weighs around a tonne.
