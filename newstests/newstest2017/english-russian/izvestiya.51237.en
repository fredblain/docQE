The head of the Executive Office of the President has been replaced
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed Sergei Ivanov's former deputy, Anton Vaino, as head of his administration.
Vladimir Putin carried out the reshuffling of the Executive Office of the President and expressed hope that the new head of his administration would facilitate the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino said at the meeting that he considers the anti-corruption measures, which Ivanov launched as head of the Presidential Executive Office, to be important, and he promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation surrounding Sergei Ivanov's resignation from the post of head of the administration to be transparent and understandable, and that the reshuffle will not fundamentally change anything in the work of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the outgoing head had been working in the presidential administration for a significant period of time and had effectively organised the work of the Presidential Executive Office.
Aton Vaino, Deputy Head of the Presidential Executive Office, a person who perfectly understands the specifics of this job, has taken his place.
