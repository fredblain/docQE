This year, residents of Crimea will receive a notice to pay transport taxes.
Now, residents of the peninsula will pay taxes on land, property, and transport.
The head of the Federal Tax Service for the Republic of Crimea, Roman Nazdrachev, spoke about this at a press conference.
By the end of 2016, Crimean automobile owners will receive a notice to pay transport tax.
So far, the tax agency has counted around 250,000 people owning vehicles.
The State Traffic Safety Inspectorate and the Federal Registration Service will provide information on taxpayers.
‘If, as of the first of January, we receive data on owners of real estate and land, then the citizens of Crimea will be responsible for paying these taxes next year’, stated Roman Nazdrachev.
Citizens entitled to benefits will be granted discounts on the payment of property taxes; first and foremost this concerns the category of pensioners.
Also, there is a system of deductions on land tax, depending on the entitlement category of the taxpayer, but according to the head of the Federal Tax Service, it's too early to talk about this before 2017.
