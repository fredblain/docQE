The development of terms has begun in Sukhoi Log.
Kommersant has learned that the government has been asked to approve a proposal for the terms of an auction for the gold deposit, Sukhoi Log, while preserving two key restrictions.
It is proposed to bar from the auction companies that are 25% or more foreign-owned and those bidders whose capital will not consist of at least 25% state participation.
Industry insiders aren't expecting the government to rewrite the terms, noting that there are already many players that won't risk taking on the complex and expensive project.
They could announce the auction in August and hold it in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has submitted to the government a draft of the regulation and auction terms for the world's largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia, Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, with 130 million ounces in reserves and resources), said two of Kommersant's sources who are familiar with the situation.
The draft was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them elaborated.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment confirmed to Kommersant that the draft was submitted to the government.
The representative in charge of subsoil use, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin, told Kommersant that the official's administrative office has not yet received the draft.
‘The auction could be announced as early as August, immediately after a government order is issued, and given the timeframe for the submission of applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender could take place as early as October’, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment said.
According to Kommersant, two key requirements for potential participants were preserved in the wording of the version of the draft that was submitted for approval to the ministries and the Federal Executive Authority in July (Kommersant has a copy).
The first is that bidders must have a minimum of 25% state participation in their capital.
The second is that companies under the control of foreign investors are denied access to the auction, based on an understanding of Federal Law No.57 on investments in strategic entities.
According to the two articles of the federal law mentioned in the draft, which Kommersant already wrote about on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (a 25% share and higher) are not tax residents of Russia or who have dual citizenship need not be permitted access to the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, given that Sukhoi Log is classified as a federal-status mineral resource (reserves of over 50 tonnes of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment confirmed that the draft 'contains restrictions on the participation of foreign companies’, but declined to comment on the details in advance of the government order.
The requirement of state participation in the capital of auction participants was proposed by Irkutsk Region, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment told Kommersant in December 2015, which was later confirmed by the region's governor, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it had been sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment by his predecessor, Sergei Eroschenko, ‘who had an agreement on investment projects with Rostec’.
Kommersant's sources did not specify who lobbied for the restriction on the participation of foreigners.
‘But this is in the spirit of the times: to not hand over control of the largest gold deposits in Russia amidst Western sanctions’, argues a Kommersant source familiar with the auction’s preparations.
On 1 August, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, Sergei Donskoy, said that foreigners ‘can enter into a consortium’, if bidders invite them to participate ‘in the capacity of a financial structure and as technology partners’.
Kommersant's sources consider it highly unlikely the government will adjust the terms.
The industry front-runner for Sukhoi Log is believed to be a consortium of the largest gold mining company in the Russian Federation, PJSC Polyus (which is controlled by Suleiman Kerimov's son, Said), and Rostec.
As Kommersant wrote, in July, the partners established a joint venture, CL Gold, which gives Polyus 51% of the shares, and the structure, Rostec RT-Global Resources, 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, while Polyus told Kommersant that ‘definitely, they are interested in the asset’ and possess all the necessary expertise and resources for its development.
‘But a final decision on the feasibility and form of our participation will be made after the announcement of terms’, Polyus added.
ALROSA might participate in the auction, but the decision is up to the government of the Russian Federation, said Kommersant's sources.
Russia's GV Gold and Canada's Kinross Gold, which is developing assets in Chukotka Region, have also announced the possibility of participating in the development of Sukhoi Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.
Sergei Kashuba, Chairman of the Russian Union of Gold Producers, told Kommersant in December 2015, that investments in Sukhoi Log were valued at between $2.5 and 4 billion.
The majority of potential bidders are deterred not only by the investment amount, but also by the complexity of the project: extensive in-mine exploration of reserves and methods for working with complex ores are required, Kommersant's sources in the industry explain.
