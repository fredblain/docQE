A new charge will be brought against RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov
Lawyers for the RBC journalist, Alexander Sokolov, accused of organising an extremist organisation, reported that the prosecutor's office found mistakes in the case against their client.
We only learned that the prosecutor's office had made such a recommendation from investigators yesterday.
We were scheduled to participate in a court hearing regarding restrictions on familiarisation with the materials of the criminal case, but the hearing never actually took place, and then the investigators informed us of the recommendation issued by the prosecutor's office’, RBC quotes lawyer, Olga Dinze, as saying.
She related that the prosecutor's office pointed out to the investigators the discrepancy between the classification of the case and the materials collected.
Now, investigators will have to bridge the gaps in the body of evidence and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either the case will fall under a different section of the Criminal Code (CC), or it will stay the same, but with different arguments and new evidence, Ms Dinze clarifies.
As Kommersant reported, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded the RBC journalist from a charge worded as ‘undermining the stability of political environment’ and ‘overthrowing the government by illegal means’.
