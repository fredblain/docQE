Sandwiched between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, after attaining independence from South Africa in 1990, this country, with a population of 2.4 million people, has achieved tremendous success, especially over the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the government pays a lot of attention to education.
While people in developed countries take for granted free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries, secondary and even elementary schools require tuition fees.
Furthermore, governments are often advised to introduce fees for education for the purpose of ‘cost recovery’.
In Namibia, however, education in primary schools is free.
Moreover, starting in 2015, secondary education also became free.
The country's leaders are also actively working on other important areas.
Efforts to eliminate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97% over the past ten years.
In contrast to the international trend of growing inequality, in Namibia, it is shrinking.
Compared to the figure for 1993, the Gini coefficient, which is the standard measure of inequality in income distribution, fell by 15 points.
Back then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
While the poverty rate has fallen from 69% in 1993, to less than 30%.
The number of people living in conditions of abject poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also fallen from almost 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest rating for freedom of speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is significantly ahead of the United States and other wealthy countries.
Additionally, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Corruption Perceptions Index, which is compiled by human rights activists from Transparency International.
Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia manages to maintain high growth rates.
Meanwhile, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than a 1/3 of the level of debt in the United States and in the majority of European countries.
Of course, Namibia still has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional assessment methods, still remains quite high at almost 28%.
Also, as with other countries in the region, there is a high incidence of HIV/AIDS in Namibia: almost 17% of the population are infected.
According to the World Bank, Namibia belongs to the group of upper middle-income countries, but the authorities insist that their state is actually a developing country.
Namibia, of course, faces some difficulties that are typical of underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very big and arid country with a small population.
Isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers, which somehow need to be integrated into modern society without losing their identity, live throughout the country in deserts.
The integration of people who, a quarter of a century ago, were on the periphery of the world economy, is a difficult task for any country.
It is even more difficult for Namibia: like every other country in the world, it is being faced with the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia never thought of giving up; the country is dealing with the problems it faces.
Almost immediately after attaining independence, the authorities got to work on creating a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions came together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides inexpensive medical services not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20% of visitors to medical facilities in the northern areas of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia talks about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbours.
Namibians understand that you can't choose your neighbours, and, as such, decided not to pick a fight with them, but to cooperate instead: to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional health projects, to promote investments and the exchange of students.
In addition to this, the Namibian government rightly decided that rich natural resources can just as easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that the profits from Namibia's natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They also realise that it would be irresponsible not to try and maximise profits from the sale of the country's resources, and are revising investment laws and production contracts to make sure that this is being done.
Transparency is critical to this process, and that is why the government's strong support for freedom of speech is so important.
As the head of state, Hage Geingob, noted, the media often says things he doesn't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia needs to protect the freedoms it has gained, the President says.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are non-renewable.
Some of them, such as the fishing industry, are renewable, and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia demonstrates that even those countries that begin with serious flaws – racism, colonial systems, inequality, and a low level of development – can embark on a path to shared prosperity.
Its achievements deserve international recognition and emulation.
