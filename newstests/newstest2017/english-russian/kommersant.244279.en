Four people were killed as a result of a series of explosions at resorts in Thailand.
All at once, several explosions rocked southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed and 19 were injured as a result of the attack.
The epicentre of the explosions occurred in the town of Hua Hin.
Ten foreigners, citizens from four states, were among the victims; there were no Russian citizens among them.
None of the terrorist groups have taken responsibility for the incident yet, but the Ministry of the Interior was quick to declare that the Islamists had not been involved in it.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organising the explosions.
According to preliminary information from the local police, the scale and distinctive features of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military running the country.
The attacks happened in popular tourist areas such as Patong Beach in Phuket, and in the cities of Hua Hin, Trang, and Surat Thani.
After the military junta took over control of the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (in 2012) to 2.8% (in 2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors that was showing growth.
14 million people have already visited the country in 2016, 1.5 million more than the figure for 2015.
The first individuals suspected of preparing and organising the attacks have already been detained, reported Police Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen.
It's too early to talk about motives, he added, but the Ministry of the Interior is 'confident that they are not connected to international extremist groups'.
It's too early to draw conclusions, said Mr Patanacharoen.
However, we do know that these incidents are not directly linked to any form of terrorism; in fact, they are acts of local sabotage, and we are trying to establish the identity of those who were behind them.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Sirikit.
The Thai junta considers protecting the monarchy one of its main priorities, so the incident was most likely directed against it.
According to statements by Police General Sithichai Srisopacharoenrath, the bombs were remotely detonated within a half hour of each other.
They were hidden within the trees on busy streets, which were filled with tourists having lunch in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four killed was a young Thai woman selling street food.
The identities of the remaining victims are still unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, they include four citizens of Germany, three Dutch nationals, two citizens of Italy, and one citizen of Austria.
There were no Russian citizens among the victims of the explosions, the press service of the Russian Federal Tourism Agency reported.
Local experts have also connected the explosions with the referendum that took place on 7 August, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported the new draft constitution.
It was prepared by the constitution drafting committee appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide if they support a system in which the upper house of the parliament is entirely appointed by the military and has a significant role in electing the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and it will be tested for the first time during the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall that, on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the commander of the country's army, Prayuth Chan-ocha.
According to him, the army was prompted to take this step by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed a curfew and censorship, dispersed protesters, and dismissed the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok ended up in a state of emergency
In January 2014, the government of Thailand, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, announced the imposition of a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces surrounding the capital.
The special security arrangement lasted for 60 days.
How two explosions rocked Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the heart of Bangkok, two explosions occurred at the Victory Monument, which was one of the main sites of the protest, and as a consequence, 28 people were injured and five of them were in critical condition.
The explosions were carried out by unidentified individuals on motorcycles.
The authorities increased security measures in the capital and brought in military forces to protect demonstrators.
