Pope Francis shared a meal with refugees from Syria at the Vatican.
Head of the Holy See Press Office, Greg Burke, said this on Thursday, 11 August, CTV News reports.
The migrants arrived from the Greek island of Lesbos at the invitation of the Pontiff.
The lunch was held at the Vatican's Saint Martha's House, where Francis' private quarters are located.
It is noted that the meal was attended by two groups of Syrian refugees whom the Pontiff visited in Greece on 16 April.
At that time, he took 12 migrants, including six children, aboard his airplane on his return flight to the Vatican.
The second group of Syrians arrived in June.
The Holy See has taken on responsibility for their care.
‘The Pope brought toys and gifts for the children, and they gave him their drawings in return; today, both the children and adults were able to talk with the Pontiff about the first days of his life in Italy’, Burke reported.
During his April visit, the Pope called the migration crisis that erupted in Europe, in 2015, ‘the biggest disaster since the Second World War’.
Greece is one of the countries through which the majority of migrants find their way into Europe.
According to Greek authorities, in 2015, a total of 800 thousand people crossed over from Turkey to the island belonging to Greece in the Aegean Sea.
As a result, Lesbos has become the key transit point for refugees on their way into the EU.
