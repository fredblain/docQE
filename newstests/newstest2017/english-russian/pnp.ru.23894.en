Presnensky Court is keeping defendants in the case of a mass brawl at Khovanskoye Cemetery in detention until 14 November, having granted a corresponding request from investigators.
There are 14 defendants in this case.
Recall that, on 14 May, there was a mass brawl at Khovanskoye Cemetery between hundreds of immigrants from Central Asia and the North Caucasus, which involved the use of weapons and resulted in the deaths of three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yury Chabuev, and a lawyer and co-founder of the public organisation, Healthy Nation, Alexander Bocharnikov, have been charged with organising murder.
