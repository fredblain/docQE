The FAS has fined Google almost half a billion roubles
The reason was a violation of competition in the mobile applications market.
The antitrust proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company argued that Google grants manufacturers of smartphones access to Android components on terms that prohibited the pre-installation of applications from other developers, and, in particular, Yandex.
The FAS has confirmed these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position in the market and forced manufacturers of mobile devices to install other apps alongside the Google Play store.
Following the results of the inquiry, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to penalise Google, said Alexey Dotsenko, Deputy Head of the FAS.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the ruling entering into force.
The FAS concluded that all companies, including multinationals, must comply with the law on the protection of competition.
By the same token, Google intends to first examine the ruling and then determine the next steps to be taken: abide by it or challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service declared the company to be in violation of the competition law back in September of last year and ordered them to adjust their contracts by 18 December.
However, Google refused to agree to this.
Since then, the company and the agency have been involved in litigation.
The FAS has noted that, in spite of the fine, they are discussing the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement with Google.
The current course of action is leading nowhere.
This is the view expressed to Echo of Moscow by Eldar Murtazin, a leading analyst with Mobile Research Group.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would have no impact on either users or on the competitiveness of the corporation.
