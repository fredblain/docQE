The Muslim Religious Board (MRB) of Tatarstan renounces the use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, a plenum of the MRB ordered their imams to lead Friday sermons in Tatar only, to force young Tatars ‘to learn their native language’.
The administrative body states that this ‘in no way infringes’ on the rights of Muslims of other ethnicities.
Several of the mosques in Kazan have complained that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60% of worshippers, such as foreign students, migrants, and even Tatars themselves.
The imams fear that their sermons in Tatar ‘won't reach the entire audience’.
Yesterday, a plenum of the MRB of Tatarstan unanimously adopted a decision to hold Friday sermons in the Republic's mosques in the Tatar language only.
As stated by the Mufti of Tatarstan, Kamil Samigullin, this should become an incentive to young Tatars ‘to learn their native language’.
‘For those who will say that it is “difficult”, we intend to organise absolutely free Tatar language lessons at each of the large mosques’, Mr Samigullin promised.
He added that ‘the decision has already come into force’, and, today, sermons in all mosques ‘should already be in the Tatar language’.
He reminded that the MRB of Tatarstan publishes the journal, ‘Shura’, with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
An imam, who does not speak Tatar well enough, ‘can use them to thoroughly prepare’.
The MRB of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand congregations throughout all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to the mufti, in the regions, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
On the other hand, a number of mosques in Kazan previously had been predominantly using the Russian language.
In particular, as indicated by the mufti, this was the practice at Burnaevskaya Mosque, Zakabannaya Mosque, and at ‘Eniler’.
However, Mr Mukhametshin emphasised that the leadership has made it an objective that all students are proficient in both official languages of the Republic, regardless of ethnicity.
‘This has absolutely nothing to do with infringing on the rights of non-Tatar Muslims’, emphasised Mr Mukhametshin, explaining that the sermon itself ‘is not a mandatory main part of namaz’.
In fact, the namaz itself will still be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons at mosques will still be available in the Russian language.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told Kommersant that there was never a serious threat of the Tatar language vanishing from mosques.
Except for Russian and Tatar, no other languages, according to him, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are used in sermons in the Republic.
The decision by the MRB was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT).
Chairman of the Executive Committee of the WCT, Rinat Zakirov, told Kommersant: ‘the mosque is an important part of our national life’.
It would be a shame if the Tatar language were to disappear from this sphere.
He noted that conducting sermons in the Tatar language only, ‘is the will of the imams themselves’, but that the Executive Committee of the WCT ‘considers this to be the right decision’.
The imams interviewed by Kommersant who were conducting sermons in Russian, are ready to follow the decision by MRB, however, they believe that the congregation will have difficulty understanding the clerics.
Both Tatars and Russians attend mosque.
Many don't understand the language.
Of course, it's going to be a bit difficult for them.
‘We're going to have to change our ways’, says the Imam of Burnaevskaya Mosque, Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, even many Tatars have a closer affinity to sermons in the Russian language, since ‘Russian is what is in schools and in child care facilities, on the radio, and everywhere, from the very beginning’.
However, he is under the impression that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in the Russian language, which are held on other days.
We have faith in Allah.
Allah will show us the way out of this situation’, he concluded.
But we have around 60% that don't know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
‘That is why we switched to the Russian language four years ago’, the imam says.
He believes that sermons in the Tatar language will ‘reach a more limited group and will not reach the whole audience’.
But we will abide by the decision of the plenum.
Simply, the results of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
‘For example, it will only be easier for me, because Tatar is my native language’, concluded Gabdulla Galiullin.
