Crimean Bridge construction workers have acquired the anthem, ‘I am driving a pile’.
A video called, ‘I am driving a pile’, has appeared on the YouTube channel of the Crimean Bridge project.
This is a song for the builder of this structure: the central figure says that the bridge will help to ensure that they ‘won't lose touch with this massive country’.
The writer, in particular, sings about how he is ‘driving a pile’.
The music is accompanied by a video from the Crimean Bridge construction site.
The song was written and performed by Konstantin Khomenko, a designer from Institute Giprostroymost-Saint Petersburg, which developed the construction project.
He is not a professional musician.
