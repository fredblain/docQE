<seg id="2">A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."</seg>
<seg id="4">The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."</seg>
<seg id="11">"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.</seg>
<seg id="12">Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was a kind spirit with a big heart.</seg>
<seg id="14">His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was the brother that went with the flow.</seg>
<seg id="17">"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">An international team of biologists have come to the conclusion that the longest-living vertebrate is the Greenland shark, which can live for approximately 500 years, RT reports.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists conducted radiocarbon analysis of the eye lenses of 28 Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="4">The largest shark, with a length exceeding five metres, could be between 272 and 512 years old.</seg>
<seg id="5">The biologists believe that a slow metabolism, which results in slower development, plays an important role in the shark's longevity.</seg>
<seg id="6">Female Greenland sharks only reach sexual maturity by the age of 150.</seg>
<seg id="7">Previously, it was thought that the longest living of all the vertebrates was the shark's ‘neighbour’: the Greenland whale.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is it worth going to a health resort if you don't have any health problems?</seg>
<seg id="2">Our expert: Head doctor of a health resort, Olga Bogush.</seg>
<seg id="3">If a person is healthy, but just burnt-out from work, should they bother going to a health resort?</seg>
<seg id="4">A health resort vacation is essential to us not only in terms of treatment, but also for the prevention of illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the setting of a health resort, a person can check the state of their body and receive recommendations from a doctor about how to live so that their health does not fall apart.</seg>
<seg id="6">These types of recommendations are useful to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="7">‘I'm just burnt-out from work’, is an important signal from the body that shouldn't be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Constant stress and mental and physical exhaustion can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="9">But about 90% of visitors feel stressed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Moreover, the people who are most susceptible to it are from large cities and between the ages of 45 and 55.</seg>
<seg id="11">So, it's best to not compound matters and give yourself time to relax before it’s too late.</seg>
<seg id="12">Studies show that 98% of people lower their biological age during a stay at a health resort.</seg>
<seg id="13">Modern health resorts offer a comfortable stay for the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, if you want to spend your vacation with the children, you won't have to part ways with them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wellness programmes are available for children, even the very youngest, which include not only diagnostic services, consultations with a paediatrician, and tests, but also therapeutic services.</seg>
<seg id="16">For example: swimming (there are children's pools at many health resorts), inhalation therapy, specialised dietary regimes, massage, oxygen cocktails, and physiotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="17">A doctor determines a course of treatment taking into account patient-specific indications and the particular characteristics of the growing body.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, health resorts usually offer a children's club with activity coordinators, where children can explore play activities and various workshops.</seg>
<seg id="19">Some health resorts even open their doors to guests with infants, providing babies with the necessary conditions and offering the services of an experienced nanny.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mild winters, long summers, and an abundance of sunny days each year (more than 300) create the perfect conditions for year-round recreation at the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.</seg>
<seg id="21">After all, the body needs rest not only during the summertime.</seg>
<seg id="22">So, there's no need to fear the weather outside, especially since the majority of procedures are conducted indoors and are in no way dependant on the season.</seg>
<seg id="23">In general, it is advisable to undergo treatment at a health resort 2 times a year, especially for people of a mature age.</seg>
<seg id="24">The main draw of the Caucasian Mineral Waters region is, of course, its healing mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Yessentuki, and Narzan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their waters possess unique properties and act on different systems of the body.</seg>
<seg id="26">The water differs in terms of temperature, the amount of salt, total mineralisation, and chemical and gas composition.</seg>
<seg id="27">A doctor chooses the water depending on the patient’s wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, Narzan has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and repairs the function of the gastrointestinal tract and the metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="29">Yessentuki-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract and reduces blood sugar levels.</seg>
<seg id="30">New Yessentuki offers anti-inflammatory, choleretic, and diuretic effects.</seg>
<seg id="31">The water at Slavyanovsky has the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="32">When prescribing water treatment, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.</seg>
<seg id="33">If there are signs of hypertension, they choose water with a lower salt content, because the salts retain liquid, which leads to increased blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="34">The consumption of mineral water requires adherence to a regime: the water should be drunk at a particular time, in a required amount, and at a specific temperature.</seg>
<seg id="35">Nowadays, various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are also available at health resorts.</seg>
<seg id="36">What kinds of health treatments, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, are available at resorts in the region?</seg>
<seg id="37">Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is the Tambukan salt lake, the silt mud from which is beneficial for the joints, spine, and internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="38">It offers anti-inflammatory, resolving, and immunomodulatory effects.</seg>
<seg id="39">Then there are constitutional walks along individually tailored routes.</seg>
<seg id="40">They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is the huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).</seg>
<seg id="41">They are popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in close proximity to the Narzan mineral spring.</seg>
<seg id="42">There, you can also take baths in wine, pearls, iodine-bromine, selenium, and sage-liquorice, depending on what the doctor prescribes for you.</seg>

<seg id="1">Extending the fruiting period.</seg>
<seg id="2">What can be done to make the harvest last until the end of the season?</seg>
<seg id="3">Yuliya Belopukhova, an agronomist and dacha dweller, explains.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's time to give those tall tomato plants a trim: remove the new shoots, cut off the top of the plant, and remove all the leaves up to the second-to-last cluster with fruit and blossoms with small young fruit – they won't have time to ripen.</seg>
<seg id="5">We top-dress all tomatoes, regardless of their ‘type’, as well as peppers and eggplant, with an ash-superphosphate extract and treat them with biologicals (Dozrevatel, to speed up the ripening and growth of the fruit; Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Baktofit, to ward off diseases; Immunotsitofit, to strengthen immunity; and Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocide, Fitoverm, if there are pests).</seg>
<seg id="6">At the end of summer, the only chemical products that should be used are copper sulphate, colloidal sulphur, and insecticidal soap.</seg>
<seg id="7">We do the final watering of the plants.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the greenhouse, we lower the long climbing cucumbers from the trellis so that the lower bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) is laying on the ground, then we water it with a warm water and Zircon solution, and cover the stem in 5-7 cm of compost.</seg>
<seg id="9">Extending the fruiting period of squash is also easy: cut off the old leaves, water it with warm water and a multinutrient fertiliser solution, and add some nutrient-rich soil under the bush.</seg>
<seg id="10">To protect against night-time cold, drape material over the garden bed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Keep the plants uncovered during the day, but cover them after sunset.</seg>

<seg id="1">Signs of the end.</seg>
<seg id="2">What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?</seg>
<seg id="3">Economists have seen signs that Russia is emerging from the longest recession of the past twenty years.</seg>
<seg id="4">As noted by the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, Russia's GDP is showing improvement: in the second quarter, GDP declined by 0.8% in annual terms.</seg>
<seg id="5">This figure represents the smallest decline since the beginning of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the latest data from Rosstat, Russia's economic contraction slowed to 0.6% in the second quarter.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade also recently spoke about the stabilising situation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Slow growth ahead.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to experts from the Central Bank of Russia, the Russian economic recession is a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="10">‘The index rating of Russia's GDP indicates that the recession is behind us, and that slow economic growth is ahead’, says a bulletin from the Bank of Russia called ‘What the trends indicate’.</seg>
<seg id="11">Experts from the regulatory authority increased the GDP estimate model for the current quarter to 0.4%, while the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.</seg>
<seg id="12">A spokesperson for the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade reported that Russia's GDP stopped contracting in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted decline in GDP amounted to 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.</seg>
<seg id="14">But over the course of the quarter, the decline stopped: it amounted to 0.2% in April, while in May and June, the change in GDP was within the range of 0-0.15%’, RIA Novosti quotes the spokesperson from the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade as saying.</seg>
<seg id="15">The slowdown in the rate of contraction of the Russian economy over the past five quarters suggests that the ‘bottom has already been passed’.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bloomberg names the growth in demand for electricity and rail transport, as well as the revival of business among other markers that point to signs of recovery in the national economy.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you take into account the fact that it's a leap year, it is clear that the trend of a 1% increase in the consumption of electricity can be partially attributed to the additional workday.</seg>
<seg id="18">Then, we'll factor in the colder than average annual temperatures in the first quarter.</seg>
<seg id="19">The next argument is the increase in freight traffic, but here it's difficult to obtain accurate data, and an increase or decrease of 0.5% in semi-annual volume could also be explained by seasonal factors’, explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, there are other more obvious signs of stabilisation of the Russian economy.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, a decline in price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="22">In July, the consumer price index amounted to 7.2%, compared to 15.6% for the same month last year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, Rosstat has recorded deflation over the past two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.</seg>
<seg id="25">If you look at the dynamic of the rouble exchange rate, despite displaying high volatility at the beginning of the year, it strengthened by 12% between the beginning of the year and August.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is also one of the signs of recovery, which indicators in the real economy should follow’, underscores Yakovenko.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition to this, since April, there has been growth in the volume of industrial output in the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="28">In June, this figure rose by 1.7%.</seg>
<seg id="29">The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover has slowed from -32.8% in January 2016, to -20.7% in May.</seg>
<seg id="30">A positive trend is also evident in the labour market, where the rate of unemployment fell to 5.4%.</seg>
<seg id="31">The only time it has been lower was in September 2015 (5.2%).</seg>
<seg id="32">In spite of the favourable situation in the labour market, the issue of real disposable incomes leaves a lot to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="33">In annual terms, this figure has declined by 4.8%.</seg>
<seg id="34">This factor could slow down the economic recovery, given that household spending represents a sizeable contribution to GDP.</seg>
<seg id="35">As a rule, its share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50%.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition to weak consumption, the Bank of Russia's strict policy could also be mentioned in terms of other risk factors for economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="37">The regulatory authority has held rates at 10.5%, which doesn't have the best impact on the real sector.</seg>
<seg id="38">Inadequate levels of investment are also a negative factor, as this hinders development of industrial capacity.</seg>
<seg id="39">Overall, however, we can assume that by the end of the year, the rate of decline in the Russian economy will slow to -0.5%, compared to -3.7% in 2015’, says Irina Rogova, an analyst with Forex Club.</seg>

<seg id="1">The process of naturalisation of athletes, which has recently taken-off in Russian football and was well established in the winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, is still not as extensively developed in summer sports.</seg>
<seg id="2">If former foreigners are also competing for Russia at the Olympic Games in Rio, then in the majority of cases, we are talking about natives of countries that were former republics of the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process: a sufficiently large number of Russians are competing under the flags of other states.</seg>
<seg id="4">In each case, the story behind the change of nationality is different.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some were brought to a different country by their parents during childhood, leaving no choice.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some couldn't successfully compete for a spot on the Russian team.</seg>
<seg id="7">While some thought that there would be better conditions to improve in their sport abroad.</seg>
<seg id="8">AiF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the German passport of the 27-year-old girl, it is written that her name is Lisa Ryzih.</seg>
<seg id="10">Previously, however, it was, of course, Elizaveta.</seg>
<seg id="11">She was born in 1988, in the city of Omsk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to immigrate to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="13">The young girl didn't have a choice.</seg>
<seg id="14">There, she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister and pursue track and field.</seg>
<seg id="15">Just like her sister, Lisa chose pole vaulting.</seg>
<seg id="16">If she had stayed in Russia, it is doubtful she could have ‘usurped the thrown’ of Yelena Isinbayeva.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio, Lisa will be the only one of our countrywomen, even if only a former one, in the pole vault event.</seg>
<seg id="18">Her highest achievements in this sport are bronze at the 2010 European Championships and silver at the continental competition in 2016, which she won, once again, amidst Yelena Isinbayeva's absence.</seg>
<seg id="19">29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.</seg>
<seg id="20">Her parents are religious proselytisers of an evangelical branch.</seg>
<seg id="21">For the most part, they left for the United States, because of their religion, when the young girl was just three years old.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.</seg>
<seg id="23">They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lena already started to get involved in wrestling in school.</seg>
<seg id="25">Producing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where she continued to practice at the US Training Centre for Wrestling, under the guidance of another former Russian citizen, Vladislav Izboinikov.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her very first fight.</seg>
<seg id="27">But then, at the World Championships that same year, she had a victory.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prior to this, in fact, she managed to win silver at the World Championships in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="29">After this, there was a bronze in 2013 and a silver in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="30">26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first became acquainted with synchronised swimming.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, it wouldn't be right to say that our coaches in Russia trained her.</seg>
<seg id="32">Soon afterwards, the girl's family decided to immigrate to the United States and settle down in the city of Colorado.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maria continued her training there.</seg>
<seg id="34">Soon thereafter, she joined the US team and made an excellent showing at the Pan American Games.</seg>
<seg id="35">Of course, she couldn't compete at the intensive international level of Russian synchronised swimming, but for America, her results were at the very top.</seg>
<seg id="36">Kristen Shaldybin, which sounds odd in Russian, received her new name at 11 years of age, when her parents decided to continue the girl's training in rhythmic gymnastics overseas.</seg>
<seg id="37">Up to that point, the girl was engaged in her favourite sport in her native Yaroslavl.</seg>
<seg id="38">Having immigrated to the United States, she quickly joined that country's youth team, and later also pushed her way into the main national team.</seg>
<seg id="39">At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of course, she wasn't in contention for first place on the world stage, but she staged a real breakthrough for the United States, taking the team of stars and stripes into the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="41">Another one of our former ‘rhythmic gymnasts’ is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who competes for Team Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">Jana was born in Tolyatti.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2008, when the girl was only 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany: there, the girl had a better chance of making it onto the national team.</seg>
<seg id="44">It didn't take long before she was representing her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.</seg>
<seg id="45">There, however, Jana was only able to take 17th place, which was not enough to get into the final competition in the individual event.</seg>
<seg id="46">On the other hand, in the two years prior to this, she, in fact, managed to win a bronze medal at the Youth Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="47">There is another gymnast, but this time, an artistic gymnast: Irina Sazonova.</seg>
<seg id="48">If the immigration route of the already-mentioned gymnasts could be called conventional, then the choice of Irina's family was very unusual: Iceland.</seg>
<seg id="49">Ira is an alumna of a Volgograd sport school.</seg>
<seg id="50">Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became national champion.</seg>
<seg id="51">Truth be told, Ira still trains in Russia: she comes home specifically so that she doesn't lose her skills.</seg>
<seg id="52">In Rio, she didn't perform as well as she would have liked.</seg>
<seg id="53">Her best placing was 40th in the individual all-around.</seg>
<seg id="54">There is extremely little information about the swimmer, Maria Ugolkova, in the Russian infosphere.</seg>
<seg id="55">Maria has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="56">However, for quite a long time, she was competing under the Russian flag and producing some decent results: there was even a national record in the 200 metre butterfly.</seg>
<seg id="57">In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and started competing under the red and white flag.</seg>
<seg id="58">In Rio, her best performance was 14th place in the 4x100 m freestyle relay.</seg>
<seg id="59">In order to get to the Games, the girl started a crowdfunding project, through which she managed to collect around 6,000 francs, which enabled her to pay for her preparations for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="60">31-year-old freestyle wrestler, Adam Batirov, spent virtually his entire career under the Russian flag.</seg>
<seg id="61">During that time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, Russian champion, and an international class Master of Sports of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="62">When he stopped making it onto our national team, the time had come to start thinking about changing nationality.</seg>
<seg id="63">For several years, the talented fighter disappeared from the sporting podium.</seg>
<seg id="64">His triumphant comeback happened at the 2016 Asian Championships: Batirov was already representing Bahrain, for whom he won a gold medal and got a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="65">Back home, there is even less known about another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, than about Swiss swimmer, Maria Ugolkova.</seg>
<seg id="66">The fact of the matter is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.</seg>
<seg id="67">It is there that Mikhail started to get involved in artistic gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="68">He didn't achieve great success at the international level.</seg>
<seg id="69">In Rio, his best performance was 40th place in the qualification round on the parallel bars.</seg>
<seg id="70">But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympics in artistic gymnastics is already a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="71">When Nastya, who was born in Moscow in 1985, was just 9 years old, her family immigrated to Israel.</seg>
<seg id="72">There, the girl continued to train in synchronised swimming, performing very well at the national level.</seg>
<seg id="73">In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronised swimming.</seg>
<seg id="74">In a duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eighth place.</seg>
<seg id="75">She was fifth in the solo programme.</seg>
<seg id="76">Just like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kroyter competes for Team Israel.</seg>
<seg id="77">When the boy was just 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry had already become national champion.</seg>
<seg id="79">In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.</seg>
<seg id="80">A year later, Kroyter also won gold at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="81">In addition to high jump, Dmitry also does long jump and triple jump.</seg>
<seg id="82">31-year-old Albert is another native of Khasavyurt, who, after a long time of competing for Russia, decided to switch his sport nationality.</seg>
<seg id="83">However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, whom he will also represent in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="84">In Russia, he competed for the School of Higher Sports Mastery in Krasnoyarsk, and, in 2011, even became national champion.</seg>
<seg id="85">28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow into the family of a member of the USSR's volleyball team, Yaroslav Antonov.</seg>
<seg id="86">Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognised as the best volleyball player on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="87">Soon thereafter, he decided to continue his career in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="88">There, the family remained as permanent residents.</seg>
<seg id="89">In 2015, as a part of the national team, he became the bronze medal winner at the European Championships, which were held in his new homeland.</seg>
<seg id="90">Khadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994, and got stuck with his family in the midst of the war.</seg>
<seg id="91">After ten years, his parents decided to emigrate.</seg>
<seg id="92">The original goal was Norway, but it wasn't possible to get into this northern country, and they had to go to France, to Nice.</seg>
<seg id="93">There, Zelimkhan continued to study freestyle wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="94">Soon thereafter, he won the Junior World Championship, and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="95">In Rio, he will be the only representative for France in the wrestling tournament.</seg>
<seg id="96">And once again it's freestyle wrestling, and once again it's a former Russian citizen.</seg>
<seg id="97">But this time, the story is about a native of North Ossetia who immigrated to Spain: it's about Taimuraz Friev.</seg>
<seg id="98">At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and, currently, he competes for this country's national team.</seg>
<seg id="99">Before this, of course, the 30-year-old athlete also managed to produce very good results in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="100">He became the bronze medal winner at the National Championships in 2007 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="101">Tired of not making it onto the team, Taimuraz decided to change sports nationality.</seg>
<seg id="102">The last on our list is a Chechen boxer, Arthur Biyarslanov, born in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="103">When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.</seg>
<seg id="104">There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, started to box.</seg>
<seg id="105">Since then, Arthur has become Canadian Champion three times over, and, in 2012, he became the World Youth Champion.</seg>
<seg id="106">In 2015, Biyarslanov won gold at the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.</seg>

<seg id="3">Previously, Sergei Ivanov held this post.</seg>
<seg id="4">‘The head of state appointed Anton Vaino as Chief of Staff of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation by decree, relieving him of his current post’, reads a decree signed by Putin and published on the Kremlin website.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since May 2012, Vaino has been Deputy Chief of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Eduardovich Vaino was born on 17 February 1972, in Tallinn.</seg>

<seg id="9">In 1996, he graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Faculty of International Relations.</seg>
<seg id="10">From 1996 to 2001, he worked in the Russian Embassy in Japan and then in the Second Asian Department at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="11">From 2002 to 2004, he held various posts in the Russian Presidential Protocol Directorate.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why should the children of Cossacks have classes at schools?</seg>
<seg id="2">According to Governor V. Kondratyev, 'Cossacks need to be educated not with campaigns and parades, but in a systematic manner'.</seg>
<seg id="3">They should grow up and, at the very least, from the age of 7, understand that they are Cossacks and their education should be Cossack.</seg>
<seg id="4">But so far this work, it seems to me, is being carried out as a mere formality, and, I suspect, primarily just on paper.</seg>
<seg id="5">If Cossack classes incorporate everything positive that has been previously accumulated and take it to a whole new level, then I will be pleased.</seg>

<seg id="1">Housing and communal services continue to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.</seg>
<seg id="2">There is evidence of misappropriation of funds that are earmarked for public utilities from budgets at various levels.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the Prosecutor General's Office, artificially high prices are one of the most common crimes in the sphere of housing and communal services.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a result, consumers in the region overpaid power suppliers by more than 170 million roubles.</seg>
<seg id="5">The other day, the Prosecutor's Office for Krasnodar Krai also became aware of the fact that unjustified costs were included in the prices.</seg>
<seg id="6">While the expenses of OOO IV-Consulting (supplies cold water) show that 4 million roubles were spent hiring cars at above-market prices.</seg>
<seg id="7">And there are a host of examples like this throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">The people are handing over their last rouble to ‘public utilities’ and, what's more, they are paying in a timely manner: according the Ministry of Construction, Housing, and Utilities of the Russian Federation, the average collection rate is 94% of the population.</seg>
<seg id="9">He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code at once: embezzlement, money laundering, abuse of power, and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to investigators, as head of a fund that was involved in the repair of city facilities, Makarov entered into contracts with business owners who did not actually perform work, but were still paid.</seg>
<seg id="11">The businessmen simply returned a large portion of the money to him.</seg>
<seg id="12">While, as the owner of a property management company, Makarov collected money from the population, but didn't pay service providers and used the money for his own purposes.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result, damages to the budget and residents are in the millions of roubles.</seg>
<seg id="14">Makarov's fraudulent scheme is sadly typical of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="15">A whole wave of arrests and detentions of directors of property management companies, who embezzled citizens' money, has swept across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kokhan continues; incidentally, he is also a former city council member and is accused of fraud amounting to 91.7 million roubles.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to investigators, between 2012 and 2013, he established 6 property management companies and created 3 limited liability companies in Elizovo in Kamchatka Krai.</seg>
<seg id="18">One of them carried out contractual work for a property management company, while the other two played the role of payment processing centres, that is, they took money from the population.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, A. Kokhan never transferred the funds to the power suppliers, but spent it on his precious self.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's fairly difficult to litigate in the housing and communal services sector.</seg>
<seg id="21">Cases aren't opened or drag on.</seg>
<seg id="22">And very complicated housing legislation ‘helps’ with this, figures Svetlana Razvorotneva, Executive Director of the non-profit partnership, Housing Control.</seg>
<seg id="23">We don't have time to start working on one law, before we devise a new one that is necessary to get the previous one to work.</seg>
<seg id="24">There are also too few experts, including judges, in the area of housing and communal services.</seg>
<seg id="25">Lawyers themselves acknowledge that housing law is given very little attention at universities.</seg>
<seg id="26">Refusals to initiate criminal proceedings and red tape during investigations are even reported in the Prosecutor General's Office.</seg>
<seg id="27">Of the 3,500 pending criminal cases in 2015, less than half made it to trial.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the rest of the cases, the investigations took on a protracted nature, and every fifth case was suspended in connection with failure to identify the accused party.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is not uncommon that mistakes made by law enforcement officials are written off by them on gaps in the current legislation.</seg>
<seg id="30">The law exists, but inquiry bodies are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of forgery, but only 60 criminal cases were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the first 5 months of this year, their number has only slightly increased to 99.</seg>
<seg id="33">But what is meant by the falsification of tenants meeting minutes?</seg>
<seg id="34">It means: a change in the management of the building, and financial and other issues that circumvent the opinion of the owners.</seg>
<seg id="35">But it also means that ordinary companies, that want to work honestly and don't ‘milk’ the population, can't break into the housing and communal services market.</seg>
<seg id="36">It turns out that tenants are losing out, and so are small and medium businesses.</seg>
<seg id="37">Primarily, due to the eradication of corruption, in and of itself, throughout the state, assures Anton Zharkov, a member of the Duma Committee on property issues.</seg>
<seg id="38">And currently, this work is actively underway.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's not just isolated actions: it's a deliberate policy of fighting corruption.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of course, not all regions are in such a sad state.</seg>
<seg id="41">In particular, there are no signs of scandal in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="42">Why are there no such scandals in the housing and communal services sector in Moscow, as there are in many other regions?</seg>
<seg id="43">Well, because the city government has shown an iron will and has established order, Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the Duma Committee for security and combating corruption, told AiF.</seg>
<seg id="44">I am referring to personnel issues, legislative amendments, and legal education.</seg>
<seg id="45">Close supervision of property management companies has been instituted and they have all gone through the licensing process.</seg>
<seg id="46">Citizens' complaints are dealt with promptly and in full public view (and the appeals of residents and responsive measures are posted on the internet portal of the Government of Moscow).</seg>
<seg id="47">Many people not only pay their monthly bills, but also keep a close eye on what is written on them, and how the building is being maintained.</seg>
<seg id="48">The public's awareness about the rights of owners and the responsibilities of resource-supplying and property management organisations is very high.</seg>
<seg id="49">Plus, Moscow checks the reasonableness of rates for housing and communal services, because a sizeable portion of budgetary funds goes towards subsidies and benefits for a multitude of population categories.</seg>
<seg id="50">Probably, all of this is what explains the calm situation in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="51">So, it turns out that everything depends on the will of regional authorities?</seg>
<seg id="52">Perhaps the weak-willed should change jobs?</seg>

<seg id="1">The Turkish gambit.</seg>
<seg id="2">Can Erdogan forgo a friendship with the EU and the United States?</seg>
<seg id="3">The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has given an ultimatum to the United States, demanding a choice be made between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organising the coup.</seg>
<seg id="4">He announced this while speaking to his supporters in Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="5">Erdoğan urged the Americans to withdraw support for the Fethullah Terrorist Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States is urged to change its position.</seg>
<seg id="7">Experts believe that the rift in Turkey's relations with the West is continuing to grow and could lead to another attempt to change power in the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">‘Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO (Fethullah Terrorist Organisation).</seg>
<seg id="9">Either FETO, which organised the coup, or democratic Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">They must make this choice’, the Anatolian Agency quotes Erdoğan as saying in an appeal made on Wednesday evening in Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="11">The President of Turkey once again, but this time more sternly, urged the United States to comply with his demand, which he first voiced immediately after quelling the rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="12">To recall, on the night of 16 July, in Turkey, an attempt was made by high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army to overthrow the country's legitimate government, and an attempt on the life of the head of state was also made.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, after Recep Erdoğan made an appeal to the people, the rebellion was quelled, and its organisers and participants were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="14">In total, about 8 thousand people fell under suspicion, including, in addition to military personnel, the likes of teachers and scientists.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to Recep Erdoğan, Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States, acted as their mentor.</seg>
<seg id="16">Erdoğan's supporters have also suggested that the Americans might also have been directly involved in the coup.</seg>
<seg id="17">The United States has denied all the accusations made against it, refuses to extradite Gülen, and has advised a change in tone.</seg>
<seg id="18">The most recent statement on this matter from representatives of the State Department were made at the time of Erdoğan's visit to Saint Petersburg this past Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, this is not stopping the President of Turkey, who is stubbornly sticking to his guns and is also making demands on his other Western partners.</seg>
<seg id="20">‘Ankara will stop fulfilling its obligations under the migration agreement with the EU if Brussels does not set a date for the cancellation of visa restrictions on Turkish citizens’, Turkey’s Minister for EU Affairs, Ömer Çelik, stated on 9 August.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to him, the introduction of amendments to the anti-terrorism law by Ankara, as required by the EU, would put the internal security of Europe at risk.</seg>
<seg id="22">Note that, on 1 August, Sigmar Gabriel, Vice Chancellor of Germany, demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with threats to open the borders to migrants, in order to achieve a simplification of the visa regime with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="23">His words were in response to a corresponding statement from Turkey’s Foreign Minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.</seg>
<seg id="24">Çavuşoğlu made another provocative statement this past Wednesday, suggesting that Turkey may withdraw from NATO.</seg>
<seg id="25">The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not rule out that the country would consider the possibility of leaving the alliance if they didn't receive the expected support from it.</seg>
<seg id="26">The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence sector is not a step against NATO.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the area of defence, that import missiles’, Çavuşoğlu stated in an interview with Anadolu Agency.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to him, Turkey, from now on, needs to create its own defence system based on its own technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="29">‘Up until now, Turkey had been trying to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have been disappointing, and we have started to look for other partners’, the minister said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Experts believe that all of this speaks to the serious differences between Turkey and the West, and the country's reorientation towards the East.</seg>
<seg id="31">Director of the International Institute for Political Expertise, Evgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdoğan is playing his game right now and can't afford a serious confrontation with the West.</seg>
<seg id="32">He is very much tied to the West both in terms of business and in terms of the military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdoğan will try to find a balance, while preserving the framework of relations with the West.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although, of course, it would be more convenient for the Americans to have a completely obedient person in this post’, the expert explained to AiF.</seg>
<seg id="34">According to him, it can't be ruled out that, following the Turkish leader's statements (about the non-payment of compensation to the EU, demands for a visa-free space with Europe, and the extradition of Gülen from the United States), he will come under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="35">‘Recep Erdoğan will be faced with a deterioration of relations with America and the European Union, and, in particular, they will apply pressure on him in terms of humanitarian issues, dictatorial methods of governance, and so on’, Minchenko believes.</seg>
<seg id="36">Director of the Centre for Political Information, Alexey Mukhin, concedes that the President of Turkey will change his point of view on relations with Russia as soon as it's in his interests to do so.</seg>
<seg id="37">Eight months ago, Erdoğan took a very tough stance against Russia and sought favour in the West by any means.</seg>
<seg id="38">For a very short time, the situation has been reversed.</seg>
<seg id="39">There are no guarantees that, after some time, the President of Turkey won't change his priorities once again.</seg>
<seg id="40">I think that Erdoğan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.</seg>
<seg id="41">Having found himself between the two poles of the West and Russia, he will try to seek maximum benefit for himself’, Mukhin believes.</seg>
<seg id="42">In his opinion, right now, the main task of the President of Turkey is to hold onto political power in the country, and this is precisely why he needs Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States stops supporting Gülen.</seg>
<seg id="43">Both the EU and United States need Turkey, with whose help they are controlling the situation in Syria and the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="44">Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached’, the expert believes.</seg>
<seg id="45">A different point of view is espoused by Anna Glazova, Head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="46">Currently, Turkey's relations with both the EU and the United States are quite tense, and this is connected, first and foremost, with the domestic policies being pursued by Erdoğan himself.</seg>
<seg id="47">I think that this crisis in relations will worsen and, against the backdrop of this crisis, Turkey's leaders will try to carry out a reset of policy in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="48">It's no accident that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, claim they are willing to change their stance on a whole range of issues related to Syria, differences with Israel have been settled, and active political engagement with Iran is currently underway’, Glazova explained to AiF, suggesting that Erdoğan's next step will be the normalisation of relations with Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to her, the policy currently being carried out by Erdoğan is a return to the foreign policy concept that was being pursued by Turkey before the start of the Arab revolutions.</seg>
<seg id="50">‘It was then, from a position of "zero problems with neighbours" that Turkey began to actively develop its relations in the Middle East and Asia’.</seg>
<seg id="51">The President of Turkey just finished very successful visits to Russia and African countries.</seg>
<seg id="52">Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will continue to evolve and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's position both in the regional and international arena’, the expert believes.</seg>
<seg id="53">Glazova believes that it would be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to the previous relationship with EU; the question right now is whether or not the EU will start to get tough in response to Turkey, which could resort to opening the borders to migrants and, as such, create serious problems for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.</seg>
<seg id="12">He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.</seg>
<seg id="13">Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.</seg>
<seg id="8">I lost count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russian public opinion has also turned since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He's denied that emphatically.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could claim a victory of sorts.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is also an economic motive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has slumped by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.</seg>
<seg id="33">They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.</seg>
<seg id="38">Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="40">Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.</seg>
<seg id="42">Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.</seg>
<seg id="45">Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="3">Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.</seg>
<seg id="6">During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.</seg>
<seg id="9">Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins</seg>
<seg id="3">Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I'm very emotional because my family are here as well</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm relieved and very humble.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.</seg>
<seg id="18">I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.</seg>
<seg id="20">He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has been a rollercoaster ride.</seg>
<seg id="24">Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.</seg>
<seg id="5">A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).</seg>
<seg id="10">On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiles convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a move that has mystified Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">No-one knows yet.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="30">But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.</seg>

<seg id="4">Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Thursday before his termination was announced.</seg>

<seg id="6">I regret that it occurred," he said in a statement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife</seg>
<seg id="2">The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.</seg>
<seg id="10">We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.</seg>
<seg id="14">On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Happily, it all went very well.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go a worthy hunt for health and happiness</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world turns.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been the lament of many for the the past decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is getting people off the couch and into some activity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response, which overloaded servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">So how does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In a nutshell, players on smartphones go out looking for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'captured'.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze, jumping off the couch for the search.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching, the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health campaigns to get people to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active everyday" have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the beauty of Pokémon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people are even making new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes somebody might walk into a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">So what?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could previously track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course.</seg>
<seg id="30">However because of Pokmeon's success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all of it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on vault.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jaw-dropping on floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant all over.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now, finally, an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.</seg>
<seg id="21">While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.</seg>
<seg id="22">A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.</seg>
<seg id="26">Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.</seg>
<seg id="27">Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.</seg>
<seg id="28">She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.</seg>
<seg id="32">She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:</seg>

<seg id="5">Police say the triple killing doesn't appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take purses or $2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's occurring within a residential area in front of a home," Howard said to CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="9">The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told police that it wasn't unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half-hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="2">Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.</seg>
<seg id="3">But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mom Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know about while pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="4">When he first came home my initial thought was, I can't do this.</seg>
<seg id="5">I can't do this.</seg>
<seg id="6">I didn't sign up for this.</seg>
<seg id="7">Which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">She and her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund might never recognize them, and that he might not even survive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized.</seg>
<seg id="10">"My first response was 'I didn't think people did that anymore,'" Picciuto explained.</seg>
<seg id="11">Edmund walks with the help of a walker.</seg>
<seg id="12">Edmund didn't sit up or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he's slowly meeting some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="14">He's walking with help, and riding a bike.</seg>
<seg id="15">He also loves playing with his two brothers, and singing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for "please sing to me."</seg>
<seg id="17">"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it's not just typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic ones like Edmund's, and infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and Zika.</seg>
<seg id="20">Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.</seg>
<seg id="22">Picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future.</seg>
<seg id="23">I kept saying, what's going to happen?</seg>
<seg id="24">What's going to happen?</seg>
<seg id="25">And she still doesn't really know.</seg>
<seg id="26">I actually haven't asked for a prognosis in forever, because I don't expect anyone to really be able to tell me.</seg>
<seg id="27">But Picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from Zika.</seg>
<seg id="28">It gets better.</seg>
<seg id="29">You know it will get better for you.</seg>
<seg id="30">You will love your child, and your child will love you.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana lead the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected over the state through Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi were overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials, and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In south Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set record crests over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that flooding downstream in Ascension Parish is a threat, as those swollen rivers will be slow to drain into Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says waters from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose quickly overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We woke up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said.</seg>
<seg id="19">It came up to my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that it's the highest she's seen the creek in the 48 years she's lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltering Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann says flooding is "quickly becoming widespread" as heavy rains continue, saying officials are considering evacuation orders.</seg>
<seg id="24">Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="27">CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded.</seg>
<seg id="28">Residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding.</seg>
<seg id="29">Parish President Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water.</seg>
<seg id="30">Shelters have been opened in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond to house those who were evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"They will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Tangipahoa Parish city of Hammond, close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water, and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="33">"The last major flood we had was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.</seg>
<seg id="34">This one is on track to be a similar event.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">He said a handful of houses were reported as flooded Thursday, but none have been reported so far Friday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I've seen water in some places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming down."</seg>

<seg id="1">Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting</seg>
<seg id="2">Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.</seg>
<seg id="6">I just can't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="7">The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.</seg>
<seg id="8">Family tells the station he is expected to recover.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.</seg>
<seg id="14">The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.</seg>
<seg id="16">Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.</seg>
<seg id="17">It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.</seg>
<seg id="18">There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.</seg>
<seg id="19">So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.</seg>
<seg id="20">Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.</seg>
<seg id="21">No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="23">She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team looks, finally, like America.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is powerful.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.</seg>
<seg id="14">And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.</seg>
<seg id="19">Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."</seg>
<seg id="6">With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="1">The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat</seg>
<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.</seg>

<seg id="1">PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish</seg>
<seg id="2">Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are</seg>
<seg id="20">His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.</seg>
<seg id="27">Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.</seg>

<seg id="3">But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.</seg>
<seg id="4">So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid</seg>
<seg id="6">Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.</seg>
<seg id="7">U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.</seg>
<seg id="9">'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.</seg>
<seg id="10">'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.</seg>
<seg id="13">And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.</seg>
<seg id="14">Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor</seg>

<seg id="2">Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday</seg>
<seg id="3">Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.</seg>
<seg id="4">Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.</seg>
<seg id="5">MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thanks for that.</seg>
<seg id="8">Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.</seg>
<seg id="9">Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used</seg>
<seg id="10">Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????</seg>
<seg id="11">The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'</seg>
<seg id="12">Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'</seg>
<seg id="13">Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out</seg>
<seg id="14">Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being</seg>
<seg id="15">Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.</seg>
<seg id="16">You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.</seg>
<seg id="17">Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'</seg>
<seg id="18">It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'</seg>
<seg id="19">CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark</seg>
<seg id="20">Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf</seg>
<seg id="21">CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments</seg>
<seg id="22">The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.</seg>
<seg id="23">We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.</seg>
<seg id="24">We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.</seg>
<seg id="25">To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.</seg>
<seg id="26">That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.</seg>
<seg id="28">'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'</seg>
<seg id="29">'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'</seg>
<seg id="30">'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'</seg>

<seg id="2">Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.</seg>
<seg id="3">To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.</seg>
<seg id="4">She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf</seg>
<seg id="6">A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'</seg>
<seg id="7">She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'</seg>
<seg id="8">Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.</seg>
<seg id="9">'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'</seg>
<seg id="10">'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'</seg>
<seg id="11">She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.</seg>
<seg id="12">'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'</seg>
<seg id="16">'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'</seg>

<seg id="1">How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga</seg>
<seg id="2">It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.</seg>
<seg id="5">If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.</seg>
<seg id="6">You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds tricky?</seg>
<seg id="11">Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.</seg>
<seg id="12">But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue along Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his tongue along a Euro note, a Piccadilly Circus hand rail, a train toilet's flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself, and us, just what he was getting in to.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which has be made into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, threw up some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of licking a train's flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">All the way along his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system</seg>
<seg id="11">In the movie made about it he said: 'Ever since I was a kid I have been fairly carefree with my health and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil, eating worms and muddy water.'</seg>
<seg id="12">He certainly proved his reputation during the film.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he turned down was a filthy Russian public toilet.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">By comparison, freshly washed hands should come in under 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer count was over 4000 units, when freshly washed hands are less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have produced the traveller's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">He said in the film: 'That is close to one of the worst things I have smelled in a toilet.'</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in there.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in conjunction with Finnish dairy producer Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost people's gut bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valio's Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juice and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea "let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I asked him to, like the disgusting Russian toilet that's shown in the film.'</seg>
<seg id="31">Naturally some things were easier to get Ian to lick, some were pretty tough.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape.'</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction</seg>
<seg id="2">A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">This family are notorious and their name is notorious.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished</seg>
<seg id="14">Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="21">'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'</seg>
<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction</seg>
<seg id="33">Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tourists sun worshipping in Aveiro, Portugal, had the shock of their lives</seg>
<seg id="3">A Portuguese air force P-3C Orion plane swooped in incredibly low</seg>
<seg id="4">The air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incident happened in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by onto social media, said: 'It passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash.'</seg>
<seg id="10">Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me.'</seg>
<seg id="11">Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude</seg>
<seg id="12">The Portuguese Air Force said today the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted no-one's safety had been compromised.</seg>
<seg id="14">Wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of Madeira.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Portuguese air force said today the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions - thick fog and smoke from wildfires - which obscured his visibility</seg>

<seg id="1">The HACCP system has been mandatory for food services for more than a year already, but it still hasn't been implemented in the majority of cafes and restaurants in Saint Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="2">Inspections are becoming more prevalent and a business faces fines of up to 1 million roubles.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more than a year already, conformance with the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP, KhASSP in the Russian version) – an analysis of risks and critical control points – has been mandatory for manufacturers and transporters of food, as well as for companies in the field of food services in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU).</seg>
<seg id="4">In Saint Petersburg, inspections of businesses, by Rospotrebnadzor, for compliance with these standards started in February 2015.</seg>
<seg id="5">But so far, officials are only issuing fines for specific violations of the rules (see ‘The List of Documents’...).</seg>
<seg id="6">Failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost a company 600,000 roubles for the first violation and 1 million roubles for the second.</seg>
<seg id="7">HACCP was developed in the United States in the 1960s as a system that takes into account the risks of working with food and how to prevent them.</seg>
<seg id="8">At that time, the issue at stake was the safety of food for astronauts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Today, the system is used in all food enterprises, not only in United States, but also in Canada and in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">HACCP has been in force within the CU since February 2015.</seg>
<seg id="11">Businesses were given 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HACCP requirement first appeared in the technical regulations of the CU in 2011).</seg>
<seg id="12">However, both business owners themselves and officials acknowledge that the majority of companies have not even heard about this standard.</seg>
<seg id="13">Unfortunately, for a long time, we were convinced that the standard only applied to food production and not restaurateurs, explained Elena Tsereteli, Head of the Public Council.</seg>

<seg id="1">The expected timeframe for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is between the end of August and the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="2">But this won't lead to a spike in demand, since the core market, families with children, are already getting ready for school, experts point out.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Alliance of Travel Agencies sent a letter to the government yesterday with a request to now allow charters.</seg>
<seg id="4">‘For many Russian tourists, selecting affordable, quality seaside vacations is still an unresolved issue, because, in the resort towns of Krasnodar Krai and the Republic of Crimea, the majority of accommodation facilities are already booked up until the end of September’, note the authors of the letter, while emphasising that the establishment of charter operations in August would not significantly affect existing demand for Russian seaside tourism products.</seg>
<seg id="5">The North-West Division Office of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (RUTI) has reported that, if aviation authorities in Russia and Turkey are able to come to a decision quickly, then the resumption of charter flights to Turkey could be expected within a month.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is still no clear understanding of when charters will resume; it ultimately depends on the aviation authorities.</seg>
<seg id="7">Technically, planes could start flying in September, even in August, if tour operators quickly put together packages and reach an agreement with airline companies regarding the required flight paths’, says said Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects for the North-West Division Office of RUTI.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but it won't seriously affect the balance of power in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are getting ready for school or are spending their holidays in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the autumn season, tours are mainly purchased by individual travellers or couples.</seg>
<seg id="10">Charter packages can count on those who have the ability to spontaneously take a vacation’, says Pavel Rumyantsev.</seg>
<seg id="11">‘Turkey has a chance to attract lots of tourists if it provides very budget-friendly offers – 50-60 thousand roubles for a trip for two – because there are people who intentionally wait for very cheap tours’, says Valery Rosenthal, CEO of Optio-Travel travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Otherwise, there's no sense in counting on a buying frenzy; the majority of travel has already been planned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that, because there is demand for scheduled flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but there is no sense in expecting a buying frenzy.</seg>
<seg id="14">‘For Turkey, the launch of charters right now is a rehearsal for next season’, says Pavel Rumyantsev.</seg>
<seg id="15">‘The establishment of charters to Turkey is good news for the next season’, agrees Valeriya Rubtsova.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations from the credit institution, Joint Stock Commercial Bank GAZSTROIBANK, which is registered in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the regulator, JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK, pursued a high-risk lending policy related to the investment of funds in low-quality assets.</seg>
<seg id="4">A reasonable estimate of assumed risks, as requested by the regulatory authority, and a reliable picture of the value of the bank's assets, led to the emergence of grounds for the application of bankruptcy prevention measures at the credit institution.</seg>
<seg id="5">Furthermore, the credit institution was involved in dubious transit transactions.</seg>
<seg id="6">A temporary administration has been appointed at the bank for a period of validity up until the appointment of the bankruptcy manager or liquidator.</seg>
<seg id="7">The powers of the executive bodies of the credit institution have been suspended in accordance with federal laws.</seg>
<seg id="8">JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK is a member of the deposit insurance system.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, has reportedly died in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="3">Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">She was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.</seg>
<seg id="6">"One would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others, that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really," Akunjee said.</seg>
<seg id="7">In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a flight to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultana's family was told she married an ISIL fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months.</seg>

<seg id="2">Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.</seg>
<seg id="3">Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."</seg>

<seg id="8">Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vinyl destination: who is actually buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to litter the comments section with gnarly insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen, this statement derives from actual data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much talked-about record resurgence is driven not by a boom in millennials who want to embrace the novelty of a physical item, but by midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54, apparently.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists, either - it has emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% versus 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% versus 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are YouGov's results true?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a televised news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like: "So, let's take a look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look.</seg>
<seg id="11">While the heart of Soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain.</seg>
<seg id="12">I'd probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit, in which I stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Glaswegian Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I suppose I am," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls.</seg>
<seg id="18">His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally came out, and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint.</seg>
<seg id="19">"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a bit too young to get," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has, however, noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From conversations I've had, people have got rid of their collection, normally around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back," he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That may explain a boom in vinyl revivalists of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the familiar record sleeve, of items that recall halcyon teenage memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as some kind of comfort," Wez says.</seg>
<seg id="32">As a collector myself, I have that, and I think a lot of people do.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's an easy way to occupy your headspace.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We're like their social workers!" pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records.</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this stage of the news report, I would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">The "trophy" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three midde-aged men) has noticed.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Someone came in recently and said: "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,"" he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">That's not a large percentage, but it's definitely happening.</seg>
<seg id="41">More of the product side, less of the music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people saying: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">That's younger people, not older ones, late teens who are just getting into it.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which now dedicates almost an entire floor to vinyl, has a far more varied audience when I arrive.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">While the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synth- and sex-fuelled pop, rather than noodling jazz, is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records on sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She is window-shopping, rather than on a spending spree.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't earn a lot, she says, so collecting records isn't really an option.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music by a computer or another way, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants, I observe a group of teenage girls, who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily, before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">To the left is a stairwell, a wall of which is stacked with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary and classics, the essential records for any average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely decoration, some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "art vinyl."</seg>
<seg id="59">But, given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is little to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl.</seg>
<seg id="61">But while my findings suggest YouGov's results are accurate, in Soho record stores at least, they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record shops and on online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street, flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has been some journey for GB.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here, they lost just one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.</seg>
<seg id="22">Which is pretty much how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle</seg>
<seg id="2">There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, it was touch and go.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If they don't it goes everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It alters your outlook a bit.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.</seg>

<seg id="26">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very much in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.</seg>
<seg id="33">We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Poland suggests that it will not buy fuel from Gazprom.</seg>
<seg id="2">The state-owned Polish Oil and Gas Company, PGNIG, has not ruled out the possibility that, in a few years, the supply of gas from Russia could become unappealing to it, as a result of a reorientation towards fuel from Norway and other countries.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was announced by Bohuslav Marzec, Vice President of Finance for the Polish company.</seg>
<seg id="4">TASS quotes him as saying this.</seg>
<seg id="5">‘It may just happen that we will no longer buy any gas (from Gazprom); we are currently diversifying our supply.</seg>
<seg id="6">Within the next four years, the main directions of supply for us will be from the East, raw materials from LNG terminals, and Norway’, said Marzec.</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently, Gazprom occupies the dominant position in gas shipments to Poland.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that, in the first half of 2016, the Russian supplier delivered nearly 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas to it, which is 30% higher than in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Russian gas giant's share in PGNIG procurements grew to 49.8%, compared to 40% a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="10">Recall that, on 22 July, Poland's antimonopoly agency denied the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="11">That being said, a month earlier, Poland made a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic metres of gas through Nord Stream 2.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was stated by Alexander Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Board for the holding.</seg>
<seg id="13">An auction for the allocation of Nord Stream 2 capacities will be held in 2017, and it is planned that an auction for its installation will take place in the autumn of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom does not plan, as of yet, to take any actions in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to withdraw from long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, stated Alexander Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Board for the company.</seg>
<seg id="15">He recalled that, in the first quarter of this year, the Poles just increased their procurements of gas from the Russian Federation by 42%.</seg>
<seg id="16">The deputy chairman of Gazprom added that the mere fact that Poland's PGNIG filed a complaint with the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not necessarily mean that negotiations have broken down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Previously, the Polish company appealed to the court in order to reduce the purchase price for Russian gas.</seg>
<seg id="18">It bears reminding that the representative of the Polish government for issues of gas and energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, said that Polish authorities have decided not to extend the gas supply contract with Gazprom.</seg>
<seg id="19">Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.</seg>
<seg id="20">In March, the representative of the Polish government for issues of gas and energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, stated that, in six years time, his country could opt out of deliveries of the ‘blue fuel’ from the East.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to him, Warsaw is planning to build the Baltic Pipe, a new LNG supply terminal, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nord Stream 2 calls for the construction of two lines of off-shore pipelines running from Russia to Germany under the Baltic sea, with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year.</seg>

<seg id="1">The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2">A UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.</seg>
<seg id="3">All parties to the conflict deny using chlorine gas, however, UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, considers the fact of what happened to be indisputable.</seg>
<seg id="4">Similar allegations were made just before the third round of inter-Syrian talks that should begin in late August in Geneva.</seg>
<seg id="5">UN experts have opened an investigation into reports that chemical weapons were used in the Syrian city of Aleppo.</seg>
<seg id="6">The first information about a terrorist attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine gas, appeared on 2 August.</seg>
<seg id="7">At that time, the opposition said that aircraft dropped bombs with a poisonous substance in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day, but Moscow deemed these accusations to be utterly false.</seg>
<seg id="8">Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence blamed the opposition group, Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki, for the incident.</seg>
<seg id="9">Soon thereafter, it came to light that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was confirmed by one of the victims speaking to BBC.</seg>
<seg id="11">‘A few minutes later, I could smell the gas, my eyes started to burn, and it became difficult to breathe’, the publication quotes the witness as saying.</seg>
<seg id="12">At least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalised as a result of the attack.</seg>
<seg id="13">If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be regarded as a war crime.</seg>
<seg id="14">UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: ‘there is a lot of evidence that this actually did take place’.</seg>
<seg id="15">The prohibition of the use of chlorine gas for military purposes is spelled out in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).</seg>
<seg id="16">In spite of the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny using toxic gases, in 2015, human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the Syrian army using chlorine gas against the ‘moderate opposition’.</seg>
<seg id="17">The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that its districts are being bombarded on a daily basis, and the terrorists are preventing the withdrawal of residents from the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Reuters, the UN is waiting for Russia to establish a ‘humanitarian pause’ in military operations.</seg>
<seg id="19">The current regime of a daily, three-hour halt to hostilities, in the opinion of the organisation, is ‘insufficient to help the nearly 2 million civilians who are caught in the trap’.</seg>
<seg id="20">Staffan de Mistura's advisor for humanitarian affairs, Jan Egeland, stated that, in order to deliver aid into the city and evacuate the sick and wounded, a 48-hour cease-fire every week would be required.</seg>
<seg id="21">‘We have to send bulk cargo in convoys of trucks into an area where the roads are virtually destroyed and those that remain are mined’, reported Mr Egeland. But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table’.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Geneva, consultations between representatives of the United States and Russia, regarding the establishment of a ‘humanitarian pause’, continue.</seg>
<seg id="23">How Russia opened ‘humanitarian windows’ in Aleppo.</seg>
<seg id="24">On 11 August, amidst the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia announced the introduction of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will take place daily starting on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="25">The creation of ‘humanitarian windows’ is intended to enable the delivery of medicine, food, and basic necessities into the city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The decision by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation was made in the face of growing international pressure on Moscow with requests to scale back the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.</seg>

<seg id="1">Four people were killed as a result of a series of explosions at resorts in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="2">All at once, several explosions rocked southern Thailand on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four people were killed and 19 were injured as a result of the attack.</seg>
<seg id="4">The epicentre of the explosions occurred in the town of Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ten foreigners, citizens from four states, were among the victims; there were no Russian citizens among them.</seg>
<seg id="6">None of the terrorist groups have taken responsibility for the incident yet, but the Ministry of the Interior was quick to declare that the Islamists had not been involved in it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organising the explosions.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to preliminary information from the local police, the scale and distinctive features of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military running the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">The attacks happened in popular tourist areas such as Patong Beach in Phuket, and in the cities of Hua Hin, Trang, and Surat Thani.</seg>
<seg id="10">After the military junta took over control of the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (in 2012) to 2.8% (in 2015), but tourism remained one of the few sectors that was showing growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">14 million people have already visited the country in 2016, 1.5 million more than the figure for 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">The first individuals suspected of preparing and organising the attacks have already been detained, reported Police Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's too early to talk about motives, he added, but the Ministry of the Interior is 'confident that they are not connected to international extremist groups'.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's too early to draw conclusions, said Mr Patanacharoen.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, we do know that these incidents are not directly linked to any form of terrorism; in fact, they are acts of local sabotage, and we are trying to establish the identity of those who were behind them.</seg>
<seg id="16">The explosions took place on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Sirikit.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Thai junta considers protecting the monarchy one of its main priorities, so the incident was most likely directed against it.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to statements by Police General Sithichai Srisopacharoenrath, the bombs were remotely detonated within a half hour of each other.</seg>
<seg id="19">They were hidden within the trees on busy streets, which were filled with tourists having lunch in restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is already known that one of the four killed was a young Thai woman selling street food.</seg>
<seg id="21">The identities of the remaining victims are still unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign countries.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to the Royal Thai Police, they include four citizens of Germany, three Dutch nationals, two citizens of Italy, and one citizen of Austria.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were no Russian citizens among the victims of the explosions, the press service of the Russian Federal Tourism Agency reported.</seg>
<seg id="24">Local experts have also connected the explosions with the referendum that took place on 7 August, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported the new draft constitution.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was prepared by the constitution drafting committee appointed by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="26">Voters had to decide if they support a system in which the upper house of the parliament is entirely appointed by the military and has a significant role in electing the Prime Minister of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The new system was adopted and it will be tested for the first time during the 2017 parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="28">Recall that, on 22 May 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the commander of the country's army, Prayuth Chan-ocha.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to him, the army was prompted to take this step by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="30">The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed a curfew and censorship, dispersed protesters, and dismissed the upper house of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="31">How Bangkok ended up in a state of emergency</seg>
<seg id="32">In January 2014, the government of Thailand, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, announced the imposition of a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces surrounding the capital.</seg>
<seg id="33">The special security arrangement lasted for 60 days.</seg>
<seg id="34">How two explosions rocked Bangkok.</seg>
<seg id="35">In January 2014, in the heart of Bangkok, two explosions occurred at the Victory Monument, which was one of the main sites of the protest, and as a consequence, 28 people were injured and five of them were in critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="36">The explosions were carried out by unidentified individuals on motorcycles.</seg>
<seg id="37">The authorities increased security measures in the capital and brought in military forces to protect demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="1">The development of terms has begun in Sukhoi Log.</seg>
<seg id="2">Kommersant has learned that the government has been asked to approve a proposal for the terms of an auction for the gold deposit, Sukhoi Log, while preserving two key restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is proposed to bar from the auction companies that are 25% or more foreign-owned and those bidders whose capital will not consist of at least 25% state participation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Industry insiders aren't expecting the government to rewrite the terms, noting that there are already many players that won't risk taking on the complex and expensive project.</seg>
<seg id="5">They could announce the auction in August and hold it in October.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has submitted to the government a draft of the regulation and auction terms for the world's largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia, Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, with 130 million ounces in reserves and resources), said two of Kommersant's sources who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="7">The draft was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them elaborated.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment confirmed to Kommersant that the draft was submitted to the government.</seg>
<seg id="9">The representative in charge of subsoil use, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin, told Kommersant that the official's administrative office has not yet received the draft.</seg>
<seg id="10">‘The auction could be announced as early as August, immediately after a government order is issued, and given the timeframe for the submission of applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender could take place as early as October’, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment said.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to Kommersant, two key requirements for potential participants were preserved in the wording of the version of the draft that was submitted for approval to the ministries and the Federal Executive Authority in July (Kommersant has a copy).</seg>
<seg id="12">The first is that bidders must have a minimum of 25% state participation in their capital.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second is that companies under the control of foreign investors are denied access to the auction, based on an understanding of Federal Law No.57 on investments in strategic entities.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the two articles of the federal law mentioned in the draft, which Kommersant already wrote about on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (a 25% share and higher) are not tax residents of Russia or who have dual citizenship need not be permitted access to the auction.</seg>
<seg id="15">The government has the right to impose such restrictions, given that Sukhoi Log is classified as a federal-status mineral resource (reserves of over 50 tonnes of gold).</seg>
<seg id="16">The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment confirmed that the draft 'contains restrictions on the participation of foreign companies’, but declined to comment on the details in advance of the government order.</seg>
<seg id="17">The requirement of state participation in the capital of auction participants was proposed by Irkutsk Region, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment told Kommersant in December 2015, which was later confirmed by the region's governor, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it had been sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment by his predecessor, Sergei Eroschenko, ‘who had an agreement on investment projects with Rostec’.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kommersant's sources did not specify who lobbied for the restriction on the participation of foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="19">‘But this is in the spirit of the times: to not hand over control of the largest gold deposits in Russia amidst Western sanctions’, argues a Kommersant source familiar with the auction’s preparations.</seg>
<seg id="20">On 1 August, Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, Sergei Donskoy, said that foreigners ‘can enter into a consortium’, if bidders invite them to participate ‘in the capacity of a financial structure and as technology partners’.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kommersant's sources consider it highly unlikely the government will adjust the terms.</seg>
<seg id="22">The industry front-runner for Sukhoi Log is believed to be a consortium of the largest gold mining company in the Russian Federation, PJSC Polyus (which is controlled by Suleiman Kerimov's son, Said), and Rostec.</seg>
<seg id="23">As Kommersant wrote, in July, the partners established a joint venture, CL Gold, which gives Polyus 51% of the shares, and the structure, Rostec RT-Global Resources, 49%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Rostec declined to comment, while Polyus told Kommersant that ‘definitely, they are interested in the asset’ and possess all the necessary expertise and resources for its development.</seg>
<seg id="25">‘But a final decision on the feasibility and form of our participation will be made after the announcement of terms’, Polyus added.</seg>
<seg id="26">ALROSA might participate in the auction, but the decision is up to the government of the Russian Federation, said Kommersant's sources.</seg>
<seg id="27">Russia's GV Gold and Canada's Kinross Gold, which is developing assets in Chukotka Region, have also announced the possibility of participating in the development of Sukhoi Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.</seg>
<seg id="28">Sergei Kashuba, Chairman of the Russian Union of Gold Producers, told Kommersant in December 2015, that investments in Sukhoi Log were valued at between $2.5 and 4 billion.</seg>
<seg id="29">The majority of potential bidders are deterred not only by the investment amount, but also by the complexity of the project: extensive in-mine exploration of reserves and methods for working with complex ores are required, Kommersant's sources in the industry explain.</seg>

<seg id="10">Based on the financials on the website of the funds, Anatoly Gavrilenko (who owns 65% through a controlled LLC) and NPF Gazfond (35%) are the current beneficiaries of their owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, the merger of this group was launched much later than its competitors.</seg>
<seg id="12">For example, NPF Future, under the control of O1 Group, absorbed Stalfond back at the beginning of this year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Currently, this combined NPF is absorbing the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.</seg>
<seg id="14">‘Merging into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary for solving structural problems’, notes the CEO of NPF Future, Nikolay Sidorov.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Safmar pension group has been engaged in active efforts aimed at consolidating funds since April: the European, Education and Science, and Regionfond NPFs should join the ranks of NPF Safmar by the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 2017, NPF Doverie will join them.</seg>
<seg id="17">‘Merging the funds will have the effect of improving risk control, operational processes, and costs’, the Safmar pension group noted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The pause in merging funds that KIT Finance Pension Administrator took could have been caused by several factors, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until recently, NPFs could not redeem more than 40% of the volume of an issue of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively involved.</seg>
<seg id="20">After amendments were made to the Central Bank resolution in March of this year, there are no longer any such restrictions for a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="21">If necessary, an entire issue can be redeemed by one big player’, says Yury Nogin, Director of the Financial Institutions Ratings Group at ACRA.</seg>
<seg id="22">Several heads of the top-15 NPFs by assets named the division of spheres of influence, and, as a result, the appointment of staff in a single fund, which had to be agreed to by the owners of the group, as yet another possible reason for the pause.</seg>
<seg id="23">Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko could not be reached for comment.</seg>
<seg id="24">NPF Gazfond also did not respond to Kommersant's request.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although the consolidation of funds is a time-consuming and expensive affair, this decision will be justified in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sergei Kolesnov, CEO of the consulting firm, Pension Partner, notes that Gazfond Pension Savings has fewer outflows, so the accession will help to stabilise the base of the group's other funds.</seg>
<seg id="27">Moreover, the successful experience of NPFs, KIT Finance and Promagrofond, in generating retail sales of compulsory pension insurance and in using more modern software, will be in demand.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Central Bank's requirements for the activities and personnel of NPFs are constantly growing, so it is impractical to duplicate the infrastructure of the four funds given their unified investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director of Corporate Ratings at Expert RA.</seg>
<seg id="29">‘The effect of cutting out duplicate functions will definitely cover the potential costs of the merger’, notes Mr Mitrofanov.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sergei Okolesnov estimates the cost of merging the four funds at between 30-50 million roubles.</seg>
<seg id="31">‘The cost of maintaining four funds of these sizes amounts to about 400 million roubles a year, so, in the medium term, the consolidation will actually cut the budget by half’, Mr Okolesnov assured.</seg>

<seg id="1">The kindest Disney film, ‘Pete's Dragon’, has been released in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2">The beautiful views of New Zealand, the adorable dragon, the sentimental story, and the country music songs are enough to make one believe in good old-fashioned magic once again, says ELENA KRAVTSUN.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dragon finds the frightened boy, becoming both a gentle caregiver and loyal friend to the young human.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honour of a puppy from a book of fairy tales, plays tag with him, and falls asleep in his embrace.</seg>
<seg id="5">Six years later, with a beard and in a loincloth, he is indistinguishable from that other clever forest rascal, Mowgli.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is in this state that he is found by the redheaded huntress, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while a team led by Gavin (Karl Urban), the brother of her husband, is aggressively clearing the forest.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now, she is faced not only with believing that the dragon exists, but also with helping to save him.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pete goes through a crash course in ‘being human’, surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, live according to a moral code, and smile more brightly than in any advertising.</seg>
<seg id="9">None of the characters look or act too horribly for the audience to really start to hate or fear them.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even Gavin, who unleashes a hunt for the unusual inhabitant of the woods under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.</seg>
<seg id="11">The huge fluffy dragon also turned out to be anything but frightening, with the sweet muzzle of a bulldog, the wingspan of an airplane, and the power of invisibility.</seg>
<seg id="12">The dragon amusingly grunts, purrs, and even snorts, but, thankfully, does not speak; although, the whole time, you want to be petting him, and it is in this sense that he has an obvious advantage over all the other known cinematic dragons.</seg>
<seg id="13">The visual representation of Elliot and his mannerisms create such a high degree of emotional involvement that, in the most intense moments, it's not only the young members of the audience who start desperately bawling their eyes out, but also the adults.</seg>
<seg id="14">The young Oakes Fegley is also surprisingly good in the role of Pete: torn between his potential family and a true friend.</seg>
<seg id="15">While Robert Redford masterfully plays the iconic grandfather, whom literally every child would be glad to have.</seg>
<seg id="16">How did Director David Lowery manage to shoot a fantastically lovable remake of the forgotten Disney film, ‘Pete's Dragon’ (1977), – which was mediocre from start to finish and only remembered for combining animation and live-action film – and turn it into this summer's most heartwarming film?</seg>
<seg id="17">Nothing short of a miracle would have helped.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lowry, in fact, only took two things from the original for his film: the orphan Pete and the dragon.</seg>
<seg id="19">The musical numbers and most of the odd jokes were thrown overboard.</seg>
<seg id="20">Features drawn from ‘Bambi’, ‘E.T.’, and many other cherished children's films can be seen in this kind-hearted tale.</seg>
<seg id="21">Disney Studios continues to successfully expand their gallery of high-quality 21st century remakes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Of course, ‘Pete's Dragon’ is not as stunningly beautiful as ‘The Jungle Book’, and there is no cunning villain, such as Cate Blanchett turned out to be in the role of the stepmother in the new ‘Cinderella’.</seg>
<seg id="23">But this simple-hearted film, in keeping with the best traditions of Disney, is no less successful in helping one to believe in miracles and goodness.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, Director Lowry will get the keys to Disney's magic castle once again for an artistic film adaptation of the story of ‘Peter Pan’.</seg>
<seg id="25">The tandem of David Lowery and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks, tried and tested during ‘Pete's Dragon’, has entered into an ambitious new project about the boy who never grew up from James Barrie's fairy tale by the same name.</seg>

<seg id="1">A new charge will be brought against RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov</seg>
<seg id="2">Lawyers for the RBC journalist, Alexander Sokolov, accused of organising an extremist organisation, reported that the prosecutor's office found mistakes in the case against their client.</seg>
<seg id="3">We only learned that the prosecutor's office had made such a recommendation from investigators yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="4">We were scheduled to participate in a court hearing regarding restrictions on familiarisation with the materials of the criminal case, but the hearing never actually took place, and then the investigators informed us of the recommendation issued by the prosecutor's office’, RBC quotes lawyer, Olga Dinze, as saying.</seg>
<seg id="5">She related that the prosecutor's office pointed out to the investigators the discrepancy between the classification of the case and the materials collected.</seg>
<seg id="6">Now, investigators will have to bridge the gaps in the body of evidence and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.</seg>
<seg id="7">Either the case will fall under a different section of the Criminal Code (CC), or it will stay the same, but with different arguments and new evidence, Ms Dinze clarifies.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Kommersant reported, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded the RBC journalist from a charge worded as ‘undermining the stability of political environment’ and ‘overthrowing the government by illegal means’.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">Kommersant-Boscosport correspondent, ALEXANDER ZILBERT, lived the life of an Olympic athlete in the Olympic Village, inspected Team Russia House, had lunch at the on-site cafeteria, and, after all of this, even passed a WADA test.</seg>
<seg id="2">It seems that life here never stops for a second.</seg>
<seg id="3">Even at night.</seg>
<seg id="4">The last events sometimes end after midnight, after which the athletes still need about one and a half to two hours to return to the Olympic Village.</seg>
<seg id="5">Furthermore, people are constantly checking-in and checking-out of the village, as some athletes leave Brazil after finishing their competitions, while others, on the contrary, have only just arrived here.</seg>
<seg id="6">Well, it's only 7:30 a.m. and all of the heads of the Olympic delegations are crammed into one of the temporary tents.</seg>
<seg id="7">We usually discuss certain mundane operational issues at these meetings, recounts Igor Kazikov, Head of the Sports Delegation of the Russian Olympic Team. In spite of the fact that the building where our people have been housed is considered to be a showpiece – it was one of the first to be commissioned and was shown to all the inspectors – even here, certain deficiencies are constantly being found.</seg>
<seg id="8">One day there's a problem with the hot water, and the next day it's, excuse me, the toilets.</seg>
<seg id="9">We struggled with issues of cleanliness for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="10">At first, no one was even showing up to clean.</seg>
<seg id="11">Then, the cleaners started to show up, but only to spray some kind of substance on the floor, and that was all.</seg>
<seg id="12">Their floors, can't you see, are somehow innovative.</seg>
<seg id="13">Supposedly you can't wash them like a normal person.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sure, we know these kinds of floors: ordinary laminate flooring!</seg>
<seg id="15">In sum, we successfully managed to switch cleaning companies and now everything seems to be OK with this.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Olympic Village is like Yuzhnoe Butovo, a residential district fenced in by mountains on one side and on the other sides, there is an impressive ditch filled here and there with water.</seg>
<seg id="17">Well, for security, there is also a two-metre iron fence around the whole perimeter, along which guards, armed with automatic weapons, stroll.</seg>
<seg id="18">In total, the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3,604 apartments, located inside 31 buildings.</seg>
<seg id="19">A massive Russian flag hangs on one of these 18-storey buildings: this building has been totally handed-over for use by our team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Taking a glance at the small foyer by the entrance, you can immediately identify the problems that are apparently the most pressing for our home team.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two notices are hanging at the front desk: a printed one, ‘Please, do not throw paper in the toilet!’, and a hand-written one, ‘I will accept pins as gifts’.</seg>
<seg id="22">The front desk itself is buried under pamphlets.</seg>
<seg id="23">Their cheerful colours contrast with the titles of the brochures: ‘A guide to infectious diseases for travellers to Rio de Janeiro’; ‘First aid for drowning, choking on a foreign object, loss of consciousness - the steps of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation’; and ‘First aid for burns, heat stroke, fractures, and bleeding’.</seg>
<seg id="24">The inside text is, generally speaking, reassuring.</seg>
<seg id="25">For example, this one: ‘the infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent recovery.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, not everyone can expect a favourable outcome.</seg>
<seg id="27">Of course, Team Russia has a medical centre at its disposal, which is always ready to provide residents of the house with professional assistance, including relaxation and sports massage.</seg>
<seg id="28">Across from the medical centre is our delegation's headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="29">Next to the door, there is an inspirational poster: ‘In spite of everything, we shall prevail!’.</seg>
<seg id="30">And, of course, there is poetry:</seg>
<seg id="31">All the arguments are absolute nonsense!</seg>
<seg id="32">They are only believed by those who are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fewer of us there are, the sweeter the taste of victory: Russia will not back down and will not be broken!</seg>
<seg id="34">And to further raise one's spirits, there hangs an announcement: ‘Dear brothers and sisters!</seg>
<seg id="35">With the blessing of his Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alexeev will perform spiritual care for the athletes of the Russian Olympic Team.</seg>
<seg id="36">Prayer service and other religious rites can be ordered by phone...</seg>
<seg id="37">In fact, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Ceremonies for representatives of all faiths within the village.</seg>
<seg id="38">While Russians, it turns out, are given special treatment: they have their own chapel.</seg>
<seg id="39">In light of congestion on the elevator between the ninth and the fourth floors, I decided to go down the stairs that are recommended for use during a fire.</seg>
<seg id="40">And, in the darkness, I stumbled over bodies laying down on them.</seg>
<seg id="41">By all accounts, it was the staff from the new cleaning company sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the ready, I dare say, at any moment to rush to wash the innovative floors, they had decided to arrange a naptime for themselves directly on the cold steps.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the fourth floor, I had a meeting with a long-time acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach for our trampolinists, who led them to Olympic gold, 16 years ago already, in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="44">He and his pupil, European champion, Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.</seg>
<seg id="45">By and large, there is nothing to complain about, the honoured coach of Russia shares his impressions. We live two to a room, the beds, of course, are almost right up against each other, but it's not critical.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is one bathroom for four people, but at least it's spacious.</seg>
<seg id="47">Of course, the wardrobe is laughable; it's made of cloth and doesn't inspire a lot of confidence, but things can be put in it.</seg>
<seg id="48">‘No, well, can you imagine it? They've run out of tea!’, tennis player, Svetlana Kuznetsova, who met me in the main dining room, says while throwing her hands up in dismay.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's called the main dining room if for no other reason than the fact that it provides 2,7 thousand square meters of space and is ready to accommodate 5 thousand visitors at one time.</seg>
<seg id="50">Here, they produce 60 thousand servings a day absolutely free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="51">The menu options include: ‘The Best of Brazil’, ‘Global Cuisine’, ‘Asian Dishes’, and ‘Pizza and Pasta’.</seg>
<seg id="52">The last option, as I noticed, is very popular with our volleyball players.</seg>
<seg id="53">Having said that, I couldn't find soup, for example, in any one of the areas of the giant restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="54">Who cares about soup?, Kuznetsova says in astonishment, There's no tea!</seg>
<seg id="55">It's a good thing I brought some Chinese tea to brew with me.</seg>
<seg id="56">And a teapot.</seg>
<seg id="57">But, in general, just so you understand, the food at the tennis courts is even worse.</seg>
<seg id="58">Here, there is at least something to choose, despite the unbearable monotony.</seg>
<seg id="59">I personally chose the steamed cod and meatballs in tomato sauce.</seg>
<seg id="60">A sign is situated beside each dish with its name in three languages – English, French, and Portuguese – and it also shows the nutritional value of the item and the presence of allergens.</seg>
<seg id="61">And well, I must confess, it was entirely edible.</seg>
<seg id="62">I don't even understand why there is always such a queue at the local McDonald's.</seg>
<seg id="63">The well-fed, relaxed, and, in a manner of speaking, ‘food drunk’ athletes are awaited at the restaurant exit by our best friends: representatives from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).</seg>
<seg id="64">They cleverly entice with a quiz, the winner of which will receive a tee-shirt.</seg>
<seg id="65">They're luring them in, you could say!</seg>
<seg id="66">To get a gift, you have to correctly answer at least eight out of ten questions.</seg>
<seg id="67">A girl from WADA ambushed me with ‘There are questions in Russian!’.</seg>
<seg id="68">But she didn't ambush the right person.</seg>
<seg id="69">That is to say, I harnessed my patriotic impulse, of course.</seg>
<seg id="70">The situation already took a turn for the worse by the second question: ‘If I received a notification to report to doping control, should I report immediately to the doping control centre?’</seg>
<seg id="71">I settled on option B: ‘No, I have one hour’.</seg>
<seg id="72">I was caught, how to say, off guard.</seg>
<seg id="73">I forgot that there's no sense in waiting for a break from WADA.</seg>
<seg id="74">Essentially, you need to report immediately.</seg>
<seg id="75">Well, by the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation had become entirely critical.</seg>
<seg id="76">For some reason, I thought that if I was having a hard time sticking to a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and, by the way, it is hard for me!), I could use dietary supplements to get ‘extra nutrients to enhance my performance’.</seg>
<seg id="77">But alas, they won't allow it!</seg>
<seg id="78">To be more precise, the answer is formulated in such a way that they don't outright forbid it, but rather, in a few sentences, strongly advise against it.</seg>
<seg id="79">That WADA doesn't play fair!</seg>
<seg id="80">‘So, how's it going, Russia?’, the presenter of the quiz mockingly questions.</seg>
<seg id="81">There was nowhere to hide: behind me were Efimova, Isinbayeva, and the rest of our depleted team.</seg>
<seg id="82">So I buckled down and, using my last ounce of strength, won that pitiful tee-shirt.</seg>
<seg id="83">As the saying goes, let them see what we're made of!</seg>
<seg id="84">In a triumphant mood, I wandered into the nearby fitness centre.</seg>
<seg id="85">I got caught up with counting the fitness machines.</seg>
<seg id="86">I lost track at 250.</seg>
<seg id="87">I noted with surprise that there was not a single Russian athlete to be found among this mass of treadmills.</seg>
<seg id="88">But maybe that's the way it should be?</seg>
<seg id="89">Let those who don't know how to play be the ones who train!</seg>
<seg id="90">However, one of our boys was sitting at the medical clinic located nearby.</seg>
<seg id="91">In line to see the optometrist.</seg>
<seg id="92">Don't worry; he's not a shooter.</seg>
<seg id="93">At the clinic, and for that matter, as with everywhere else you look throughout the village, hangs a device for distributing condoms.</seg>
<seg id="94">It is inscribed with an inspiring appeal: ‘Celebrate with a condom!’</seg>
<seg id="95">Then, you just have to turn a piece of metal resembling the knob of a door lock, and a condom, made of natural latex from the Amazon, readily falls from the device.</seg>
<seg id="96">I took one for myself, as a memento.</seg>
<seg id="97">The athletes won't miss it; they brought in 450 thousand of these for them.</seg>
<seg id="98">In fact, the Olympic Village has a whole recreation centre for celebratory and leisurely pursuits.</seg>
<seg id="99">Beside it, for good measure, there is an informative plaque, reminding that the International Olympic Committee, in various ways, is spending $3.25 million on the athletes per day.</seg>
<seg id="100">The centre is inundated with video games, billiards, ping-pong tables, foosball and air hockey tables, and some odd equipment that looks like video training simulators.</seg>
<seg id="101">‘What is that?’, I ask a comrade in a Ukrainian team uniform, who is actively using the strange toy.</seg>
<seg id="102">Of course, he could have just said that he didn't want to talk to someone in a Team Russia uniform, and that would have been that.</seg>
<seg id="103">Here, incidentally, by some sort of strange set of circumstances, my eyes are sore from all these boys in yellow and blue.</seg>
<seg id="104">A team that never stops playing around, it turns out.</seg>
<seg id="105">It takes no less than three hours to walk around the whole village, exploring every nook and cranny.</seg>
<seg id="106">But, if you walk and don't get a ride in the electric cars, you will discover Team Canada House with a moose at the entrance and a pavilion with a restorative bath, and a ticket office, and a laundromat, and a dry cleaners, and a hair salon, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods, and a post office with unique stamps (only you won't be able to wait out the queue of Chinese stamp collectors anyways), and a bank, and a lost and found, and a photo booth.</seg>
<seg id="107">And in the late evening you, exhausted, will sit down beside an olive tree, decorated with multicoloured ribbons in memory of the athletes' dearly departed friends and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="108">And you, to the accompaniment of a device randomly spraying a liquid to kill insects, will think about eternity.</seg>
<seg id="109">That is to say, about the Olympic movement.</seg>
<seg id="110">Which, in this village, doesn't stop even for a minute.</seg>

<seg id="1">While the rest of the Russian world watched with bated breath as the Australians came close to trouncing the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.</seg>
<seg id="2">Few people know that I was the first to receive the news that Inna Deriglazova had won gold in foil fencing at the XXXI Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">I may even be the only Muscovite who saw how it unfolded, except, of course, for those who were watching the competition that night in Carioca.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only a true fan could understand.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just imagine: it's the dead of the night in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="6">The neighbours downstairs, as per usual, wake up by 1 a.m. and start amicably, but very loudly, shouting at each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">And threateningly moving the furniture.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the kitchen, the faucet is leaking: there hasn't been time to drive to the market and buy a new one like the plumber requested.</seg>
<seg id="9">The TV schedule makes no sense, so I just kept an eye on the channels, Match, First, and, just in case, Russia, although that's almost pointless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Russia channel is the birthplace of reruns: all the sports on there are prerecorded for some reason.</seg>
<seg id="11">TV series are broadcast live on there.</seg>
<seg id="12">I, of course, was counting on Match: the whole evening the young man on the news broadcasts had been shouting first about the great semi-final between Deriglazova and Shanaeva, and then about the impending battle for the gold.</seg>
<seg id="13">It would have made sense to show it.</seg>
<seg id="14">But instead of this, it was basketball between the USA and Australia.</seg>
<seg id="15">By the way, I can't say anything bad about this decision.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Australians were an equal match, and, as a matter of fact, they won the first half.</seg>
<seg id="17">They put the Americans, deluded by grandeur, in their place.</seg>
<seg id="18">They still lost in the end, but, like they're now saying, the Olympic basketball tournament will never be the same again.</seg>
<seg id="19">That's all well and good, but the bout with Di Francisca is drawing near and nothing is changing on the screen.</seg>
<seg id="20">I start flipping through the channels in a slight panic.</seg>
<seg id="21">It feels like they are playing it for the second time in a row.</seg>
<seg id="22">Fine, we'll dig deeper and check the cable channels.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is no fencing on any of the specialty Match channels.</seg>
<seg id="24">But, I have a feeling that the bout is just about to start.</seg>
<seg id="25">I'm not interested in settling for the text and twitter broadcasts of some sports websites.</seg>
<seg id="26">The spastic channel surfing produces an unexpected but brilliant result.</seg>
<seg id="27">It turns out that the First Channel website broadcasts the technical videostream of all events in real time.</seg>
<seg id="28">I click on fencing and get the battle for the gold.</seg>
<seg id="29">Deriglazova mounts a terrific counterattack, moves ahead in points, and, quite obviously, starts to run out the clock.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Italian claws back almost all of the lead.</seg>
<seg id="31">Our girl is one point ahead with just a little more than two seconds to go.</seg>
<seg id="32">Di Francisca lunges at Deriglazova and the latter retreats; time is running out and the Italian makes a play.</seg>
<seg id="33">Victory!</seg>
<seg id="34">A few seconds later, the Olympic messenger on my phone notifies me of the fourth gold medal.</seg>
<seg id="35">As it turns out, I am the first to see it with my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="36">My crazy, loyal, involved eyes.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Muslim Religious Board (MRB) of Tatarstan renounces the use the Russian language in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="2">Yesterday, a plenum of the MRB ordered their imams to lead Friday sermons in Tatar only, to force young Tatars ‘to learn their native language’.</seg>
<seg id="3">The administrative body states that this ‘in no way infringes’ on the rights of Muslims of other ethnicities.</seg>
<seg id="4">Several of the mosques in Kazan have complained that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60% of worshippers, such as foreign students, migrants, and even Tatars themselves.</seg>
<seg id="5">The imams fear that their sermons in Tatar ‘won't reach the entire audience’.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yesterday, a plenum of the MRB of Tatarstan unanimously adopted a decision to hold Friday sermons in the Republic's mosques in the Tatar language only.</seg>
<seg id="7">As stated by the Mufti of Tatarstan, Kamil Samigullin, this should become an incentive to young Tatars ‘to learn their native language’.</seg>
<seg id="8">‘For those who will say that it is “difficult”, we intend to organise absolutely free Tatar language lessons at each of the large mosques’, Mr Samigullin promised.</seg>
<seg id="9">He added that ‘the decision has already come into force’, and, today, sermons in all mosques ‘should already be in the Tatar language’.</seg>
<seg id="10">He reminded that the MRB of Tatarstan publishes the journal, ‘Shura’, with typical sermons in the Tatar language.</seg>
<seg id="11">An imam, who does not speak Tatar well enough, ‘can use them to thoroughly prepare’.</seg>
<seg id="12">The MRB of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand congregations throughout all the municipalities of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the mufti, in the regions, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the other hand, a number of mosques in Kazan previously had been predominantly using the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="15">In particular, as indicated by the mufti, this was the practice at Burnaevskaya Mosque, Zakabannaya Mosque, and at ‘Eniler’.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, Mr Mukhametshin emphasised that the leadership has made it an objective that all students are proficient in both official languages of the Republic, regardless of ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="17">‘This has absolutely nothing to do with infringing on the rights of non-Tatar Muslims’, emphasised Mr Mukhametshin, explaining that the sermon itself ‘is not a mandatory main part of namaz’.</seg>
<seg id="18">In fact, the namaz itself will still be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons at mosques will still be available in the Russian language.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told Kommersant that there was never a serious threat of the Tatar language vanishing from mosques.</seg>
<seg id="20">Except for Russian and Tatar, no other languages, according to him, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are used in sermons in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The decision by the MRB was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT).</seg>
<seg id="22">Chairman of the Executive Committee of the WCT, Rinat Zakirov, told Kommersant: ‘the mosque is an important part of our national life’.</seg>
<seg id="23">It would be a shame if the Tatar language were to disappear from this sphere.</seg>
<seg id="24">He noted that conducting sermons in the Tatar language only, ‘is the will of the imams themselves’, but that the Executive Committee of the WCT ‘considers this to be the right decision’.</seg>
<seg id="25">The imams interviewed by Kommersant who were conducting sermons in Russian, are ready to follow the decision by MRB, however, they believe that the congregation will have difficulty understanding the clerics.</seg>
<seg id="26">Both Tatars and Russians attend mosque.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many don't understand the language.</seg>
<seg id="28">Of course, it's going to be a bit difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="29">‘We're going to have to change our ways’, says the Imam of Burnaevskaya Mosque, Farhat Mavletdinov.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to him, even many Tatars have a closer affinity to sermons in the Russian language, since ‘Russian is what is in schools and in child care facilities, on the radio, and everywhere, from the very beginning’.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, he is under the impression that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in the Russian language, which are held on other days.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have faith in Allah.</seg>
<seg id="33">Allah will show us the way out of this situation’, he concluded.</seg>
<seg id="34">But we have around 60% that don't know the Tatar language.</seg>
<seg id="35">These are Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.</seg>
<seg id="36">A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.</seg>
<seg id="37">‘That is why we switched to the Russian language four years ago’, the imam says.</seg>
<seg id="38">He believes that sermons in the Tatar language will ‘reach a more limited group and will not reach the whole audience’.</seg>
<seg id="39">But we will abide by the decision of the plenum.</seg>
<seg id="40">Simply, the results of the sermons will be different.</seg>
<seg id="41">But time will tell.</seg>
<seg id="42">‘For example, it will only be easier for me, because Tatar is my native language’, concluded Gabdulla Galiullin.</seg>

<seg id="1">The former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) has been taken to court</seg>
<seg id="2">The Moscow Prosecutor's Office has approved an indictment in a criminal case, investigated by the Main Investigations Directorate of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, concerning the embezzlement of budgetary funds allocated for use by the FSIN of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="3">The former head of the prison service, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, will appear before the court, having inflicted damages to the FSIN in an amount of more than 2.7 billion roubles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The capital’s prosecutor's office referred the criminal case against the former director of the FSIN of Russia, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy, Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the director of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise (FSUE), Centre for Information Technology and Communications of the Federal Penitentiary Service (TSITOS), Victor Opredelenov, to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court.</seg>
<seg id="5">Depending on their role and degree of participation in the crimes, they are accused by the Main Investigations Directorate of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for Moscow under Article 285(3) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers entailing grave consequences), and Article 159(4) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using one's official position, in an organised group, on an especially large scale).</seg>
<seg id="6">Furthermore, Krivolapov is charged under Article 222(1) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, between 2010 and 2012, the indicated persons fraudulently stole budgetary funds from the state treasury that were allocated to the FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled individuals, otherwise known as electronic ankle bracelets.</seg>
<seg id="8">To embezzle the budgetary funds, the members of the group developed a scheme whereby FSUE TSITOS, an enterprise controlled by them and with whom relevant government contracts were signed, handled the technical means of control and surveillance, including ‘electronic bracelets’, and charged prices that were inflated several times over.</seg>
<seg id="9">In spite of the fact that FSUE TSITOS had no production equipment, buildings, or structures to house the production facilities necessary to create a complete production cycle for ‘electronic bracelets’, five contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles were signed between it and the FSIN of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles ended up in the accounts of the Samara branch of the FSUE, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="11">As suggested by the investigation, more than 140 million roubles of the cashed money was personally received by Mr Reimer in his official office from one of the accomplices, whose criminal case was severed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ammunition, obtained from an unknown source for a special service award gun, was found in the possession of Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the fraud, which resulted in the laying of additional charges against him.</seg>
<seg id="13">In regards to this case, the size of which amounted to 133 tomes, FSIN has filed a lawsuit against the accused for compensation of material damages in the amount of 2.7 billion roubles.</seg>

<seg id="1">Footballer Hakan Şükür is suspected of involvement in the coup.</seg>
<seg id="2">Turkish authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Hakan Şükür, a former football player and then a member of parliament, and have carried out searches at his family's two houses.</seg>
<seg id="3">A star of Turkish football in the 1990s and early 2000s, striker Hakan Şükür is wanted by authorities in connection with the coup attempt that took place last month.</seg>
<seg id="4">The forward, who ended his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to ‘an armed terrorist group’.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is in reference to the Hizmet Movement: a society associated with the well-known Turkish religious and opposition leader, Fethullah Gülen.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is whom President Erdogan considers to be the organiser of the military coup attempt that occurred on 15 July.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, and Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to local media, today, an arrest warrant was issued for Hakan Şükür, and police have already carried out searches at the two houses that belong to the family of the former football player.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to investigators, in addition to Hakan Şükür, his father was also part of Fethullah Gülen's organisation.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, neither the former football player, nor his relatives were there.</seg>
<seg id="11">Currently, he and his family are living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a football player, Hakan Şükür defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.</seg>
<seg id="13">He spent the better part of his career with Galatasaray.</seg>
<seg id="14">The list of foreign clubs includes Italy's Torino, Inter, and Palermo, as well as England's Blackburn.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although, he never spent more than one season with any of them.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hakan Şükür still holds the title for highest-scoring striker on Turkey's national team: he has 112 matches for the national team under his belt and scored 51 goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2013, Hakan Şükür resigned from his parliamentary post as a result of the initiation of corruption investigations surrounding Erdogan's party and his inner circle.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, on 25 July, arrest warrants were issued for at least 42 journalists in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="19">They are accused of aiding the military coup and having ties to the oppositionist Islamic preacher, Fethullah Gülen, who is living in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Given the gravity of the charges, these members of the media can expect lengthy prison sentences ranging from ten years to several life sentences.</seg>

<seg id="2">The company, Metrostroy, which is the new general contractor for the stadium under construction in Saint Petersburg that is slated to host matches for the 2017 Confederations Cup and the 2018 FIFA World Cup, promises to deliver the arena by 26 December, reports RIA Novosti, with reference to Head of the Temporary Commission of the Federation Council on preparations for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Vadim Tyulpanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">‘Today, Russia’s Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, and I visited the construction site, and Vadim Alexandrov, General Director of Metrostroy, was with us.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said that he will deliver the stadium by 26 December.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a high-profile Saint Petersburg company that never misses a deadline.</seg>
<seg id="6">Vitaly Mutko and I were impressed by what we saw and heard’, the agency quotes its source as saying.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vitaly Mutko arrived in Saint Petersburg earlier in order to inspect the venue for the upcoming large-scale competitions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Tyulpanov also stated that the Federation Council Commission headed by him would continue to monitor the progress of construction of the stadium and would regularly visit the construction site.</seg>
<seg id="9">To recap, yesterday, it came to light that the company, Metrostroy, would complete construction of Zenit Arena; the value of the contract amounts to approximately 5.4 billion roubles. The same company won the bid for the improvement of areas around the stadium, with a contract value of 2.4 billion roubles. The contracts with JSC Corporation Transstroy, JSC Engineering Corporation Transstroy-SPB, and JSC Engineering Corporation Transstroy were terminated.</seg>

<seg id="2">Another lawyer for the accused, Sergei Kolosovsky, told Kommersant-South Ural that Konstantin Akulich was summoned to the Miass branch of the Investigative Committee of Russia today for arraignment on a year-old battery case.</seg>
<seg id="3">At that time, Konstantin Akulich arrived at the scene of a traffic accident, in the capacity of a lawyer, to assist one of the parties to the accident.</seg>
<seg id="4">‘Initially, it was filed against unidentified persons. Then, after he began to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akulich’, says Sergei Kolosovsky.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Copper Company (RMK) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.</seg>
<seg id="2">This is evidenced, for example, by the fact that RMK took on the modernisation of one of the country’s oldest and most ecologically ‘dirty’ enterprises: the Karabash copper smelter.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Karabash copper smelter was founded by an English joint-stock company, headed by Leslie Urquhart, in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Soviet times, it was an industrial enterprise significant to the country's economy and effectively ensured the livelihoods of the entire city.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, in the 1990s, as a result of financial problems, production was stopped, which led to serious social problems in Karabash.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 1998, a decision was made to resume operations at Karabash copper smelter.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was also critical to solve one of the main problems at the Karabash plant: the environmental issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the early 2000s, Karabash was already infamous as an ecological disaster zone.</seg>
<seg id="9">The situation at Karabashmed started to change in 2004, after the enterprise came under the management of Russian Copper Company.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company started to modernise production, which gradually began to reduce the ecological burden on the environment.</seg>
<seg id="11">This was recently noted by Boris Dubrovsky, Governor of Chelyabinsk Region, who visited Karabashmed in the first days of July.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the Southern Urals called the changes that have taken place at the plant, since Karabashmed became a part of the RMK Group, grandiose.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, the flagship modernisation effort at Karabashmed became the construction of a new sulphuric acid plant that allows for the capture of up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Vsevolod Levin, President of Russian Copper Company, the volume of investments in this project amounted to around 7 billion roubles.</seg>
<seg id="15">The next stage of modernisation at ZAO Karabashmed is the reconstruction of converter processing.</seg>
<seg id="16">The replacement of three converters, dust caps, and a flue tract is scheduled for the end of 2017.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.</seg>
<seg id="18">Furthermore, the launch of a new industrial wastewater treatment plant, worth 1 billion roubles, is planned for the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="19">This, in turn, will increase the amount of taxes paid into the budget of the city of Karabash.</seg>
<seg id="20">Over the entire duration of the Tominskiy Mining and Processing Plant project, from the start of construction up until the commissioning of the second phase of the project, the Federal Treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.</seg>
<seg id="21">Once the mining and processing plant is in operation, tax revenues for budgets at all levels could amount to 80.9 billion roubles.</seg>
<seg id="22">Over the first year of production in Varnensky District, 346.3 million roubles were paid into the budgets of different levels of government.</seg>
<seg id="23">And this is just for the first year.</seg>
<seg id="24">‘The longer the enterprise successfully operates, the more money it can contribute’, added Valery Ulanovsky.</seg>
<seg id="25">RMK confirmed that, in 2015, the tax paid by the Mikheevsky Mining and Processing Plant was close to 1 billion roubles.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, the involvement of RMK's enterprises in the life and development of the areas of their operations is not limited to tax contributions.</seg>
<seg id="27">RMK's enterprises are helping to renovate and maintain schools, childcare and sports facilities, build cultural and recreational facilities, and make land improvements.</seg>
<seg id="28">In 2016, one of Russian Copper Company's largest social projects in Karabash involved capital repairs to, or, in reality, the almost complete overhaul of Childcare Facility No. 9, which serves 95 pupils.</seg>
<seg id="29">The building, erected in 1960, was in a sad state of disrepair.</seg>
<seg id="30">The grounds at RMK Arena will also feature a landscaped park with an artificial pond, underground and surface parking for 600 cars, cafes, and sports shops.</seg>
<seg id="31">RMK Arena will make it possible to host exciting, world-class, professional sporting events.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the main goal of this project is ensure that residents of Chelyabinsk, and, first and foremost, the children, have access to engage in physical activity and sports in a comfortable environment.</seg>

<seg id="2">This was reported on 12 August on the court's website.</seg>
<seg id="3">Migulya was found guilty of committing crimes established under Articles 286 ('Excess of power'), 285.1 ('Misappropriation of budgetary funds'), and 285 ('Abuse of official powers') of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="4">The investigation established that, in December 2008, the official provided his friend with a plot of land in the village of Mukhinka in violation of established land legislation procedures.</seg>
<seg id="5">In 2006, he unlawfully issued an ordinance for procurement of a road bridge over the Chigiri River for the city, at an over-inflated price, and without tendering procedures or signing a municipal contract, Interfax clarifies.</seg>
<seg id="6">Moreover, between 2007 and 2010, Migulya, in the interests of a commercial organisation controlled by him, altered the payment dates of a land lease agreement under a purchase and sale agreement, which was granted for the construction of housing, and also absolved the company from paying rent.</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result, the regional budget was short-changed more than 5 million roubles and the city treasury was out by about 21 million roubles.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 4 August, it came to light that the former head of the city was in custody on suspicion of corruption and that he was seeking a seat in parliament, but did not provide the Election Commission with signature sheets for participation in the elections to the State Duma on time, and was removed from the election race.</seg>
<seg id="9">Migulya was arrested in May 2015, in Lipetsk Region, and was placed in a pre-trial detention facility.</seg>

<seg id="2">US officials are considering imposing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of the Democratic Party's servers, writes The Wall Street Journal, citing sources.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to reports, in order to impose sanctions, the administration of President Barack Obama will need to officially accuse Russia of attacking the servers or hackers supported by the Russian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to sources, the FBI and other American intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia's involvement in the cyberattack.</seg>
<seg id="5">The WSJ notes that, generally, the United States prefers not to specifically name those who carry out cyberattacks.</seg>
<seg id="6">An exception was the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s database in 2014, the responsibility for which was officially placed on the DPRK.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions against those who engage in or facilitate cyberattacks.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was originally aimed against China, but it can also be used against other countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">The sanctions decision-making process could be lengthy, the newspaper writes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even if officials come to the conclusion that the hackers were supported by Russia, they will need to weigh the possible consequences before a decision on the disclosure of such information is made.</seg>
<seg id="11">They will need to determine if the incident is serious enough for them to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.</seg>

<seg id="2">The reason was a violation of competition in the mobile applications market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The antitrust proceedings were initiated by Yandex.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Russian company argued that Google grants manufacturers of smartphones access to Android components on terms that prohibited the pre-installation of applications from other developers, and, in particular, Yandex.</seg>
<seg id="5">The FAS has confirmed these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position in the market and forced manufacturers of mobile devices to install other apps alongside the Google Play store.</seg>
<seg id="6">Following the results of the inquiry, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to penalise Google, said Alexey Dotsenko, Deputy Head of the FAS.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fine must be paid within 60 days of the ruling entering into force.</seg>
<seg id="8">The FAS concluded that all companies, including multinationals, must comply with the law on the protection of competition.</seg>
<seg id="9">By the same token, Google intends to first examine the ruling and then determine the next steps to be taken: abide by it or challenge it.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Federal Antimonopoly Service declared the company to be in violation of the competition law back in September of last year and ordered them to adjust their contracts by 18 December.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Google refused to agree to this.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since then, the company and the agency have been involved in litigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The FAS has noted that, in spite of the fine, they are discussing the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement with Google.</seg>

<seg id="15">This is the view expressed to Echo of Moscow by Eldar Murtazin, a leading analyst with Mobile Research Group.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Any missteps quickly enter the public record.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.</seg>
<seg id="8">So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."</seg>
<seg id="9">And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.</seg>
<seg id="12">But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."</seg>
<seg id="25">Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.</seg>
<seg id="28">For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says</seg>
<seg id="2">Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).</seg>
<seg id="27">But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.</seg>
<seg id="28">The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no clue," she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.</seg>
<seg id="10">However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bam was on that team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.</seg>
<seg id="15">The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We've made a complete turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.</seg>
<seg id="21">She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.</seg>
<seg id="24">She is on a roll.</seg>
<seg id="25">So is Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Fury of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a furious relay of competition and striving.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton, passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on a television, read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor's conversation in a coffee-shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr. Dooley, a first-time Olympian and a dimpled heartthrob in the making, may well be among those household names being showcased in prime time, buoyed by sponsorships and feel-good TV commercials, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is competing for the gold in Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in shadow, are those sports not universally acknowledged: air-pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke, and long may it reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite, let me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This may be a regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite sending athletes to compete, the United States has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to split the prizes for the men, and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in part because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">Here I should confess that I am no expert, just an earthbound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampolín, meaning "diving board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air, and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves (twists, pikes and somersaults) before eventually landing on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time," according to the official Olympic program.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal hopefuls must go farther, faster, up and over, in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, other times back and forth up and down the court.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are chasing not only the finish line or the starting wall but also, in the televised coverage, another taunting line: that of the world, or Olympic, record.</seg>
<seg id="28">This single-minded pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to bring even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find slightly exhausting about even watching the Games.</seg>
<seg id="30">From this, trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The trampoliner's vector is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">Forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she rebounds, seeming weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is not without competition, of course, nor without difficulty, but for the duration of a routine, there is no frantic charge toward the end, no vaulting into the distance, just the dreamy, graceful suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as close to Zen as Olympic competition gets.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday, also at 1.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one likely to be overlooked in the general melee.</seg>
<seg id="39">And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"A Generation Is Protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent Protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia about to crack?</seg>
<seg id="6">For the last decade, it has been one Africa's most stable nations, a solid Western ally with a fast-growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, anti-government protests have convulsed the country, spreading into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last week alone, thousands of people stormed into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government response, according to human rights groups, was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos circulating from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers whipping young people with sticks as they were forced to perform handstands against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa, after Nigeria, and its stability is cherished by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy has been expanding at an impressive clip.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">And its streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many have been exiled, jailed, killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that may be changing.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If you suffocate people and they don't have any other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">The complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle along that jagged, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years, like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why bitter feelings, after years of simmering beneath the surface, are exploding now.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it frequently does, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="35">Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is changing as well.</seg>
<seg id="38">"We are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents.</seg>
<seg id="45">"The current regime lacks that ground savvy," Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">The result, many fear, is more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently said it closed that base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.</seg>
<seg id="59">"That," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very tight rope to walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump Explains His Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="3">The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also put his surrogates, who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch, in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the suggestion at a rally on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump doubled down on the assertion on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did intend to say that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early-morning Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he was just being sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave dueling economic speeches in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to that subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Taking again to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.</seg>
<seg id="14">In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of toning things down for a general election audience, Mr. Trump has taken an even more caustic tone in recent days as his poll numbers have continued to tumble.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remarks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, political commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in a sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small little organization, he who called it the jayvee, totally wrong, and here's why it happened, because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try to figure him out and said, "They can't!"</seg>
<seg id="28">Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once Priced Out, a Cafe Returns in Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Naturally, it got priced out of its Bedford Avenue storefront.</seg>
<seg id="4">The store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">Leading the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost, he said he was excited to do it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even reused the lights from the old Verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Mr. Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are brown-rice bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nine months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.</seg>
<seg id="23">"A lot of former customers got priced out of Williamsburg too," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ms. Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb frequently.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would still make the trek.</seg>
<seg id="27">After Verb closed, she said, she gave up drinking coffee for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I realized it was the coffee and the culture at Verb that I liked," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she's back on coffee, although that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, went faithfully to Verb starting in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He'd go before work and order the same thing without fail.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Quarter past seven, every day, like clockwork, I'd come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">These days, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his regular order, but sometimes he'll switch things up with the bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mr. Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, using the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we still might take them up on it," Mr. Rodriguez said.</seg>
<seg id="38">And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well.</seg>
<seg id="39">One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The new location has other perks.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I've needed to smell that," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."</seg>
<seg id="9">Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.</seg>
<seg id="12">When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Coe grimaced.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.</seg>
<seg id="35">Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was fabulously out of touch.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the cream-puff incident.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.</seg>
<seg id="52">Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.</seg>
<seg id="53">Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.</seg>
<seg id="54">Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."</seg>

<seg id="3">In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate</seg>
<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="16">Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.</seg>

<seg id="5">Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of the animals.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">The first two steps involve shining a torch at the trespassing elephant and sounding a horn.</seg>
<seg id="8">If it is not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.</seg>
<seg id="9">Chilli powder mixed with soil is packed with a firecracker into a condom, its end is twisted shut with just the fuse exposed.</seg>
<seg id="10">When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="5">The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?</seg>
<seg id="7">Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."</seg>
<seg id="11">The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were appalled and shocked by the incident.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is in itself a great shame.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">That needs no explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trade between Russia & Iran surges 71% - RT Business</seg>
<seg id="2">With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year-on-year terms, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been a surge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies are resuming existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to get access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and amounted to $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">The boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel, to Iranian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I can personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The state continues to tighten the screws on the military-industrial complex.</seg>
<seg id="2">‘Systematic failure to implement’ the orders of the director general of Almaz-Antey Concern, ‘shortcomings in work’, and ‘a loss of trust’ were the grounds for the dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of the scientific production association for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="4">Information about Neskorodov's dismissal only appeared on Thursday evening and didn't evoke a wide response in the media.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can such silence in the face of a major rearmament of the military be explained?</seg>
<seg id="6">Most likely, the Russian leadership does not want any rumours or negative speculation circulating in the public sphere.</seg>
<seg id="7">This, once again, confirms that there are many problems within the military-industrial complex (MIC), and the government does not want to attract the public's attention to them.</seg>
<seg id="8">The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event from the perspective of restoring order in the industry.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Almaz Scientific Production Association is the concern's principal enterprise, which specialises in the production of sea and land-based air defence missile systems (ADMS).</seg>
<seg id="10">Currently, Almaz is working on the development of the Poliment-Redut and Morpheus ADMSs, which are slated to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers, and cruisers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dmitry Kornev, founder of the internet portal, Military Russia, believes that Neskorodov's dismissal was brought about by a failure to meet the delivery deadlines for these projects.</seg>
<seg id="12">This theory is the most logical.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, the development of Morpheus began back in 2007, and it was expected to be put into commission in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">Poliment-Redut is set to be the main antiaircraft defence system on the Navy's newest vessels.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the information I'm receiving, over several years of testing, there hasn't been a single truly successful test.</seg>
<seg id="16">Granted, as far as I can gather, Almaz is not entirely to blame for this, Kornev said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The expert fears that a delay could also occur in the commissioning of the S-500 ADMS.</seg>
<seg id="18">Development and engineering work on the project is still not completed, but the first systems are supposed to be operational in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Ministry of Defence assured that ‘work is going according to plan and everything will be completed within the prescribed time limits’, although, in 2014, the department admitted that there are problems with the development of the S-500.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is extremely difficult to assess the professional abilities of Neskorodov, who had been in charge of Almaz since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kornev noted that the failure to meet delivery deadlines for the projects could be both a pretext and the reason for the dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his opinion, over the past few years, it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about the internal dealings of the military industrial complex and about the management plans of enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="23">The industry received long-term contracts worth tens of billions of roubles, and, as is well know, big money loves peace and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a rule, directors of defence companies resign from a post of their own accord, according to an agreement of mutual understanding between the parties, or are transferred to another job.</seg>
<seg id="25">In this case, the removal happened publicly, even if it didn't evoke a response.</seg>
<seg id="26">This suggests that the head of Almaz was, perhaps, an obstinate figure, and resisted an ‘order’ issued from above.</seg>
<seg id="27">It would appear that the state no longer intends to put up with such behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="28">It will use the shareholders to remove those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defence’s directives and do not fulfil assigned tasks.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the same time, the Russian leadership is aiming to punish managers who have been caught stealing (fraud at the Zvezda shipyard).</seg>
<seg id="30">The President is personally paying greater attention to problems in this sector.</seg>
<seg id="31">Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Kremlin defends a number of managers in the military-industrial complex, with the aim of having a loyal group of directors on hand, who will implement orders received from above.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a far from ideal policy, but amidst rampant corruption and the absence of real competition in the military-industrial complex, the state doesn't have any other instruments.</seg>
<seg id="34">Of course, the current situation in the defence industry isn't catastrophic, but the present geopolitical environment is galvanising the Kremlin to whip the Armed Forces into shape as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Alongside the ‘crackdown’ on managers in the military-industrial complex, the Russian leadership is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.</seg>
<seg id="36">The army's professional personnel have acquired a new level of quality since the advent of Sergei Shoigu to the post of defence minister.</seg>
<seg id="37">You get the impression that the President has taken to heart the famous expression: ‘If you want peace, prepare for war’.</seg>
<seg id="38">During the Cold War, the military might of the USSR and nuclear parity reached in the 1970s, led to the signing of the Helsinki Pact, which cemented Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.</seg>
<seg id="39">For all of the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.</seg>
<seg id="40">The absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East were proof of this.</seg>
<seg id="41">The triumph of the ‘winners’ of the Cold War eventually turned into a strengthening of international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="42">Following a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States, there is probably not a single peaceful corner left in the ‘civilised world’.</seg>
<seg id="43">In spite of this shared peril, the West refuses to engage with Russia as an equal partner.</seg>
<seg id="44">In such circumstances, the only allies our country has left are the navy and the army.</seg>
<seg id="45">A military build-up will enable Moscow to effectively advance national interests and break new ground in global affairs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.</seg>
<seg id="4">Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.</seg>
<seg id="5">And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.</seg>
<seg id="6">The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel for gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There's no better way to win it.</seg>
<seg id="20">After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."</seg>
<seg id="24">We all as a team came together in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as Hoy's.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You get to win it with your mates.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="39">They finished in 3:51.943.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.</seg>
<seg id="46">There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.</seg>
<seg id="6">As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.</seg>
<seg id="24">And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Not just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall's on the cover of September's Vogue</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of mother-manager Kris's Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of US Vogue's coveted September issue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In a room with a bunch of people I love, looking at this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because, with a spot on Vogue's September issue, we have surely entered a new era of Kardashian.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her to the cover of Vogue (she shared it with husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a league unto itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September Issue is Vogue's highest selling edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista counted 615 of last year's 832-page tome as advertising content).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that, in the past two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities."</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured in 2013, the year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But, even on the off-chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakout model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in pretty good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are legitimately talented women, excelling in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, not everyone is pleased about Jenner's success.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality television history, Jenner's position within the fashion world was always going to be fraught.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them the "bitches of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">This sentiment has boiled up again with the news of Jenner's Vogue cover appearance.</seg>
<seg id="23">But dwelling on the discontent seems beside the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">She is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She's walking for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She's selling you Estee Lauder foundation.</seg>
<seg id="28">She, and all of her sisters, are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywalled apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she photographed to LOVE magazine.</seg>
<seg id="30">And, in her downtime, possibly just as a way still to see sister Kourtney and her kids, she's on reality television.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.</seg>

<seg id="2">New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."</seg>
<seg id="5">The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="6">After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="8">The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="13">WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="14">A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.</seg>

<seg id="1">Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow</seg>
<seg id="2">Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a "cat-and-mouse game," according to one of the companies that makes that software.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix soon.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">Globally, roughly 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year from Pagefair and Adobe; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company is going after ad blockers on desktop however, because mobile ad blockers are not effective in Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Desktop ads still account for enough revenue that Facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would be updating its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This isn't a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.</seg>
<seg id="9">A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was it possible to avoid impact?</seg>
<seg id="12">That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="3">Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="6">To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="7">He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">These conditions are not currently met.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.</seg>
<seg id="11">We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.</seg>
<seg id="13">He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.</seg>
<seg id="15">A Hall of Fame goaltender, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two apiece with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.</seg>

<seg id="2">Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.</seg>
<seg id="6">The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.</seg>
<seg id="11">Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">They're spinning as fast as they ever will.</seg>
<seg id="8">At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="2">A decision was made at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.</seg>
<seg id="3">The contract with him will last for two years, until the end of the 2018 World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="4">On 11 August, the Executive Committee of the RFU appointed Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.</seg>
<seg id="5">He is a well-known footballer, who formerly played for Spartak Moscow in the position of goalkeeper, and is also a coach with solid experience, who was the trainer for such Russian teams as the one and very same Spartak, Zhemchuzhina-Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dynamo, and also Legia Warsaw, which won the national championship and the country's cup.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and that it will last two years.</seg>
<seg id="7">As such, the responsibility falls on him to prepare the team for the 2018 World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's known that Miroslav Romaschenko, Gintaras Staučė, and Vladimir Panikov will be part of his coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is information that suggests that the salaries for the whole coaching staff will amount to 2.6 billion euros a year.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to media sources, the leadership of the RFU has set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to get the Russian national team to the semi-finals and to win medals.</seg>
<seg id="11">The coach himself stated that he considers creating a competitive environment on the team as a matter of priority and is going to give the football players an opportunity to prove themselves.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, according to Cherchesov, he's happy that he was the one chosen.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Russian team will have its first match under the direction of Cherchesov on 31 August, in Antalya: it will be a friendly match against the Turkish team.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recall that the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was previously held by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching the CSKA club.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sandwiched between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.</seg>
<seg id="2">However, after attaining independence from South Africa in 1990, this country, with a population of 2.4 million people, has achieved tremendous success, especially over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="3">The main reason for Namibia's success is that the government pays a lot of attention to education.</seg>
<seg id="4">While people in developed countries take for granted free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries, secondary and even elementary schools require tuition fees.</seg>
<seg id="5">Furthermore, governments are often advised to introduce fees for education for the purpose of ‘cost recovery’.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Namibia, however, education in primary schools is free.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, starting in 2015, secondary education also became free.</seg>
<seg id="8">The country's leaders are also actively working on other important areas.</seg>
<seg id="9">Efforts to eliminate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97% over the past ten years.</seg>
<seg id="10">In contrast to the international trend of growing inequality, in Namibia, it is shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="11">Compared to the figure for 1993, the Gini coefficient, which is the standard measure of inequality in income distribution, fell by 15 points.</seg>
<seg id="12">Back then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="13">While the poverty rate has fallen from 69% in 1993, to less than 30%.</seg>
<seg id="14">The number of people living in conditions of abject poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also fallen from almost 53% to less than 23%.</seg>
<seg id="15">Namibia also has the highest rating for freedom of speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.</seg>
<seg id="16">The country is significantly ahead of the United States and other wealthy countries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Additionally, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Corruption Perceptions Index, which is compiled by human rights activists from Transparency International.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia manages to maintain high growth rates.</seg>
<seg id="19">Meanwhile, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than a 1/3 of the level of debt in the United States and in the majority of European countries.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, Namibia still has some problems.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional assessment methods, still remains quite high at almost 28%.</seg>
<seg id="22">Also, as with other countries in the region, there is a high incidence of HIV/AIDS in Namibia: almost 17% of the population are infected.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the World Bank, Namibia belongs to the group of upper middle-income countries, but the authorities insist that their state is actually a developing country.</seg>
<seg id="24">Namibia, of course, faces some difficulties that are typical of underdeveloped economies.</seg>
<seg id="25">The state has to develop a very big and arid country with a small population.</seg>
<seg id="26">Isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers, which somehow need to be integrated into modern society without losing their identity, live throughout the country in deserts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The integration of people who, a quarter of a century ago, were on the periphery of the world economy, is a difficult task for any country.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is even more difficult for Namibia: like every other country in the world, it is being faced with the consequences of climate change.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, Namibia never thought of giving up; the country is dealing with the problems it faces.</seg>
<seg id="30">Almost immediately after attaining independence, the authorities got to work on creating a diversified economy and a cohesive society.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is noteworthy that competing political factions came together to work for the common good.</seg>
<seg id="32">Indeed, Namibia provides inexpensive medical services not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="33">About 15-20% of visitors to medical facilities in the northern areas of Namibia are Angolan citizens.</seg>
<seg id="34">No one in Namibia talks about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="35">Namibians understand that you can't choose your neighbours, and, as such, decided not to pick a fight with them, but to cooperate instead: to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional health projects, to promote investments and the exchange of students.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition to this, the Namibian government rightly decided that rich natural resources can just as easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of a few at the expense of many.</seg>
<seg id="37">The authorities understand that the profits from Namibia's natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.</seg>
<seg id="38">They also realise that it would be irresponsible not to try and maximise profits from the sale of the country's resources, and are revising investment laws and production contracts to make sure that this is being done.</seg>
<seg id="39">Transparency is critical to this process, and that is why the government's strong support for freedom of speech is so important.</seg>
<seg id="40">As the head of state, Hage Geingob, noted, the media often says things he doesn't like.</seg>
<seg id="41">But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia needs to protect the freedoms it has gained, the President says.</seg>
<seg id="42">Not all of Namibia's key resources are non-renewable.</seg>
<seg id="43">Some of them, such as the fishing industry, are renewable, and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.</seg>
<seg id="44">Every year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.</seg>
<seg id="45">Namibia demonstrates that even those countries that begin with serious flaws – racism, colonial systems, inequality, and a low level of development – can embark on a path to shared prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="46">Its achievements deserve international recognition and emulation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Many have heard about the ‘Varna Gold’, the earliest gold objects created by man (4600-4200 BC).</seg>
<seg id="2">It was probably the biggest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during excavations of the Varna Necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artefacts were found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilogrammes.</seg>
<seg id="3">990 gold objects, weighing more than 1.5 kg, were recovered from just one burial site, known as ‘Grave No. 43’.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the official title of oldest gold in the world may soon be handed over to a rather insignificant-looking bead found by archaeologists in July of this year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Notably, it was also found in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunatsite.</seg>
<seg id="6">Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunatsite is located inland, near the village of Yunatsite in Pazardzhik District.</seg>
<seg id="7">The bead is made from a gold band rolled into a ring.</seg>
<seg id="8">Yavor Boyadzhiev, leader of the excavation at Tell Yunatsite, has dated the find at 4600 BC and said that it's older than the gold of Varna by at least 200 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">The treasures of Varna, you will recall, date from around the same period, 4600-4200 BC.</seg>
<seg id="10">Currently, no technology exists that makes it possible to date metal with perfect accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="11">So, where is the certainty about which gold is more ancient coming from?</seg>
<seg id="12">Obviously, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters news agency: ‘I am absolutely sure that the Yunatsite gold is older than the Varna gold’.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is a discovery of extraordinary importance: it looks like a tiny object, but it is big enough to take its rightful place in history.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev announced that, in the near future, scientists will analyse the composition of the metal, and will once again examine, and this time more thoroughly, the archaeological layer where the gold artefact was found.</seg>
<seg id="15">This will help to date the bead as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">The location of the find also explains a lot.</seg>
<seg id="17">Tell Yunatsite is a well-known settlement, even if you've never heard of it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Currently, Tell Yunatsite is considered to be the most ancient ‘city’ in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.</seg>
<seg id="20">Over the course of the following centuries, metalworking rapidly developed in this region: from the acquisition of the first metallurgical skills, to the creation of a full-fledged industry.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the local historiography, there is a special name for this archaeological community: the Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the 5th millennium BC, urban settlements started to emerge around the metalworking centres.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now they are called the most ancient cities of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Tell Yunatsite is quite possibly the most ancient of them all, given that artefacts from 4900 BC have been found here.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would call Tell Yunatsite a prototype of the modern city, despite the fact that it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.</seg>
<seg id="26">‘This place is older than Sumer by a thousand years’, says Boyadzhiev, bearing in mind the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in Southern Mesopotamia, which is modern Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="27">That is where the first cities, in the usual sense of the word, arose.</seg>
<seg id="28">The excavation of Tell Yunatsite has been underway since 1976.</seg>
<seg id="29">During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about one third of the total estimated area of the settlement.</seg>
<seg id="30">The remains of a fortress wall, which, at one time, reached a height of three metres, were discovered.</seg>
<seg id="31">Little has survived from the houses and workshops, but archaeologists can distinctly make out streets, public buildings, dense urban housing, a ‘business centre’, and residential suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="32">Tell Yunatsite is often called the ‘Bird City’: dozens of clay bird figurines were found here.</seg>
<seg id="33">All of the birds were depicted at rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but rather the subject of a local cult.</seg>
<seg id="34">The ‘Bird City’ was destroyed around 4100 BC, possibly by Indo-European tribes that came from the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="35">The nomads didn’t have cities, but did have horses and weapons.</seg>
<seg id="36">The three-metre-high fortress walls didn't stop them.</seg>
<seg id="37">Archaeologists have discovered obvious signs of a brutal massacre: the remains of elderly people, women, and children, with evidence of wounds inflicted by battle-axes, were found inside of the houses.</seg>
<seg id="38">New discoveries and new facts are emerging every year, changing the accepted understanding of the ancient history of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the ‘lost’ first civilisation of Europe that originated in the Balkans.</seg>
<seg id="40">The ‘Varna Gold’, found relatively recently, in 1972, became a powerful stimulus in the search for this civilisation.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is logical that something had to precede the golden luxury of Varna: something like a tiny gold bead created in Tell Yunatsite.</seg>

<seg id="2">It has been officially announced that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being hand-finished by experts from the division that works with production vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="3">The ‘retro look’ is achieved, for example, by using the special Blue Etna colour on the body, which was developed back in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model; even the logo of this model is painted in this colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">Additionally, the Targa received the signature white graphics along its sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel rims, as well as some parts of the body design painted in ‘white-gold metallic’.</seg>
<seg id="5">The retro feel is considerably less noticeable in the interior: essentially, it is distinguished by its grey-blue tones, the new power seats with extended range, and finishes like the black anodised steel door sill guards with the logo of the division.</seg>
<seg id="6">To top it off, when purchasing this limited edition, each buyer will receive a free vehicle cover and a richly decorated album containing photographs of the production process.</seg>
<seg id="7">The experts at Porsche Exclusive didn't even lay their hands on the powertrain: the characteristics of the retro Targa are exactly the same as the standard production model.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is equipped with a 3.0-litre, six-cylinder turbocharged engine, producing 420 hp and 500 Nm.</seg>
<seg id="9">The most dynamic version is the 911 Targa 4S, which is capable of accelerating to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released as a limited edition, but neither the number, nor the cost of each specific sports car have been reported.</seg>

<seg id="1">Facebook and ad blockers have unleashed an ‘arms race’</seg>
<seg id="2">Facebook's recent introduction of a technology, which prevents the hiding of advertisements on pages of the social network, has sparked a tit-for-tat response from developers of ad-blocking technologies.</seg>
<seg id="3">AdBlock Plus has released an ‘antidote’, but Facebook plans on making even this useless before long.</seg>
<seg id="4">So, AdBlock Plus advertised their new technology, which is unlikely to remain effective for long</seg>
<seg id="5">Representatives from the social network noted that, in an effort circumvent the new technology of ‘unblockable’ advertisements, AdBlock Plus' technology also blocks regular posts from friends and pages in addition to commercials.</seg>
<seg id="6">Facebook expressed regret about the policy of AdBlock Plus and promised to fix the problem shortly.</seg>
<seg id="7">A source within the developers of the social network told the publication, ‘TechCrunch’, that a code, which will make AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop version of Facebook, will be ready within the next few hours.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of ‘arms race’, trying to one-up each other: the aggrieved party turned out to be the users, who missed interesting posts from their friends or saw advertisements where they weren't used to seeing them.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ethical aspects of blocking advertisements have caused heated arguments as of late.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dongfeng will bring the Fengguang 370 crossvan and the Rich New pickup truck to Russia – Za Rulem website www.zr.ru</seg>
<seg id="2">The Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is representative of a class of automobiles, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover, which is gaining popularity in China.</seg>
<seg id="3">Another new model announced for Russia is the Rich New pickup truck.</seg>
<seg id="4">Many Western companies decided to ignore the Moscow International Motor Show this year, so Chinese companies will fill up the empty spaces at Crocus Expo's exhibition halls.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, a strong showing will be made by the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has big plans for the Russian market and intends to offer our car enthusiasts a number of interesting new models in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="6">One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossvan, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (slightly less than 550 thousand roubles at the current exchange rate).</seg>
<seg id="7">It's doubtful that Russian citizens will every see it at that price, and the issue of delivery into our country is still in the discussion stage.</seg>
<seg id="8">In China, by the way, the Fengguang 370 managed to take 11th place on the list of best-selling minivans according to June sales, even though, given its high ground clearance (175 mm) and protective, plastic lower-body moulding, it could also be classified as a crossover.</seg>
<seg id="9">The crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the older Fengguang 360 model: the 370 has the same wheelbase, 2,725 mm, but its body is slightly longer (4,565 mm to 4,510 mm), it has a more solid design, and is better equipped.</seg>
<seg id="10">The interior is decorated with wood panelling, but a photo showing a large vertical touch screen, ‘like a Tesla’, in the centre console was only included in the early exhibition models of the crossvan, whereas the ‘sound system’ in vehicles for sale is more basic.</seg>
<seg id="11">Five of the seven seats easily fold to produce a flat loading area with a length of 1,650 mm, while the maximum trunk capacity is 1,500 L.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Fengguang 370 is fitted with just one 1.5 L gasoline ‘aspirated’ engine, with 115 hp of output, connected to a 5-speed manual transmission.</seg>
<seg id="13">The manufacturer is coyly silent about the performance qualities of the car, but promises to be merciful on the owner's budget with an appetite of just 6.7 L/100 km.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Rich New pickup truck is familiar to Russians as the previous generation Nissan NP300 Navara, but with a design that has been slightly refined by Chinese stylists.</seg>
<seg id="15">In spite of the outdated design, this model still enjoys a steady demand among Chinese consumers as a reliable and low-maintenance ‘workhorse’.</seg>
<seg id="16">At a similar price, the Rich New will surely be of interest to Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Rich New comes equipped with two choices of engines: a 2.4 L gasoline engine (137 hp) or a 2.5 L turbodiesel engine (116 hp).</seg>
<seg id="18">It only comes in a standard transmission with rear-wheel drive, but there are upgrades and an option of part-time 4WD.</seg>
<seg id="19">The new flagship A9 sedan will also be at the Dongfeng booth; a representative from the Chinese company announced its Russian premiere back in June.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are increasingly more minivan-type crossovers in the Chinese market; some of the latest new models are the Cowin V3 and the X7 SWM.</seg>
<seg id="21">Currently, Dongfeng's Russian line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.</seg>
<seg id="22">Over the first seven months of this year, dealers for the Chinese company sold 696 vehicles in our country.</seg>

<seg id="1">Transport tax notices will no longer be sent by mail – Za Rulem website www.zr.ru</seg>
<seg id="2">The tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending tax assessment notices.</seg>
<seg id="3">All Russian automobile owners have become accustomed to the system, which has not changed in years: in the summer and fall, they receive a transport tax bill in the mail for the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, this year, many of them will be waiting for nothing.</seg>
<seg id="5">The fact is that the tax inspectorate has quietly changed the procedure for notifying citizens.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those who signed up for a ‘Personal Taxpayer Account’ on the agency's official website, nalog.ru, will receive notifications in electronic form.</seg>
<seg id="7">The inspectorate automatically considered those Russians citizens as online users and deleted them from the standard ‘paper’ mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="8">This new way of doing things will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Everyone else will receive the same familiar letters as before.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it is possible for website account holders to go back to the old system.</seg>
<seg id="11">To do this, they must visit an office of the tax service during August and file a request.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the one hand, the new process is more modern and convenient.</seg>
<seg id="13">A notification will appear on the ‘personal account’ right after it is prepared, whereas a letter will have to travel several days and can even be lost altogether.</seg>
<seg id="14">On top of that, the number of users of the tax inspectorate's internet service has grown to more than 18 million people, which enables the agency to save substantially on postage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the other hand, the meagre news on the inspectorate's website is clearly insufficient to inform citizens about the changed process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Some people could have registered for a ‘personal account’ for a one-time service and have long since forgotten about it.</seg>
<seg id="17">These people will not receive notification by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the same category as tax evaders, with all the ensuing consequences.</seg>
<seg id="18">Access to the ‘Personal Taxpayer Account’ can be achieved three ways: through a user account on the gosuslugi.ru portal, by using an electronic signature, or by entering the login and password specified on a registration card.</seg>
<seg id="19">The latter can be obtained in-person at any tax office (regardless of place of registration).</seg>
<seg id="20">It bears reminding that, this year, the transport tax must be paid by 1 December.</seg>
<seg id="21">The mail out of notifications began in July.</seg>

<seg id="1">The souped-up Mercedes-Benz G class, whose improvements are aimed at achieving very high performance, is a thing in itself.</seg>
<seg id="2">But the controversial concept did not confound the experts at the company, G-Power, who tackled the redesign of the sport version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.</seg>
<seg id="3">G-Power is known for its proclivity for BMW vehicles, but, at the end of the day, to their experts, a vehicle is a vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="4">Indeed, why not improve the G 63: a 571-hp flying sledgehammer, with the aerodynamics of a tank, that goes from zero to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?</seg>
<seg id="5">To beef up the ‘muscles’ of this crazy ‘Gelik’, the experts took advantage of the benefits offered by the 5.5-litre supercharged V8 engine.</seg>
<seg id="6">Well, the speed at which it accelerates from zero to a hundred improved by an indiscernible 0.1 second: now the flying ‘brick’ is capable of hitting 100 in 5.3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mind you, acceleration at average speeds is, for sure, discernibly easier for it.</seg>
<seg id="8">The top speed is terrifying: while the standard G 63 can't go faster than 210 km/h, the souped-up SUV, with a deactivated electronic ‘collar’, is capable of hitting 250 km/h.</seg>
<seg id="9">From the outside, the vehicle is almost indistinguishable from the factory original, with the exception of different wheel rims: 23-inch Hurricane RR with 305/35ZR23 size tyres.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luxury division, Mercedes-Maybach, has announced a striking, 6-metre-long concept coupe, which will be unveiled at the Concours d'Elegance in Pebble Beach.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mercedes-Benz intends to compete with the ‘green sub-brand’, BMW i, and will promote their electric models under a separate brand.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the coming years, the debut of at least four new eco-friendly models is expected.</seg>
