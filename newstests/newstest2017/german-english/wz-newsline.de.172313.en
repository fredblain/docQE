What the jungle camp has got to do with missing swimming medals
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has posted on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at the Olympics.
In December 2014 he got his first gold medal at the Short Course Swimming Championships in Doha, while setting his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has come forward on Facebook to defend his ex-teammates from criticism.
"In a country in which an Olympic champion is awarded 20,000 euros and the King of the Jungle gets 150,000 euros, nobody should wonder why medals aren't being won," the 26-year-old wrote on Thursday night on his Facebook page.
The remuneration system in swimming is poor, but doping tests, on the other hand, are very good, he says.
This means that we cannot compete with countries who pay a lot and that don't pay as much attention to doping, or even encourage it.
"I'm not saying that we should stop our tests," he went on to explain.
If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to register with the National Anti-Doping Agency for Germany (NADA) nine months before he started.
This is exactly how it should be with countries.
"If you don't submit to WADA/FINA checks a particular amount of time before the World Championships/Olympics, then you shouldn't be able to take part," the Hamburg resident stated, who now runs an ice-cream parlour.
