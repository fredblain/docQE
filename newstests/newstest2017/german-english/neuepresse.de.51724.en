Incident - Bus slips into a ditch in Krummhörn: eight people injured
On Thursday, an accident involving a coach carrying 43 elderly people in Krummhörn (district of Aurich) led to eight people being injured.
Two of the passengers suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
The 66-year-old bus driver, employed by a coach company based in Eisenach, said that she had to swerve to avoid an oncoming lorry that was partly on the wrong side of the road.
The bus came off the right-hand side of the road, and skidded into a ditch, a spokeswoman for the police force of Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"As a result of the way the bus was positioned, people were not able to leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire brigade freed the passengers.
Six rescue vehicles and an ambulance were in attendance at the scene of the accident on the no.2 road.
Uninjured passengers were transported back to Krummhörn's Pewsum district by regular bus.
They waited there until a replacement bus was sent by the coach company.
Investigators are asking the lorry driver and any witnesses to make themselves known to the police.
