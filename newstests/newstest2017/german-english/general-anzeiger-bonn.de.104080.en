Law are constantly being passed in the name of anti-terrorism.
After the most recent attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now putting forward a host of security measures.
But what does residential status have to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner have to say about it all?
Thomas de Maizière is playing the conciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, the Federal Minister of the Interior said when revealing his new security package.
They are not asking too much of anyone.
Other, more wide-reaching issues will first be discussed within the parties.
I will also be involved in that.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he is responsible for results, and for reaching an "achievable agreement" within the coalition, he says.
After the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière let a little time pass before announcing his conclusions for security within Germany.
However, they are more comprehensive as a result.
One thing was already known, announced, heralded: The fact that a new security agency is going to work on cracking encrypted communications is not new.
Neither is the fact that Germany will have to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and gun laws.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies also does not come as a surprise.
To some extent, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that the SPD long wanted nothing to do with: He wants to penalise advertising for terrorist groups, and remove German passports from jihadis with dual citizenship.
"They will be difficult issues for the SPD," admitted the CDU politician.
Despite this, he believes they are achievable, and is not demanding anything that has no chance with the coalition partner.
De Maizière also presented a few new ideas.
Some of them have a lot to offer: He is planning accelerated processes for deportation and more opportunities to arrest individuals prior to their deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought to the country should allow their smartphones to be checked, and present their social media accounts for security checks.
He wants to reduce tolerance for people who have been refused asylum - such as those who commit crimes, or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity.
Some of it is politically and legally tricky.
Some of it also seems half-baked, and leaves questions to be answered.
And for some points - such as the unequal treatment of tolerated persons - the following question is raised: What does that actually have to do with security and terrorism?
Yes, de Maizière says, it is important to differentiate between the issues posed by refugees, and the issue of terrorism.
But it cannot be denied that the perpetrators of the attacks in Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people are worried about security because of the large numbers of refugees.
And things that deeply worry people cannot be ignored - even during election season.
Domestic security has come to the fore to a huge extent.
First the attacks in neighbouring countries: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
There is a large amount of uncertainty.
And yes, elections are looming.
The Union and the SPD are consequently focusing more and more on the issue of security.
Over the past few days things have been quite heated between the two parties.
First a nasty argument about the Federal Police Force's equipment, then about an ideas-gathering event for security and politics-related discussions between some Ministers of the Interior in the Union, at which a burka ban and the renunciation of dual citizenship were demanded by department heads.
De Maizière is also trying to strike a conciliatory note here.
He does not think that dual citizenship will be removed.
We have dealt with the discussions in Germany.
It would not make sense to reopen discussions on this topic.
And he thinks that a burka ban would come up against constitutional issues.
However, it remains to be seen whether his own package is in line with the constitution throughout, and whether it really is "achievable" for his coalition partner.
There are few things inside it that could cause problems.
But the SPD is also currently attempting to use the issue of domestic security to shape itself.
SPD Head Sigmar Gabriel showed that the party was happy to discuss the issue, albeit sensitively at first, saying that "the SPD is prepared to discuss anything that will increase security further."
