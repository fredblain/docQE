Berlin/Schwerin: Poll ahead of regional elections: SPD and CDU lose out
Ahead of the elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), considerable losses are looming for the governing parties of the SPD and the CDU.
These are the findings of a representative poll carried out by INSA, a polling institute, on behalf of "Bild" newspaper.
While the red-black ruling coalition in the north might just be able to continue in office, this will not be possible in Berlin, according to the poll.
However, the SPD was the strongest party in both states, with good chances of putting forward the head of the government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD plummeted from 35.6 percent to 24 percent in five years.
According to the poll, this puts the party only slightly above the CDU, who had 23 percent.
The Left and the AfD will fight over third place.
The Left had 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), and, with 19 percent, the AfD could be in the regional parliament for the first time.
Despite small losses (from 8.7 percent to 6 percent), the Greens will return to Schwerin's regional parliament.
The NPD and the FPD, with 3 percent each, will not be represented in the regional parliament.
According to the poll, the SPD would only receive 23 percent in Berlin's elections to the House of Representatives (2011 elections: 28.3 percent).
The CDU would only take 18 percent, after having taken 23.4 percent.
This would put them behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left, with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House for the first time, with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FPD could hope to return, but the Pirates, by contrast, would miss out - unlike in 2011.
