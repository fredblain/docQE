Olympics: Tennis pro Siegemund misses out on the semi-final
Laura Siegemund's reign of success comes to an end in the Rio quarter-final: Ranked 32 in the world, the player from Metzingen will definitely miss out on the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament after losing 1:6, 1:6 against Monic Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA no.
34).
Sigemund, who has been struggling with back problems, was only able to hold her serve once, and seemed powerless in comparison to earlier rounds.
On Thursday, potential medallist Angelique Kerber (Kiel/no. 2) had the chance of making the semi-final.
The winner of the Australian Open faced off against Brit Johanna Konta (no. 10).
The last German tennis player to win was Tommy Haas, who took the silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
The last time there were two German tennis players in the quarter-finals of the summer games was in 1992.
There has never been a German-German Olympic semi-final.
