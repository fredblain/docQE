Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction
A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.
The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation
Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.
This family are notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.
Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished
Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past
Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.
The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.
One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.
The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.
The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.
I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.
She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
