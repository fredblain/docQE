From 1 October 2016, fees per cubic metre of sewage for the area covered by the sewage plant at Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl will be 3.44 euros instead of 2.10 euros as previously, 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp, and 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros) for Azendorf.
The sewage fee for the sewage works in Azendorf will be raised again if it is necessary to carry out improvement works.
According to an estimated calculation, sewage fees in Azendorf will then come to 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the district administration of Kulmbach approved the budget, it was determined that these sewage plants were underfunded.
The market town of Kasendorf is legally obliged to run the sewage works so that they break even.
From 1 October 2016, individuals and commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig a little deeper.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As administrative director Herbert Schmidt showed the committee, it was necessary to recalculate the fees for the sewage plants serving the market town.
Between October 2016 and September 2020, overfunding and underfunding from the previous calculation period will be balanced out.
Schmidt justifies the major fee increases by saying that all three sewage plants are relatively small and deal with a very small amount of waste, namely between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres a pear.
As a result of the low distribution, expenses for critical repairs amounting to several thousand euros, for example, seem major.
In addition, the amount of sewage arriving at all three plants is gradually decreasing.
Furthermore, the previous calculation period did not include renovation and repair works to a great extent for all three treatment plants, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants in Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the waste treatment plant at Azendorf needed to have its mechanical ventilation system replaced because of damage.
The conveyor system in the pumping station at Welschenkahl is almost 20 years old, and needs to be completely overhauled; the first clarification pond in the pond treatment plant at Lopp has been operational for almost 20 years and now needs to be dredged, its sewage sludge removed, and an additional ventilation system incorporated to ensure that it will be in line with water law regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were also coupled with perpetual support and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same is true for electricity costs: in the previous calculations for 2011/2012, they are far below their current levels.
Steinhäuser pointed out that, even with a low amount of sewage coming to the three plants, the expenses for running and maintaining them "were significantly impacted".
As a result, Schmidt expanded, the market town had been saved from large maintenance costs for the sewage treatment plants over the past 20 years.
From Steinhäuser's perspective, the plants mentioned will remain in a precarious situation in the long run, especially as the area covered by Friesenbachtal wastewater association cannot be expanded to include these plants because they are running at a deficit.
