Better flow of traffic on the motorway slip road
Traffic jams are a regular occurrence on the bypass - here's a photo from November.
But that is about to change: the right-hand turning lane is to be extended.
This is good news for all drivers stuck in rush-hour traffic on the bypass every evening as they drive onto the motorway slip road (A43).
Next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August), the State Roadworks Office will extendthe right-hand turning lane in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit from Weseler Straße by 700 metres.
This means that drivers will be able to feed in directly from Hammer Straße.
The major advantage is that traffic will split earlier, improving overall circulation on the busy section of main road 51.
The CDU fraction in the Münster (West) district administration came up with the idea to lengthen the exit.
The traffic on the slip road is particularly bad for drivers between 5pm and 7pm.
On weekdays, the traffic jam stretches to the bridge over Albersloher Weg - and sometimes even goes over it.
This is caused by the bottleneck on the B51, just before the exit onto Weseler Straße.
From here, there is only a single lane of traffic over the motorway bridge.
The second lane was removed a good eighteen months ago.
The reason for this was that structural analysis had shown that the bridge was no longer capable of supporting the weight caused by two lanes, particularly the weight of heavy goods vehicles.
The relevant authorities cannot say how long this bottleneck, and the associated rush-hour traffic, will last.
It's going to be a matter of years: officially, the bridge will remain in use until 2034.
The district authorities deliberately chose the less busy period of the school holidays for the extension of the right-hand turning lane, because it will cause delays.
Traffic will be diverted past the construction site in a single lane on Tuesday and Wednesday.
