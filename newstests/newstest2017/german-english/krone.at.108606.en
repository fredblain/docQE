Bomb terror in Thailand - One Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Thomas Schnöll, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said early on Friday morning.
She has some cuts, he says, and was treated in hospital, but has already been able to leave hospital.
She plans to return home at the start of September.
It is currently unclear whether other Austrian citizens have been affected by the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket or in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumpon.
According to Schnöll, the Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with local authorities as a result.
Hua Hin, located around 200 kilometres south of the capital city, Bangkok, two bombs went off in the nightlife district on Thursday evening.
According to police reports, a Thai woman was killed and around 20 people injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three people from Holland and three Italians.
There were another two explosions early on Friday morning, with another person killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported in Phuket early in the morning.
Police reports state that a taxi driver was injured in the explosion, which occurred near Patong beach, popular with holidaymakers.
Another bomb exploded in Surat Thani on the country's south-east coast, which led to the death of a civil servant.
According to the authorities, the explosive device was launched from a flower bed on the edge of the coastal police's territory.
Finally, explosions in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast caused several casualties.
There is apparently a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bomb attacks bear the same signature," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee to journalists early on Friday morning.
"We are assuming that the attacks were coordinated".
It is too early to speculate on possible motives, he says - however, it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that was typical of Islamic separatists in the south of the country.
However, the Thai police issued a statement that the attacks were not connected with the Islamist resistance movement or with global terrorism.
"It is just local sabotage, limited to particular areas and provinces," said a spokesperson in Bangkok.
It is more reasonable to assume that the bombs were set off by opponents of the military junta currently ruling the country.
Over the past few days, the authorities have received notification from the security services about attacks planned in the south of the country - but they do not know when and where exactly the attacks are planned for.
It is still apparently unclear who is behind the attacks.
The police told civil servants across the entire country to increase security around important governmental buildings, along with airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and nightlife districts.
Small-scale bombings are a frequent occurrence in Thailand, but they are rarely directed at tourists.
There is a palace in Hua Hin that was used by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej for years.
After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry has issued a recommendation on its homepage that Austrians follow the instructions from the Thai security agencies at all times.
The provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, along with Preah Vihear and its surroundings, have been issued with a high security alert (security level 3).
After skirmishes between security forces and Muslim sectors of the population, people are advised against all but essential travel to these districts.
The rest of the country is on an increased security alert (security level 2).
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came just a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This will give the military large-scale influence even in the years to come.
The Head of the junta, and Prime Minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos when the country was heading towards stability, an improved economic climate and tourism.
The military junta took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, and believes that it has led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to quell the latent resistance brewing with Muslim rebels in the southern edges of the country.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict so far.
A little under a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bankok - the majority of whom were foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack in the country's recent history.
