Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet sensation
Olympic athletes or world records aren't always the only things to hit the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by Robel Kiros Habte's brave performance at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Centre, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that, sometimes, it was impossible to see him in the televised images.
He just disappeared - no matter how wide a perspective was used.
Habte finally become a viral internet sensation on social networks.
The 24-year-old completed his heat 48 seconds slower than the next-fastest competitor, taking place 59 out of 59.
However, it was his not-quite sporty figure that caught the eye of the international media.
Why was the 24-year-old taking part in the Olympic games?
The Ethiopian was given special permission to take part by the international swimming federation.
This is given out to popularise swimming in underrepresented countries.
Because most athletes from Ethiopia run, Habte wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte prepared himself for the big race.
The first nicknames were soon doing the rounds.
Some media outlets dubbed him "Robel the whale".
With reference to his "flabby stomach", the British tabloid "The Sun" mocked his "Dad Bod".
His time, almost one minute and five seconds for the 100 metre freestyle, played no part in this.
Comparisons were also made with "Eric the Eel".
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's race also drew media attention.
The performance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable: he had to swim his 100 metre freestyle heat all on his own.
Moussambani was then greeted by wild cheering.
He was 22 years old at the time, and had learnt to swim eight months before the Olympics - and had never managed such a long distance before the competition began.
