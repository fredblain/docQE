GfK managing director steps down after disappointing figures
Consumer research firm GfK is replacing its managing director Matthias Hartmann.
His resignation came swiftly - but it was not a complete surprise.
The tricky situation in which market research firm GfK finds itself made it self-evident that Managing Director Matthias Harmann's seat became more and more unstable the longer the success he promised failed to materialise.
Turbulence at the top of Nuremberg's market research firm GfK: After another round of disappointing figures and the resignation of the managing director, the firm, fifth in its sector globally, is on the brink of a personal new start.
GfK's managing director wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The managing director of GfK's supervisory board, Arno Mahlert, has already announced that he will be leaving the supervisory committee with effect from 12 September.
The company announced that Gerhard Hausruckinger, who is currently a member of the board of directors, will take over the management of the board on 1 September.
Officially, he will take on the role of "board spokesman" until Hartmann's successor has been found.
The company cited "different viewpoints" on long-term business direction as the reason behind the resignation.
A company spokesman did not give further details on Friday.
It is currently not clear who will head up the market research firm in the future.
In investment circles, on Friday it was said that shareholders were greatly disappointed by the lack of success following the restructuring programme implemented years ago.
Mr Hartman has headed up GfK since 2011.
"The benefits of the restructuring programme will only become visible after 5 years," he said.
As a result of GfK's recent poor figures, every shareholder would be a little unsettled, he said.
"If that were the case at BMW, the quants would be too," he said.
After suffering losses in the previous quarters, the company was unable to stop losing money in the second quarter of 2016.
At 361.2 million euros, turnover was 6.1 lower than it had been in the same quarter of the previous year.
Compared to the first six months of the year, turnover (721.2 million euros) had shrunk by 3.4 percent.
The company's reduced value because of the difficult economic climate had impacted second-quarter profits, in particular.
The goodwill amortisation of 139 million euros required for the consumer experience sector was provided by the company, leading to a final loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had made a profit of 19.7 million.
