Steel - There's a ray of hope for the German steel industry
The German steel industry has been riddled with crises and uses a lot of energy - but it has been spared additional costs that could have run into the millions.
The sector had been threatened by financial burdens for the promotion of green energy, but these are now off the table.
Federal Minister of the Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ) newspaper on Friday that the exemption from the renewable energies levy would remain in place for electricity self-supply for pre-existing plants within the German steel industry.
"I am truly delighted by the fact that we have finally reached an agreement after two years of intense negotiations."
The European Commission had originally planned to make steel manufacturers, who use the gases from their blast furnaces to generate electricity for their own use, pay a levy.
According to the German association for the sector, the steel industry was threatened with additional costs ranging from 120 to 240 million euros a year.
Gabriel told WAZ that a basic agreement had now been reached with the EU Commission, following discussions with Margrethe Vestager, the Commissioner for Competition.
The EEG levy of 20 percent is now only due when the generators in the steelworks are replaced.
This too will not be levied against the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed the agreement Germany had reached with the EU Commission on electricity self-generation.
The agreement sees the status quo of the previous ruling largely formalised.
Gabriel's positive efforts are particularly important for the steel industry.
"It is the first step within our "steel is the future" campaign."
"This needs to be followed by other steps."
"Climate targets and employment objectives also need to be taken into account during negotiations to reform emissions allowances," explained IG Metall's CEO, JÃ¶rg Hofmann, in Frankfurt.
Since the financial crisis of 2008, Europe's steel sector has suffered from overcapacities and considerable pressure in terms of pricing.
The situation only worsened over the past year when the world' biggest producer, China, dumped steel into the global market en masse as a result of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel firms of price dumping.
The situation improved slightly during spring of this year.
On the one hand, import taxes started to have an impact on imported steel, on the other, economic prospects in China brightened up.
It is not clear how long prices will remain perked up for.
The German sector leader, Thyssenkrupp, was cautious on Thursday.
Prices had plateaued recently, he said.
The sector is reacting to the tricky situation by reducing prices further.
Thyssenkrupp also did not want to rule out closing individual plants.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in Germany's steel industry.
Despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remained cautious in July.
At 3.4 million tons, they produced a good six percent less raw steel than in the corresponding month in the previous year, as the steel association reported on Friday.
After a brief spike in May, the amounts produced shrunk for a second consecutive month.
Since the start of the year, production has been two percent less than the value for the equivalent period in the previous year.
The association is expecting output to increase over the next few months thanks to an improved situation in terms of orders.
