A controversial baseball star steps down
Alex Rodriguez' tears ran quicker than the US baseball star had run from base to base, in better days.
After his emotional announcement of retirement, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees jersey for the last time on 12 August, against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I'm saying goodbye to both of them," the 14-time All Star Major League Baseball (MLB) player explained.
Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
He signed a ten-year contract, which has brought him 27 million US dollars every year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will work as a consultant and a youth coach - on full pay.
Rodriguez paid this back in terms of playing performance long ago.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his team ("runs"), for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005, the Yankees, he has reached rather a few milestones.
Along with Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, there are only two other baseball players who can boast similar key statistics.
However, the 41-year-old cannot be welcomed into the baseball Hall of Fame.
Because no matter how successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the pitch, his behaviour off the pitch was just as controversial.
As far back as 2009 the superstar told ESPN that he had taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013 he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014 for his involvement in the "biogenesis scandal".
Rodriguez was the main suspect accused of having received performance enhancing drugs via an anti-ageing clinic in Florida over a period of years.
After a legal battle, the ban was reduced to 162 matches.
"The league might even have done me a favour in 2014 - I'd played for 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said, summing things up.
Even his final days didn't go off without a bang.
While many baseball legends take to the great stage over their last few games, Rodriguez had to sit on the sidelines.
"My job isn't about a retirement tour."
"My job is about trying to win every game," stated Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
Nevertheless, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and who has been rumoured to have been linked to pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, had the support of the fans of Yankees' arch rivals, Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the fans sang as they were defeated 4:9 by Rodriguez' team.
