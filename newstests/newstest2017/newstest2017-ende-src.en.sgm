<seg id="2">A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."</seg>
<seg id="4">The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."</seg>
<seg id="11">"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.</seg>
<seg id="12">Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was a kind spirit with a big heart.</seg>
<seg id="14">His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was the brother that went with the flow.</seg>
<seg id="17">"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone with information is asked to call the SFPD Tip Line at 415-575-4444.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jennifer Aniston need not always be perfect or successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is what the Hollywood star has made abundantly clear in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I'm always pigeonholed, or labelled by someone who has little, if anything, to do with me and reality."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Personally, I have no desire to be perfect and successful all the time."</seg>
<seg id="6">"To be honest, I don't really give a damn about things like that."</seg>
<seg id="7">Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she has been dubbed "Miss Perfect" in the current issue of "Cosmopolitan".</seg>
<seg id="8">The actress prefers to spend her time at home in front of the television with her hair in a relaxed bun, eating Mexican food, the magazine reports.</seg>
<seg id="9">The question of whether she wants children makes her livid: "We women do not need to be married or have children to feel fulfilled," the Hollywood star says.</seg>
<seg id="10">In her new film, "Mother's Day - love isn't child's play", Aniston stars as a single mother with two sons.</seg>
<seg id="11">The film is released in Germany on 25 August.</seg>

<seg id="1">Golfer Langer is awarded the Sport Pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experience on horseback is negligible.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golfing tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and a colleague went for a ride along the beach for a bit of fun.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a first for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horse decided it wanted to go home, and raced back to its feeding trough at full tilt.</seg>
<seg id="7">After a kilometre at this speed I was scared.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It wasn't a good experience," said Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And with that, his riding career came to an end again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - with 101 tournament wins under his belt - was once again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He and his family toured the ALRV grounds, but he did not jump onto a horse for a photo.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was Langer's first time in Aachen, and at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">He had been thoroughly convinced.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sport Aid foundation awarded the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sport Pyramid at a small gala event.</seg>
<seg id="15">The friendly sportsman is not lacking for awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Federal Cross of Merit, the Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has bestowed an honour upon him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Langer is the 18th person to be awarded the Sport Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Saturday, he met the first person to receive it, Hans Günter Winkler, in Aachen.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This award means a lot to me," said Langer, "because it's not just given for sporting success, but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been encouraging up-and-coming talent for years.</seg>
<seg id="22">And in this vein, he passed the prize money of 25,000 euros on straight away.</seg>
<seg id="23">The two-time US master's champion was inaugurated into the "Hall of Fame for German Sport" on Saturday, along with 15 other outstanding sportspeople.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those given the award include track athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, gymnast Eberhard Gienger, fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Putsch and Arnd Schmitt, rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, bob-sleigh rider Meinhard Nehmer, judo player Frank Wieneke, show-jumper Alwin Schockemöhle, and, posthumously, handball player Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious gathering wandered to the show-jumping stadium, where the Lavazza Prize was underway.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the large animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Comparing Clinton's and Trump's economic policies: It's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Both Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the two candidates for the US presidency disagree on taxes and energy policies, as well as on one fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is a fundamental philosophical reason for the differences between Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's economic policies.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">If in doubt, Trump wants the state's role to be minor, and warns of how the state can damage the economy with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to lead the economy to its death and regulate it to its death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He would do things totally differently, Trump says.</seg>
<seg id="9">He would repeal regulations, and lead a wide-reaching tax reform with low rates for private individuals and companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Conversely, Clinton says that the state has particular tasks to fulfil, giving disadvantaged people opportunities - and it needs money to do so.</seg>
<seg id="11">This would increase taxes for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, they have similar views on infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">There has to be investment in infrastructure, Trump and Clinton say almost verbatim.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State programs investing in infrastructure are classic Democrat policies, and are rejected by the tea party wing of the Republican party, which is critical of the state.</seg>
<seg id="16">Consequently, Trump could lead to discussions within the party.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are clearer differences to be seen in terms of energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and bring coal production in the USA back up.</seg>
<seg id="19">Drilling for oil should be permitted in protected areas, and he wants to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, Clinton wants to use her investment program to extend renewable energies, saying: "One country will become the superpower of renewable energies, and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"It will either be China, Germany or America - and I want it to be us."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's not just infrastructure that sees the two candidates taking a rather similar stance - they agree in terms of international trade agreements as well.</seg>
<seg id="23">Neither want to sign TTP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, neither want to cut the USA off from international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then also be better paid, Clinton demands.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a pittance, she says.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is not quite clear what Trump wants to do on this score: Once he said that the minimum wage had to be raised, then he said it should stay the same.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the months to come will likely revolve around both parties' tax policies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trump is on one side, wanting to relieve the burden on the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics state that this will just increase the budgetary deficit.</seg>
<seg id="32">Clinton is on the opposite side: as a minimum, she wants the rich to pay more taxes, and her critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Seeking refuge: "Every refugee woman has dealt with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">For women fleeing a country on their own, sexual violence is almost part of daily life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.</seg>
<seg id="4">One house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every one of them has a baby with them, the oldest of which is one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One woman holds her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks around the room inquisitively, his eyes wide.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she realises she's being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the child.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene looks normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you start talking to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the field manager for Condrobs, a provider of social assistance within Bavaria. One of the issues she deals with is refugee women.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich, in one of the few decentralised accommodation centres in Bavaria for refugee women and their children who have made the journey alone.</seg>
<seg id="17">Condrobs opened the centre in January, in collaboration with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Help organisation.</seg>
<seg id="18">It recently had its official opening.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - around 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not even male visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a bodyguard on the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I'm not exaggerating when I say that every woman who arrives here has dealt with sexual violence on her way to find refuge," said Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Men flee because of war, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families pin their hopes on them and send them to Europe," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="24">When women flee, other reasons are in the foreground: "Many women sneak away secretly, because they see no other way out".</seg>
<seg id="25">In their home countries, they experienced sexual violence, forced marriage, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That propels them forward.</seg>
<seg id="27">And it continues even while they're on the run.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It is not a rare occurrence that traffickers request a sexual act in exchange for a bottle of water, for example," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the woman are alone, unprotected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you think that this stops as soon as they arrive in Germany, you'd be wrong, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even in Germany, lone women are often seen as inferior in refugee accommodation, and, in the worst cases, they are abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">As a result, around 90 percent of the women living in accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatised, she estimates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Some of the children were certainly not conceived with the woman's consent".</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used to it that they do not say anything, she says.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Or they can't bring themselves to talk about what they experienced because they are too ashamed".</seg>
<seg id="36">Because they often don't know how to get help, there needs to be more accommodation just for them, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for providing accommodation for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">When asked if they knew of projects like the one in Munich operating within the areas they covered, some answered with "no".</seg>
<seg id="39">In Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia regions, for example, there is no similar accommodation offered by the government.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia, women who come as lone refugees are not given separate accommodation, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson for the region.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower Franconia and Middle Franconia, floors, or individual houses, are set aside in some shared accommodation for lone women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria: there, there are two central accommodation centres exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">Even the European Parliament's Committee on "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" stresses that women must be provided with accommodation separate from that of the men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published on behalf of the Committee, it was stated that "it is very important that men and women are given separate accommodation."</seg>
<seg id="45">"If there is a lack of private space, or if men and women are provided with accommodation together, this can result in (perpetual) violence against women".</seg>
<seg id="46">Washing facilities, above all, should be separate, and easily accessible for women, according to the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">The extent to which women need this protection can be seen in the sheer number of people interested in the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Since word has got around that we exist, we have developed a long waiting list," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">It would be easy to open a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.</seg>
<seg id="12">He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.</seg>
<seg id="13">Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.</seg>
<seg id="8">I lost count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russian public opinion has also turned since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He's denied that emphatically.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could claim a victory of sorts.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is also an economic motive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has slumped by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.</seg>
<seg id="33">They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.</seg>
<seg id="38">Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="40">Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.</seg>
<seg id="42">Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.</seg>
<seg id="45">Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland</seg>
<seg id="2">The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="3">Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.</seg>
<seg id="6">During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.</seg>
<seg id="9">Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins</seg>
<seg id="3">Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I'm very emotional because my family are here as well</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm relieved and very humble.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.</seg>
<seg id="18">I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.</seg>
<seg id="20">He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has been a rollercoaster ride.</seg>
<seg id="24">Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.</seg>
<seg id="5">A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).</seg>
<seg id="10">On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiles convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a move that has mystified Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">No-one knows yet.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="30">But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.</seg>
<seg id="3">ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Thursday before his termination was announced.</seg>
<seg id="5">There were creative differences on the set and a disagreement.</seg>
<seg id="6">I regret that it occurred," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">Details on how Gibson's character will be written out of the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, is expected to come at a later date, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 54-year-old, who previously starred on the sitcom Dharma & Greg, had been on the show since its first season in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">I had hoped to see it through to the end, but that won't be possible now.</seg>
<seg id="11">I would just like to say thank you to the writers, producers, actors, our amazing crew, and, most importantly, the best fans that a show could ever hope to have.</seg>
<seg id="12">The show is slated to return for its twelfth season on 28 September.</seg>

<seg id="1">Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife</seg>
<seg id="2">The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.</seg>
<seg id="10">We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.</seg>
<seg id="14">On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Happily, it all went very well.</seg>

<seg id="2">Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat off Anglesey.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.</seg>
<seg id="4">The three men struggled to swim to safety while their boat continued under its own power.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We saw their boat circling close to them and imagined the worst," said Moelfre lifeboat helm Vince Jones.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Fortunately, by the time we had launched, the strong winds had blown it clear of them," he added.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a lifejacket.</seg>
<seg id="8">They were all taken on board the inshore lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Jones said: "The three men thrown in the water are lucky to be alive and completely uninjured.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boat's engine had an emergency kill cord but it had somehow come detached from the person driving the boat when it capsized.</seg>
<seg id="11">Someone was watching over these guys today.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is going to build Braunschweig's low-cost housing?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens think that investors should step up to the plate much more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 low-cost homes over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">At the next council meeting, the SPD is going to put forward an "action plan for homes".</seg>
<seg id="5">But it won't be smooth sailing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Firstly, there is the question of who is actually going to build the low-cost homes?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, no settlement has been reached on this point.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD group chairman, Christoph Bratmann, says: "We agree with the Greens: if you want to build on municipal land, you will have to designate 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">The low-cost homes could also be older homes that are renovated.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the main issue for the council, according to Bratmann: "How do we handle investors who want to build on private ground?"</seg>
<seg id="11">We want investors building on those spaces to keep at least 10 percent, but if possible, 20 percent, of homes as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal programme to promote the construction of homes, which will cost millions, and which still needs to be financed, will trigger concerns.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, according to Bratmann: "At the moment, there is no agreement between groups."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to put as few rules on investors as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left wants more stringent requirements to be imposed on investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite that, according to Bratman, the situation in terms of the housing market is also hotting up.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, the building authorities will be faced with additional tasks.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff will be needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear if we will get the specialist staff.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not quite complete: because the approximately 1260 new homes are to be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you balance out the loss of an additional 1300 low-cost homes (approximately), the grants for which will run out over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">This will come to 500 homes even by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, according to Nicole Palm, spokeswoman for planning policy, bonds that are about to mature should be purchased by the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, thought must be given to putting homes back into a price maintenance scenario.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the west of the city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is because deadlines expire at the end of the year in the west of the city.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 homes could then be moved into the managed price scheme for affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="29">The only problem is that their owners, housing companies, are against it.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would dramatically increase the amount of affordable housing in the west of the city, taking a step back from the target of "blending".</seg>
<seg id="31">No longer are socially disadvantaged people to be concentrated in a small number of districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens think there's still room for manoeuvre in the discussions.</seg>
<seg id="33">Group chairman Holger Herlitschke thinks that "the CDU will have to get into bed with us to reach a decent majority."</seg>
<seg id="34">However, they have focused on providing more building sites for detached homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But that does not mean that it will be impossible to reach a compromise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go a worthy hunt for health and happiness</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world turns.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children do not get outside to play any more, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been the lament of many for the the past decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is getting people off the couch and into some activity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Screen time was initially limited to the television then video games and more recently smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it is great to see that technology and being active outdoors are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters first created for video games in the 1990s (it later spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop cultural phenomena it had gone off the boil somewhat before this new game was made available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The launch in other countries was then delayed by the massive response, which overloaded servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">So how does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In a nutshell, players on smartphones go out looking for Pokémons, which are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'captured'.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when younger have joined the craze, jumping off the couch for the search.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days of the game launching, the number of people it tracked who did 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it just sees raw data on exercise levels.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health campaigns to get people to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active everyday" have fallen on deaf ears because most public health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yet the importance of exercise cannot be understated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the beauty of Pokémon Go is it gets people outside doing something they enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus you are covering three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people are even making new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual there are po-faced killjoys looking for something to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes somebody might walk into a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">So what?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could previously track our activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise like this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The novelty will wear off and use will subside in due course.</seg>
<seg id="30">However because of Pokmeon's success there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics</seg>
<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all of it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on vault.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jaw-dropping on floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant all over.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now, finally, an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.</seg>
<seg id="21">While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.</seg>
<seg id="22">A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.</seg>
<seg id="26">Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.</seg>
<seg id="27">Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.</seg>
<seg id="28">She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.</seg>
<seg id="32">She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:</seg>

<seg id="1">Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car</seg>
<seg id="2">Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The gunman fired as many as eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car then fled in another vehicle, the report states.</seg>
<seg id="5">Police say the triple killing doesn't appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker didn't take purses or $2,900 in the possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was tied to four earlier attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In all, seven people have been killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods over a four-month period.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's occurring within a residential area in front of a home," Howard said to CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="9">The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including as a late-1990s brown Nissan, a late-1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators have declined to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are related and committed by the same killer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told police that it wasn't unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">Authorities also released a police report on a shooting that targeted an unoccupied pickup truck just a half-hour before the triple killing and is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found bullet casings and recovered a bullet from a seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="2">Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.</seg>
<seg id="3">But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mom Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know about while pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="4">When he first came home my initial thought was, I can't do this.</seg>
<seg id="5">I can't do this.</seg>
<seg id="6">I didn't sign up for this.</seg>
<seg id="7">Which is not true at all -- of course you sign up for it," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">She and her husband, Vincent, were told Edmund might never recognize them, and that he might not even survive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some doctors went as far as suggesting he be institutionalized.</seg>
<seg id="10">"My first response was 'I didn't think people did that anymore,'" Picciuto explained.</seg>
<seg id="11">Edmund walks with the help of a walker.</seg>
<seg id="12">Edmund didn't sit up or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he's slowly meeting some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="14">He's walking with help, and riding a bike.</seg>
<seg id="15">He also loves playing with his two brothers, and singing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language Edmund made up for "please sing to me."</seg>
<seg id="17">"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it's not just typical sign language -- she says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic ones like Edmund's, and infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and Zika.</seg>
<seg id="20">Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.</seg>
<seg id="22">Picciuto remembers the emotional toll of an uncertain future.</seg>
<seg id="23">I kept saying, what's going to happen?</seg>
<seg id="24">What's going to happen?</seg>
<seg id="25">And she still doesn't really know.</seg>
<seg id="26">I actually haven't asked for a prognosis in forever, because I don't expect anyone to really be able to tell me.</seg>
<seg id="27">But Picciuto has hopeful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects from Zika.</seg>
<seg id="28">It gets better.</seg>
<seg id="29">You know it will get better for you.</seg>
<seg id="30">You will love your child, and your child will love you.</seg>

<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi were overflowing their banks and threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local officials, and assistance is already on the move to affected parishes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were coming in for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood watch remains in effect until Saturday across most of south Louisiana.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall over the area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In south Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Comite River near Baton Rouge and Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set record crests over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">Forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that flooding downstream in Ascension Parish is a threat, as those swollen rivers will be slow to drain into Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescuers were still plucking people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says waters from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose quickly overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We woke up and the water kept on coming," Hansford said.</seg>
<seg id="19">It came up to my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that it's the highest she's seen the creek in the 48 years she's lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members all have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three in a large military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they were sheltering Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann says flooding is "quickly becoming widespread" as heavy rains continue, saying officials are considering evacuation orders.</seg>
<seg id="24">Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said the ground was heavily saturated by rainfall since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Heavy rain and street flooding prompted the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="27">CBS affiliate WWL reports that an alderwoman in Tangipahoa said 200 homes flooded.</seg>
<seg id="28">Residents had been evacuated to two churches but both are now flooding.</seg>
<seg id="29">Parish President Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by high water.</seg>
<seg id="30">Shelters have been opened in the town of Amite and the city of Hammond to house those who were evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"They will be allowed to return home once the water starts to recede," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the Tangipahoa Parish city of Hammond, close to two dozen streets were closed because of high water, and sandbags were made available for pickup by residents hoping to keep water out of homes and businesses.</seg>
<seg id="33">"The last major flood we had was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.</seg>
<seg id="34">This one is on track to be a similar event.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">He said a handful of houses were reported as flooded Thursday, but none have been reported so far Friday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I've seen water in some places I have never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming down."</seg>

<seg id="1">Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting</seg>
<seg id="2">Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.</seg>
<seg id="6">I just can't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="7">The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.</seg>
<seg id="8">Family tells the station he is expected to recover.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.</seg>
<seg id="14">The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.</seg>
<seg id="16">Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.</seg>
<seg id="17">It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.</seg>
<seg id="18">There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.</seg>
<seg id="19">So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.</seg>
<seg id="20">Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.</seg>
<seg id="21">No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="23">She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team looks, finally, like America.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is powerful.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.</seg>
<seg id="14">And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.</seg>
<seg id="19">Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."</seg>
<seg id="6">With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="1">The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat</seg>
<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.</seg>

<seg id="1">PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish</seg>
<seg id="2">Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are</seg>
<seg id="20">His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.</seg>
<seg id="27">Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.</seg>

<seg id="3">But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.</seg>
<seg id="4">So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid</seg>
<seg id="6">Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.</seg>
<seg id="7">U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.</seg>
<seg id="9">'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.</seg>
<seg id="10">'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.</seg>
<seg id="13">And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.</seg>
<seg id="14">Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor</seg>
<seg id="15">Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.</seg>
<seg id="16">Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'</seg>

<seg id="18">Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest</seg>
<seg id="19">Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks</seg>
<seg id="20">One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'</seg>
<seg id="21">Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.</seg>

<seg id="2">Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday</seg>
<seg id="3">Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.</seg>
<seg id="4">Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.</seg>
<seg id="5">MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thanks for that.</seg>
<seg id="8">Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.</seg>
<seg id="9">Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used</seg>
<seg id="10">Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????</seg>
<seg id="11">The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'</seg>
<seg id="12">Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'</seg>
<seg id="13">Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out</seg>
<seg id="14">Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being</seg>
<seg id="15">Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.</seg>
<seg id="16">You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.</seg>
<seg id="17">Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'</seg>
<seg id="18">It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'</seg>
<seg id="19">CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark</seg>
<seg id="20">Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf</seg>
<seg id="21">CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments</seg>
<seg id="22">The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.</seg>
<seg id="23">We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.</seg>
<seg id="24">We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.</seg>
<seg id="25">To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.</seg>
<seg id="26">That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.</seg>
<seg id="28">'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'</seg>
<seg id="29">'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'</seg>
<seg id="30">'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'</seg>

<seg id="2">Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.</seg>
<seg id="3">To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.</seg>
<seg id="4">She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf</seg>
<seg id="6">A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'</seg>
<seg id="7">She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'</seg>
<seg id="8">Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.</seg>
<seg id="9">'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'</seg>
<seg id="10">'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'</seg>
<seg id="11">She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.</seg>
<seg id="12">'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'</seg>
<seg id="16">'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'</seg>
<seg id="17">A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'</seg>
<seg id="18">All the product in question has been removed from sale.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga</seg>
<seg id="2">It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.</seg>
<seg id="5">If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.</seg>
<seg id="6">You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds tricky?</seg>
<seg id="11">Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.</seg>
<seg id="12">But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright scrapes his tongue along Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test - by licking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his tongue along a Euro note, a Piccadilly Circus hand rail, a train toilet's flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself, and us, just what he was getting in to.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which has be made into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, threw up some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of licking a train's flush button used by thousands of other may be utterly repellent, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">All the way along his trip through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about boosting gut bacteria and about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything more than a bad taste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright became known for testing the durability of his gut by travelling around the world and eating weird and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public handrails in train stations to a toilet flush button the task definitely tested his immune system</seg>
<seg id="11">In the movie made about it he said: 'Ever since I was a kid I have been fairly carefree with my health and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth from soil, eating worms and muddy water.'</seg>
<seg id="12">He certainly proved his reputation during the film.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he turned down was a filthy Russian public toilet.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample swab showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">By comparison, freshly washed hands should come in under 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer count was over 4000 units, when freshly washed hands are less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have produced the traveller's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength which shows the bacteria count in different place like in the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">He said in the film: 'That is close to one of the worst things I have smelled in a toilet.'</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in there.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in conjunction with Finnish dairy producer Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contain lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost people's gut bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valio's Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juice and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did a lot of crazy brainstorming that ended in the idea "let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I asked him to, like the disgusting Russian toilet that's shown in the film.'</seg>
<seg id="31">Naturally some things were easier to get Ian to lick, some were pretty tough.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks caught on tape.'</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and gut and 58 per cent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="1">Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction</seg>
<seg id="2">A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">This family are notorious and their name is notorious.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished</seg>
<seg id="14">Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="21">'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'</seg>
<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction</seg>
<seg id="33">Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tourists sun worshipping in Aveiro, Portugal, had the shock of their lives</seg>
<seg id="3">A Portuguese air force P-3C Orion plane swooped in incredibly low</seg>
<seg id="4">The air force said it was on a training flight but insisted no risk to safety</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying jet swooped down over a packed beach.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dramatic footage showed the military plane almost coming within touching distance of sunseekers on the stretch of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Holidaymakers rose to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the jet engines without being able to see at first what was coming their way through the clouds.</seg>
<seg id="8">The incident happened in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-by onto social media, said: 'It passed really low twice and there was a point when it looked like it was going to crash.'</seg>
<seg id="10">Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and swear it felt like the plane was going to fall on top of me.'</seg>
<seg id="11">Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the murk and flew at an incredibly low altitude</seg>
<seg id="12">The Portuguese Air Force said today the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to drop so low because it was the only way of checking them.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said the jet had flown slightly lower than normal because of poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force insisted no-one's safety had been compromised.</seg>
<seg id="14">Wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer as well as killing four people on the island of Madeira.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Portuguese air force said today the pilot had to fly low because of the conditions - thick fog and smoke from wildfires - which obscured his visibility</seg>
<seg id="16">The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was being asked to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise</seg>

<seg id="2">Seville - On Sunday, FC Barcelona will fight to take their first step towards their first title of the new football season.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Catalan team will face off against FC Sevilla in an away game in Spain's Supercup; the second leg will take place three days later in Camp Nou.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two-time champions will have to face up to the defeated Cup finalists and reigning Europa League champions without Neymar, who is playing in the Olympic football tournament for Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="5">In addition, goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.</seg>
<seg id="6">During training the German pulled a ligament in his knee. At least it's clear who'll be wearing the number one jersey for Barca: Claudio Bravo.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Chilean international and Ter Steigen have been competing for number one status for two years now.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coach Luis Enrique has so far refused to make a clear decision either way, allowing Bravo to wear the jersey in league games, but giving it to Ter Stegen in most of their other matches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ahead of the first compulsory game of the new season there were doubts as to the Spanish champions' fitness: they lost 0-4 to Liverpool in a friendly game on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even with 3-2 in a friendly against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and co. were not really all that convincing.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, Sevilla have to swallow their 2-3 extra-time defeat against Real Madrid in the Supercup, and are aiming for a second victory in the "Supercopa de Espana".</seg>
<seg id="12">With eleven victories, Barcelona are the current record-holders for this competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ma Long is in a league of his own, taking Gold in the table tennis</seg>
<seg id="2">Rio de Janeiro - Ma Long, from China, is the new table tennis Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, the 27-year-old beat his fellow countryman and "defending champion" Zhang Jike in Rio de Janeiro 4-0 in a one-sided final (12,5,4,4).</seg>
<seg id="4">This gave the world number one the "golden grand slam", winning the World Championship, the World Cup, the final tournament of the World Tour, and the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bronze medal went to Jun Mizutani from Japan.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two Chinese men made it to the final, as expected, and fought each other for the title.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was clear that, for the third time in a row, a Chinese athlete would take the singles title at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="8">The last non-Chinese athlete on the top step of the Olympic podium was former SVS Lower Austria legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ma and Zhang were alone at the table: they had no coaches with them between sets and during time-outs.</seg>
<seg id="10">They had returned to the stands, leaving their charges alone to fight a fair battle against each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Up until now, I have played for my country."</seg>
<seg id="12">"In the final, I'm playing for myself," Zhang summarised.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the game, the gold and silver medallists posed with the Chinese flag.</seg>
<seg id="14">The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ma only had to fight off his 28-year-old opponent in the first set.</seg>
<seg id="16">Afterwards, he set the pace on the table, and only let Zhang score a total of 13 points.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ma's dominance meant that the match was not as exciting as expected.</seg>
<seg id="18">But nevertheless, there were some breathtaking volleys to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mizutani won the bronze medal match against 40-year-old Wladimir Samsonow 4-1.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Belarussian had injured his rib in his quarter-final against German European Champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, and was given medical treatment, and ultimately had to content himself with fourth place.</seg>

<seg id="2">The US Republicans' lead is plagued by significant fears that they might lose their majority, even in states that are traditionally conservative.</seg>
<seg id="3">Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted to the weaknesses of his election campaign in Utah, formerly a Republican stronghold.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a strange moment - the multi-millionaire normally puts on a pompous, self-assured performance, but this time he expressed something analogous to doubt, as correspondents report.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had beaten 16 rivals from within the Republican camp, doubt is now growing as to whether he will be successful in the race for the White House.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said to an audience of evangelical Christians whom he asked for assistance in key states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="7">He blamed false reports on his candidacy, once again giving the media a dressing-down, as he is known to do.</seg>
<seg id="8">Republican strongholds are wavering</seg>
<seg id="9">Utah is normally a safe seat for the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="10">A poll carried out by SurveyUSA in June puts Trump and his competitor on an equal footing with Democrat Hillary Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="11">Other bodies do put Trump ahead, but not by the margin usual for Republican candidates in the state.</seg>
<seg id="12">Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.</seg>
<seg id="13">In an interview with broadcaster CNBC, Trump was asked how he would stop Clinton's rise, replying: "In the same way I have done before".</seg>
<seg id="14">And he added: "Either it'll work out, or I'll go on a long, long holiday".</seg>
<seg id="15">He said he was just "telling the truth".</seg>
<seg id="16">If he doesn't make it because of political correctness, that's ok, Trump added.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then, he said, I'd return to a very nice way of life.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to press reports, the party have threatened Trump with removing financial support for his election campaign if he is unable to do any better in the polls.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead, the Republican congressional candidates would be offered more support.</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary committee to handle the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">Following the second doping scandal at the Rio Olympics, trouble is looming for Kenya's track and field athletes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an attempt to deceive a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent one coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee announced that it would set up a disciplinary committee immediately to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan official announced that former sprinter and current coach John Anzrah had given a urine sample in the Olympic village in the name of 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kenya's team managers were allegedly informed of this by the doping officials.</seg>
<seg id="8">The global IAAF federation has requested information about the matter from the IOC so it can carry out its own investigations, stated an IAAF spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The IAAF will perform an evaluation, depending on the findings of the investigation and the steps taken by the IOC as a result," said an IAAF statement.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He (Anzrah) went to the doping check and alleged that he was Ferguson Rotich, handed in the sample, and signed for it," explained Stephan Arap Soi, Kenya's Chef de Mission.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had the athlete's accreditation as given in the list of training checks for the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich came fourth in the 800-metre race at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days previously, the Head of the Kenyan track & field delegation, Michael Rotich, had been sent away from the Rio games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He was alleged to have told sportspeople from his country about upcoming doping tests in exchange for money.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was arrested on his return at Nairobi Airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">After numerous instances of doping, the IOC has been keeping a particularly close eye on Kenya for a while.</seg>
<seg id="17">When the IOC announced that it would hold more than 2000 targeted doping checks in advance of the Rio games, it also announced, unusually, that athletes from Kenya and Russia would be examined particularly closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ahead of the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to introduce an anti-doping law and a functioning system of checks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="20">Following this, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose anti-doping measures comply with WADA rules.</seg>
<seg id="21">Running is a national sport in Kenya.</seg>
<seg id="22">The country's track and field athletes won the most medals at the 2015 world championships in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of televised reports by ARD, the claim was made time and again that doping drugs are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a mentality of cheating at sport.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound has recently called for an investigation in Kenya to mirror that which took place into Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">This investigation proved that doping was undertaken extensively and systematically across the sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">As a result, Russia's track and field athletes were banned from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare anniversary year, the Salzburger Festspiele is putting on "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as tragic couple just like Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">Featuring a surprise: Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical has gripped Salzburg: Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece, "West Side Story".</seg>
<seg id="5">Artistic Director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music, and has made a childhood dream come true by taking on the role of Maria.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra will be conducted by Venezuelan director Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it has a lot of Latin American influences.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American elements in its tempo and melodies.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect formula for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers her love affair with Tony with wistfulness, while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Maria has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">Firstly because it's musically unusual!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there's Maria's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">As she says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".</seg>
<seg id="17">So she's clever, and naive of course, and full of passion.</seg>
<seg id="18">"She's very like me, like my Italian personality as a girl from Rome," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">We are so honoured to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">She is an incredibly generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and so passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">For him, conducting is a need.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in all his movements, his glances - it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a great chance to be able to share this musical experience with him.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, has reportedly died in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="3">Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">She was believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was making plans to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.</seg>
<seg id="6">"One would hope that the only benefit out of this is - as a tombstone and testament to others, that these are the risks actually involved in going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making that choice really," Akunjee said.</seg>
<seg id="7">In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a flight to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultana's family was told she married an ISIL fighter in Syria - and became a widow within months.</seg>

<seg id="2">Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.</seg>
<seg id="3">Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.</seg>
<seg id="7">He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.</seg>
<seg id="8">Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</seg>
<seg id="9">Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.</seg>

<seg id="1">Turkey: Kurdish community faces mass exodus</seg>
<seg id="2">"If you don't change your tune and praise Erdogan, your suitcase is basically packed," says the President of the Gülen-supporting Dialogue and World foundation, Ercan Karakoyun.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish community in Germany is expecting tens of thousands of people to arrive at short notice in search of protection, fleeing from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the medium term, this could even grow to "a few hundred thousand", believes Ali Toprak, President of the association.</seg>
<seg id="5">The crackdown instigated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup has led the Germany Kurdish Association to expect a mass exodus to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the short term I'm expecting ten thousand, in the medium term a few hundred thousand people coming from Turkey looking for protection in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to antagonise minorities and democratic opposition," said the President of the Association, Ali Toprak, to "Die Welt" newspaper on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">A few months ago the government initiated punitive action against Kurdish strongholds - and as a result, 500,000 Kurds are already on the run within Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the unsuccessful coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks have been added to the list.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to seek a new start in Europe if they continue to suffer oppression in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is unacceptable that a country that takes in refugees is also producing them," said Toprak.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the Association complained about the deliberate relocating of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish and Alevi towns.</seg>
<seg id="12">He thinks that Erdogan did this to encourage the remaining Kurds to leave.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They are the last big minority in Turkey: the Christian Armenians and the Greeks have already been exterminated or driven out over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="14">The head of the Association requested that the Federal Government acted "as harshly as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".</seg>
<seg id="15">A "witch-hunt" is also underway in Germany against those critical of Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the past few months, I have no longer felt safe in Germany for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears that many Turks will flee abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and members of the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="19">Being singled out as a Gülen-supporter is career-destroying for teachers and other academics.</seg>
<seg id="20">"If you don't change your tune and praise Erdogan, your suitcase is basically packed," said the President of the Gülen-supporting Dialogue and World Foundation, Ercan Karakoyun, to "Die Welt" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="21">As the newspaper reports, using figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, even before the coup Turks were the largest group granted asylum in Germany on the grounds of political persecution.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the reference date of June 30, this amounted to 11,386 people, almost 29 percent of all people entitled to asylum (39,625).</seg>
<seg id="23">These figures do not include people who have fled war, poverty or a lack of prospects.</seg>
<seg id="24">Under the constitution, only individuals suffering political persecution, i.e., on the part of the state, are entitled to asylum.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: Locals hear nothing about the summer elections - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood this.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the state parliament elections will not take place at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament decided at the start of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">The way things had been going was simply ridiculous: summer holidays, heat and state parliament elections - they clash with one another.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who need to be won over by the candidates are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most holidaymakers in the state, in Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals - and are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are also practical problems to consider: during the holidays, volunteers who put up signs, blow up balloons, distribute flyers and count the votes at the end, are hard to find.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, election day and the last day of the holidays, people in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must put up with one more election without the people being consulted.</seg>
<seg id="10">The heated phase, if that can be said at all, has already begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And there's something at stake: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, is fearing for his seat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU, according to polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">It will be exciting to see how Neuling AfD carves things up, and whether a coalition can be formed with what's left at the end.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of the parliament since 2008, pursued a rather inconspicuous election campaign, as can be seen from his posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He is travelling around the region, distributing roses and chatting a bit with people, just as his legendarily taciturn predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Apart from that, Seelering has got cold feet, blaming Chancellor Merkel for the rise of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her refugee policies, her "we can manage it" have accelerated the rise of the far-right, he believes - which will probably cost him his job.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU and its top-level candidate, Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what happens when you fight an election in the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">The CDU have invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to two mass rallies; Merkel's parliamentary constituency is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group wasn't right: there were more people from North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there than people from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The majority probably came from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, complained to the NDR recently.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it won't do any harm to anyone from other parts of Germany to listen to Angela Merkal for once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the north-east CDU is generally dispensing with the normal election events with parasols and balloons in market squares and outside shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Kokert, that will only play a "minor role".</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noticed that they are losing their footing in the region, and will have to work hard to connect with the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">They are suffering like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present across large swathes of the region.</seg>
<seg id="27">The advice that CDU candidate Kokert gave to his competitors is revealing: "You have got to go where it hurts, or where the people are: village fetes, Golden Wedding anniversaries, you have to make use of every birthday party."</seg>
<seg id="28">Sellering has already called his SPD to fight a particularly committed election campaign because there is so much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to polls, the social democrats have 22 percent, behind their partners the CDU (25), and only fractionally ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 elections, the SPD had a clear victory over the CDU (35.6 percent versus 22 percent).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the regional parliament.</seg>
<seg id="32">They are making a modern virtue out of the holiday issue, and are waging their election war predominantly online.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Online election campaign" is what the regional chairperson Claudia Müller has dubbed it.</seg>
<seg id="34">Apart from that, the Greens are searching out local voters among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, their top candidate, is currently crossing Mecklenburg's lakes on a houseboat - and is having a nice time.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her view? "Having an election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern isn't all that bad".</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 redevelopment: restaurants are suffering from the closure</seg>
<seg id="2">There are hardly any problems with the speed at which the B27 is being redeveloped.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is praise from all quarters for the people responsible for the construction works, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="4">"They have done everything so speedily," Elvira Texlaff at the Jet petrol station explains.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are also no delays.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the start of the week, the construction site could be moved southwards in line with plans, marking the half-way point, and everything is expected to be completed by October.</seg>
<seg id="8">The obligingness of the people responsible for the construction works in terms of setting up substitute driveways.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was moved southwards on Monday, and the Aspegstraße in Ofterdingen was reopened, and the link to Rottenburg was re-established, the traffic situation within the town has improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">Residents can now drive on both sides of the B 27 out of Ofterdingen.</seg>
<seg id="11">There seem to be fewer drivers taking alternative routes through the town.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There were some serious complaints made," said Florian King, deputy chief officer responsible for traffic management during the redevelopment.</seg>
<seg id="13">Residents in Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to put up with more traffic noise because people were looking for ways to cut through, trusting their satnav more than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">This led to some lorries hurtling through residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">The commune has increased calls for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen because speed limits were not always adhered to either.</seg>
<seg id="16">"There were considerable infringements," said King, who had taken a look on-site to see what was going on.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three vehicles were snapped by a speed camera every minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was travelling at 77 kilometres per hour in a 30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, things have quietened down.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is only a small consolation for businesses located along the B 27 that the road has reopened for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to show their hand.</seg>
<seg id="22">But nobody we questioned hid the fact that the B 27 redevelopment had led to a drop in profits.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some have been affected more than others.</seg>
<seg id="24">People who have little to do with "end customers", i.e. if they make products for other companies, have hardly been affected by the redevelopment.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even at the Maier car dealership, Thomas Sulz talked of "a slight loss, at the most", but also admitted that "there had been a lack of passing trade".</seg>
<seg id="26">Bars and restaurants along the road had been the hardest hit.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse (previously Krone), expressed himself clearly.</seg>
<seg id="28">It has threatened our very existence.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's not just him: all restaurants have been "hit hard".</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil stayed away.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro of profit we make.</seg>
<seg id="32">He reckons that profits slumped by "far more than 50 percent".</seg>
<seg id="33">The road redevelopment "set back" his businesses "by two years".</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to let half of his staff go.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and had to let half of them go, politicians would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, when Göhner asked the government's president, Jörg Schmidt, if there would be financial compensation, the president replied that the restaurant benefited already from its location on the B 27. And now it just had to deal with the disadvantages thrown up by the redevelopment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows of other districts where people have acted more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">Despite all the complains, Göhner is convinced that his restaurant will survive.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business moved there back in 1715, he said, referring to its long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that his regular customers visit less as a result of the complicated traffic system.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive past, other places are also nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his regulars will return once the redevelopment works have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner believes that the effects of the B 27 works on his clientele mark the biggest crisis his restaurant has suffered in its long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction works, that's brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Law are constantly being passed in the name of anti-terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the most recent attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now putting forward a host of security measures.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what does residential status have to do with terrorism?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner have to say about it all?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière is playing the conciliator.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, the Federal Minister of the Interior said when revealing his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are not asking too much of anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, more wide-reaching issues will first be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I will also be involved in that.</seg>
<seg id="10">As Minister of the Interior, however, he is responsible for results, and for reaching an "achievable agreement" within the coalition, he says.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the most recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière let a little time pass before announcing his conclusions for security within Germany.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, they are more comprehensive as a result.</seg>
<seg id="13">One thing was already known, announced, heralded: The fact that a new security agency is going to work on cracking encrypted communications is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Neither is the fact that Germany will have to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and gun laws.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies also does not come as a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="16">To some extent, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that the SPD long wanted nothing to do with: He wants to penalise advertising for terrorist groups, and remove German passports from jihadis with dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="17">"They will be difficult issues for the SPD," admitted the CDU politician.</seg>
<seg id="18">Despite this, he believes they are achievable, and is not demanding anything that has no chance with the coalition partner.</seg>
<seg id="19">De Maizière also presented a few new ideas.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them have a lot to offer: He is planning accelerated processes for deportation and more opportunities to arrest individuals prior to their deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are specifically brought to the country should allow their smartphones to be checked, and present their social media accounts for security checks.</seg>
<seg id="22">He wants to reduce tolerance for people who have been refused asylum - such as those who commit crimes, or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is politically and legally tricky.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of it also seems half-baked, and leaves questions to be answered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And for some points - such as the unequal treatment of tolerated persons - the following question is raised: What does that actually have to do with security and terrorism?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière says, it is important to differentiate between the issues posed by refugees, and the issue of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be denied that the perpetrators of the attacks in Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people are worried about security because of the large numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that deeply worry people cannot be ignored - even during election season.</seg>
<seg id="30">Domestic security has come to the fore to a huge extent.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the attacks in neighbouring countries: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">There is a large amount of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, elections are looming.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are consequently focusing more and more on the issue of security.</seg>
<seg id="36">Over the past few days things have been quite heated between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">First a nasty argument about the Federal Police Force's equipment, then about an ideas-gathering event for security and politics-related discussions between some Ministers of the Interior in the Union, at which a burka ban and the renunciation of dual citizenship were demanded by department heads.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also trying to strike a conciliatory note here.</seg>
<seg id="39">He does not think that dual citizenship will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have dealt with the discussions in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">It would not make sense to reopen discussions on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="42">And he thinks that a burka ban would come up against constitutional issues.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, it remains to be seen whether his own package is in line with the constitution throughout, and whether it really is "achievable" for his coalition partner.</seg>
<seg id="44">There are few things inside it that could cause problems.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also currently attempting to use the issue of domestic security to shape itself.</seg>
<seg id="46">SPD Head Sigmar Gabriel showed that the party was happy to discuss the issue, albeit sensitively at first, saying that "the SPD is prepared to discuss anything that will increase security further."</seg>

<seg id="1">Volkswagen gets off lightly.</seg>
<seg id="2">Despite the diesel scandal, global delivery figures are increasing.</seg>
<seg id="3">But things aren't quite as rosy in all markets.</seg>
<seg id="4">The recall has led to fuss about one term.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen's deliveries were more restrained in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thanks to its number of brands and some well-functioning markets, Europe's largest car manufacturer can boast another plus for the previous year, despite the diesel scandal.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, in July, the VW core brand suffered, particularly in Western Europe, thereby affecting overall sales, as the Dax-listed company announced.</seg>
<seg id="8">Globally, the VW brand sold 449,100 cars in July - 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same month in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent lower than in the same month the year before.</seg>
<seg id="10">In its home market of Germany, deliveries plummeted by almost a sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Head of brand sales, Jürge Stackmann, blamed July's poor figures on the loss of two sales days in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, some key markets saw "changed economic climates", which led to fewer purchases.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation regarding the attempted coup in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU had also had an impact, a spokeswoman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, where the emissions scandal first began, the books are once again in the red.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Chinese market is a source of great support for VW.</seg>
<seg id="16">In total, Lower Saxony's own brand, which was most affected, has got off lightly from the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, there is a minus in the books for deliveries amounting to 0.9 percent of 3.37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Head of sales at the company, Fred Kappler, was once again able to bring out an increase in sales from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles in this time period, coming to a global total of 5.904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had used software to manipulate emissions tests.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW has called 2.5 million vehicles back to workshops to be refitted.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of modifying the vehicles VW emphasised that refitting them would have no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the vehicles have been modified, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor performance would not get worse.</seg>
<seg id="23">After modification, the car manufacturer will provide its customers with a certificate that is "as good as a guarantee" but would not talk of an actual "guarantee", as was mentioned on Friday in corporate circles.</seg>
<seg id="24">Legal intricacies are the reason for this.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Focus" reported that Volkswagen would provide its German customers with a guarantee for modified diesel cars nonetheless.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport on the Monday previous.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW must fully meet the requirements of my investigative committee and the KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Deviations will not be accepted," explained Alexander Dobrindt (CDU), the Federal Minister for Transport, according to the Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW took on the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor performance would not get worse as a result of the modification, and all vehicle values relevant to type approval would remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as has been mentioned in corporate circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">Volkswagen believes that the broad term "guarantee" could see customers returning to the workshop with motor damage six months after the modification - and being able to blame this on the new software, even if the damage had nothing at all to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is also in the customers' interest to prevent confusion with guarantee clauses for any other faults that have nothing at all to do with the emissions scandal.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is why VW will not be using the term "guarantee".</seg>

<seg id="1">The Raffeisen Bank in Gmund am Tegernsee will demand penalty interest from wealthy savers in the future - and it will be the second bank in Germany to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2">Managing Director of the bank, Josef Paul, said on Thursday that "this only applies to 139 customers with 40 million euros in their current accounts or day-to-day accounts".</seg>
<seg id="3">The Federal Association of German Banks believes this is an isolated case, and does not see it as a sign: normal savers "need not worry about being hit with penalty interest on the pennies they've put aside".</seg>
<seg id="4">If banks invest money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay penalty interest of 0.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="5">From September, the Raffeisen Bank in Gmund will be asking private and business customers with more than 100,000 euros in their current account or day-to-day account to pay this fee.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The first 100,000 euros are free."</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the future, any subsequent 100,000 euros will cost 400 euros a year," Paul said.</seg>
<seg id="8">For some time, he has been managing 40 million euros that could be withdrawn any day, and that he is unable to make use of.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The money has been sitting in my account at the Central Bank, and costing 0.4 percent," the bank CEO said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I cannot put 4000 euros aside for every million."</seg>
<seg id="11">He is passing on the costs under the "polluter pays" principle.</seg>
<seg id="12">It would be far too dangerous just to leave the cash in the Raffeisen Bank's safe: "I have already been through four raids, I don't want a fifth!" the bank's managing director said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Most customers have been understanding, and have switched to other forms of investment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only a small number moved to other banks.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Federation of Cooperatives of Bavaria explained that "the extreme monetary policy pursued by the ECG leads to all banks incurring significant costs".</seg>
<seg id="16">It would be "impossible" for them to bear these costs "on a permanent basis, from a business perspective".</seg>
<seg id="17">As a result, some German banks have increased the fees they charge for account management, credit cards or transfers.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thuringia's "Volks- und Raffeisen Bank" in Altenburger Land hit the headlines in 2014 when their Skatbank branch imposed penalty interest on investments of more than three million euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">Michael Kemmer, managing director of the banking association, said: "We are not expecting that private customers will all have to pay fees for investments - the competition between banks in Germany is much too strong for that".</seg>
<seg id="20">A banker said that, in Tegernsee, there was "clientele who were rather better off in terms of assets."</seg>
<seg id="21">"That can be a problem for a small bank," if the bank is looking after their money for free.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Cooperative Bank of Gmund was founded in 1911, and has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Famous actors, sportspeople and enterpreneurs live in the region.</seg>
<seg id="24">Spokesperson Ernst said that the Cooperative Association of Bavaria "was not currently aware of any other banks that ask private customers to reimburse their expenses".</seg>
<seg id="25">The President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said at the end of June that "the threshold for tipping into the red in terms of private customers is very, very high".</seg>
<seg id="26">Competition is fierce, and there is the risk that investors will move to competitors.</seg>
<seg id="27">Customers in Germany will not put up with that, broadly speaking.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vinyl destination: who is actually buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to litter the comments section with gnarly insults under the pseudonym NotAllLonelyMiddleAgedMen, this statement derives from actual data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much talked-about record resurgence is driven not by a boom in millennials who want to embrace the novelty of a physical item, but by midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54, apparently.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not just an act of hoarding by hobbyists, either - it has emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% versus 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% versus 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are YouGov's results true?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a televised news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, wearing a modest grey suit and gesturing wildly before stopping, cupping my hands and saying something authoritative like: "So, let's take a look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look.</seg>
<seg id="11">While the heart of Soho is slowly being drained of its charm and grot - hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases now fill the buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a handful of fantastic specialist record shops still remain.</seg>
<seg id="12">I'd probably ask the camera to stop rolling for the next bit, in which I stand very close to various men in some of these stores and attempt to gauge their age and emotional disposition via observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Glaswegian Stuart, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her 20s) is in London for the afternoon for a meeting and is perusing the shops to fill a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I suppose I am," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he emailed me the snap, I didn't follow him home), line his living room walls.</seg>
<seg id="18">His reason for acquiring such a vast number of albums and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally came out, and to repurchase items he sold when he was young and skint.</seg>
<seg id="19">"A lot of the stuff I get is late 60s, early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a bit too young to get," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who purchase records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has, however, noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From conversations I've had, people have got rid of their collection, normally around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back," he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That may explain a boom in vinyl revivalists of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realise that record stores offer a comforting community of likeminded types.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some older customers have taken umbrage with the contactless payment system in particular.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some vinyl fans may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to retreat to the stability of the familiar record sleeve, of items that recall halcyon teenage memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material possessions as some kind of comfort," Wez says.</seg>
<seg id="32">As a collector myself, I have that, and I think a lot of people do.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's an easy way to occupy your headspace.</seg>
<seg id="34">"We're like their social workers!" pipes up a co-worker from a stack of records.</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album the previous month had yet to listen to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who purchase vinyl don't own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this stage of the news report, I would probably be looking gravely concerned while flicking through a stack of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">The "trophy" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three midde-aged men) has noticed.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Someone came in recently and said: "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,"" he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">That's not a large percentage, but it's definitely happening.</seg>
<seg id="41">More of the product side, less of the music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people saying: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">That's younger people, not older ones, late teens who are just getting into it.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which now dedicates almost an entire floor to vinyl, has a far more varied audience when I arrive.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">While the atmosphere is less at ease than the aforementioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synth- and sex-fuelled pop, rather than noodling jazz, is blasting from the speakers - it is good to see diversity in its customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychological trauma is hard to ascertain by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records on sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She is window-shopping, rather than on a spending spree.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't earn a lot, she says, so collecting records isn't really an option.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music by a computer or another way, but the beauty of vinyl is ..." she drifts off into a lovestruck sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop said to have inspired a fresh generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While giving the illusion of perusing the denim hot pants, I observe a group of teenage girls, who cluster around the Polaroid cameras momentarily, before a dad and his daughter deliberate purchasing a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">To the left is a stairwell, a wall of which is stacked with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary and classics, the essential records for any average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody is looking - perhaps because they are merely decoration, some so high up the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "art vinyl."</seg>
<seg id="59">But, given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is little to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a demographic more likely than most to have more time and money than most is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl.</seg>
<seg id="61">But while my findings suggest YouGov's results are accurate, in Soho record stores at least, they do not discount the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record shops and on online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings loitering around the record shops of Berwick Street, flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter who is looming over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Here comes the enforcement trailer</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany's speeders will have to get used to the new generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new speed cameras are being trialled, which are supposed to be particularly effective at catching those who drive too fast.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic-looking enforcement trailer made by Vitronic, a company form Wiesbaden, could be used at accident blackspots, for example, where it is too dangerous for the police to go.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, roadworks on a motorway, or a bridge that is due to be repaired, and therefore has a temporary speed limit often lack the infrastructure to support a fixed speed camera to ensure that speed limits are being adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="5">It can also be too dangerous or expensive to keep assembling and unassembling the speed camera at these points.</seg>
<seg id="6">The enforcement trailer is autonomous: its battery lasts for five days of continuous measurement, and data is transferred in encrypted form via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thanks to laser measuring technology, all vehicles across several lanes can be tracked at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits and driving bans based on time, lane or vehicle type can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">When powered up, the manufacturer says that any car with a trailer coupling can move the trailer.</seg>
<seg id="10">To prevent it from simply being stolen, it sinks down when measuring, making its wheels disappear into the armoured, bullet-proof exterior.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, the speed camera's in-built alarm system is designed to protect it from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now also used in them.</seg>
<seg id="13">Foreign authorities are also using the new technology for speed cameras: recently France ordered 100 of them, after ordering 150 the year before.</seg>

<seg id="2">Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has been some journey for GB.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here, they lost just one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.</seg>
<seg id="22">Which is pretty much how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle</seg>
<seg id="2">There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, it was touch and go.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If they don't it goes everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It alters your outlook a bit.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts off.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very much in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.</seg>
<seg id="33">We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">This feels so much better," she said.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Assocation "sets an example for the entirety of Bavaria".</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Franconian drinking water supply association as a role-model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">That was how the association was described in a segment on Bavarian radio.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later, the Water Forum of the government of Lower Franconia praised the Association.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Veitensteingruppe's work was described as "setting an example for the entirety of Bavaria".</seg>
<seg id="8">Rupert Göller is behind it all: he worked as an employee of the Association for 31 years, and has been its Managing Director for 28.</seg>
<seg id="9">He has now gone into retirement at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Veitensteingruppe Drinking Water Supply Association has its headquarters in Kottendorf in the commune of Breitbrunn, and provides 150,000 cubic metres of water annually, supplying 32 villages and hamlets with around 5,500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The communes of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the municipality of Baunach are also members.</seg>
<seg id="12">Water supply contracts are in place for additional municipalities and communes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayoress Gertrud Bühl (FW), looks back to when Ruper Göller was brought on as a water officer in 1985, and was promoted to Managing Director of the Association as soon as 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"His tasks were very varied, ranging from constructing water pipes and performing maintenance work through to office and organisational tasks, budget planning, calculating fees and contributions, through to getting involved in emergencies at weekends," the chairman said.</seg>
<seg id="15">She pointed out some exceptional successes, including commissioning and opening the new spring (1994), purchasing land near the new spring (1998), compensating farmers, renovating the elevated tanks (1999), creating a new computer management system (2004), and renewing some of the water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Things never stopped, and renovations were always underway: water means life, and drinking water is the most important foodstuff of all.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudatory speech, she praised Göller's loyal, reliable, and upstanding service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He put his heart and soul into the Water Supply Association, and lived for it as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago he gave a presentation at the Water Forum for the District of Lower Franconia as a true practitioner of the Veitensteingruppe's successful nitrate reduction concept.</seg>
<seg id="20">He received considerable appreciation and praise for this.</seg>
<seg id="21">For his part, Rupert Göller praised water officer Alfons Griebel, who had worked alongside him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water officer, and he was a loyal lad.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together, we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">From his perspective, the high point was the construction of the spring and the restructuring of the Association.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the largest challenge and most difficult shift was when the pipe broke on the Kirchlauter elevated tank on 3 January one year.</seg>
<seg id="26">We had to work through the night at minus 17 degrees to ensure the locality would be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even the supply from the new spring was sometimes only maintained because the elevated tank at Pettstadt was filled by hosepipe.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the Drinking Water Supply Association was passed to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who will be Rupert Göller's successor.</seg>

<seg id="2">A 35-year-old man shot and fatally wounded his partner on Friday around 10.45 a.m. in an apartment building in Bargeteheide (in the district of Stormarn).</seg>
<seg id="3">"The man himself called up and admitted to having shot his partner," a police spokeswoman said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator is on the run, she said, and he is officially being sought.</seg>
<seg id="5">This search is now happening across Germany, because Sven S. might be travelling by car.</seg>
<seg id="6">The man is around 1.8 m tall, muscular, sun-tanned, and has a bald patch.</seg>
<seg id="7">The police have now issued a photo of him.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it is a couple of years old.</seg>
<seg id="9">The man now has a bald patch.</seg>
<seg id="10">The man should not be approached.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police believe he may still be carrying a weapon.</seg>
<seg id="12">Anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110.</seg>
<seg id="13">The police are talking of a "crime passionelle".</seg>
<seg id="14">The victim was apparently born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.</seg>
<seg id="15">The police force in Lübeck dealing with the crime initially did not want to disclose any information on the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but it confirmed that a person had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is a homicide."</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - There's a ray of hope for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The German steel industry has been riddled with crises and uses a lot of energy - but it has been spared additional costs that could have run into the millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The sector had been threatened by financial burdens for the promotion of green energy, but these are now off the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">Federal Minister of the Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ) newspaper on Friday that the exemption from the renewable energies levy would remain in place for electricity self-supply for pre-existing plants within the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I am truly delighted by the fact that we have finally reached an agreement after two years of intense negotiations."</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission had originally planned to make steel manufacturers, who use the gases from their blast furnaces to generate electricity for their own use, pay a levy.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German association for the sector, the steel industry was threatened with additional costs ranging from 120 to 240 million euros a year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told WAZ that a basic agreement had now been reached with the EU Commission, following discussions with Margrethe Vestager, the Commissioner for Competition.</seg>
<seg id="9">The EEG levy of 20 percent is now only due when the generators in the steelworks are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="10">This too will not be levied against the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the agreement Germany had reached with the EU Commission on electricity self-generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The agreement sees the status quo of the previous ruling largely formalised.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's positive efforts are particularly important for the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It is the first step within our "steel is the future" campaign."</seg>
<seg id="15">"This needs to be followed by other steps."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Climate targets and employment objectives also need to be taken into account during negotiations to reform emissions allowances," explained IG Metall's CEO, Jörg Hofmann, in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis of 2008, Europe's steel sector has suffered from overcapacities and considerable pressure in terms of pricing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The situation only worsened over the past year when the world' biggest producer, China, dumped steel into the global market en masse as a result of weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel firms of price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">The situation improved slightly during spring of this year.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import taxes started to have an impact on imported steel, on the other, economic prospects in China brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how long prices will remain perked up for.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German sector leader, Thyssenkrupp, was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Prices had plateaued recently, he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">The sector is reacting to the tricky situation by reducing prices further.</seg>
<seg id="26">Thyssenkrupp also did not want to rule out closing individual plants.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in Germany's steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remained cautious in July.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tons, they produced a good six percent less raw steel than in the corresponding month in the previous year, as the steel association reported on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief spike in May, the amounts produced shrunk for a second consecutive month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the start of the year, production has been two percent less than the value for the equivalent period in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="32">The association is expecting output to increase over the next few months thanks to an improved situation in terms of orders.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing is good for the elderly</seg>
<seg id="2">Singing has been a constant throughout Ursel Kipp's entire life: as a young girl she sang in her school choir, when she was studying to be a teacher she took music classes, and today, the 78-year-old sings in a choir for the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, happy, and generally more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">And additionally, she's doing something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singing is a great hobby for the elderly for a host of reasons, says Erhard Hackler from the German Association for the Elderly.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most elderly people sing in a choir and share the enjoyment they get from music with like-minded people, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">By regularly spending time with others, the elderly can build and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Social and familial structures often weaken as people grow older - so choir is a perfect way to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ursel Kipp has also experienced this in her choir: "Arranging and organising things with people, being able to rely on others and learn from them - a choir is a really unique way of being together with other people".</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be demanding in the positive sense, Hackler thinks.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is because it teaches the elderly to breathe deeply and in a controlled manner.</seg>
<seg id="13">If you push your lungs to their limits regularly, you will not run out of breath as quickly in day-to-day life.</seg>
<seg id="14">And if you are interested in keeping the sound of your voice as you age, too, singing is the perfect hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">Singing often has a really special effect on older people, says Ursula LEnz from the German Association of Senior Citizens' Associations.</seg>
<seg id="16">For older generations, singing together is seen as more important, it was part of their daily life both at school and in their leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often sees that singing or listening to songs often triggers memories in older people that are often connected to positive emotions from their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Song texts, and melodies in particular, can even be used to help patients with dementia to remember things from far back in their past.</seg>
<seg id="19">Singing also demands particular mental exertion, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Concentrating on one's own voice and a set rhythm, while adapting to the other singers - that is a huge cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">In particular, older people who live alone can practice how to focus on people other than themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition gained by singing in a choir, Hackler thinks.</seg>
<seg id="23">A happy audience is great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even one's self-esteem is boosted by singing in a choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">Being able to show yourself that by practising for a long time, you can improve and grow - this experience gives you strength.</seg>
<seg id="26">So there are enough good reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, don't delay - even if you think you've not got much talent, Lenz suggests.</seg>
<seg id="28">You're not singing by yourself - and in a group of 50 people singing, who'll hear if a note's out here or there?</seg>
<seg id="29">The elderly have many options when looking for the right fit, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone you know already sings in a choir for the elderly, you can just go along with them.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition, many towns offer an overview of the choirs in their region.</seg>
<seg id="32">If you want to sing in a church choir, you can approach the parish or churchwarden directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many choirs for the elderly can also be found online.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you don't have access to the internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbours to help you look things up online.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you're interested in singing, you should absolutely join a choir, Hackler thinks.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and is a kind of release - no matter how old you are.</seg>

<seg id="1">Female cats react more sensitively than male cats to the mewls of their kittens</seg>
<seg id="2">Biologists in Hanover have researched the effect kittens' cries have on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To their surprise, the miaowing didn't leave the male cats unaffected - but, compared to their female counterparts, they always acted the same way.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can tell how agitated kittens are by their miaowing.</seg>
<seg id="5">They react ten percent quicker to kittens who sound to be in great distress, the scientists from the Veterinary University and Medical University of Hanover discovered.</seg>
<seg id="6">Male cats do respond to kittens' cries - but always to the same extent.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is clear that the acoustic differences between the miaows of kittens that are more or less agitaged are either imperceptible or unimportant for male cats," the biologists Wiebke Konerding, from MHH, said.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" specialist journal this Friday.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous experiment the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of a kitten's miaow changes depending on how urgently they need help.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nine adult male cats and eight female cats from the MHH's animal husbandry programme were examined.</seg>
<seg id="11">Firstly, they were played the sound of a kitten who had been taken from the birthing box and separated from its mother and siblings for three minutes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then they were played the sound of a more agitated cat, which had also been lifted up.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite the low sample size, the researchers believe the results to be significant.</seg>
<seg id="14">"All females, even those who did not have their offspring, were able to differentiate between miaows," said Konerding.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned towards the speaker quicker if it was playing the sound of a highly agitated kitten.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be innate, or may develop as the animal reaches sexual maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"One surprise was that the male cats reacted at all," the biologist said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have researched women's and men's reactions to babies' cries on multiple occasions.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even in this field a few studies showed that woman reacted more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they had their own children or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.</seg>

<seg id="1">Podolski and "Gala" are shooting for the Supercup</seg>
<seg id="2">Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="3">An arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey for the former football star Hakan Sükür.</seg>
<seg id="4">He is accused of being a member of a terrorist organisation.</seg>
<seg id="5">An important football match is taking place in Turkey for the first time following the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ahead of the duel between arch-rivals Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "business as usual".</seg>
<seg id="7">Even when announcing the state of emergency after the attempted coup in July, the government emphasised that this would not affect citizens' daily life.</seg>
<seg id="8">This does not apply to those people suspected of being followers of the imam Fethulla Gülen, who is believed to be responsible for the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="9">And this doesn't stop for football.</seg>
<seg id="10">The state prosecutor has issued a warrant for the arrest of former star striker Hakan Sükür.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sükür, who now lives in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist organisation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sükür is accused of being a follower of the imam Fethullah Gülen, whom President Recep Tayyip Erdogan holds responsible for the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="13">While the state of emergency, declared for ninety days, will continue until October, it is having practically no effect on the lives of most Turks.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Wednesday, Erdogan announced that the night-time "democracy vigils" in public places across the country have come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sport - like the entire country - is divided into those who support Erdogan, and those who do not.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fans of the workers' club Besiktas, in particular, are not traditionally counted among the President's friends.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the strict rejection of military coups is what brings most Turks together, in the light of dramatic historical events.</seg>
<seg id="18">And even the fans can agree on that - whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.</seg>
<seg id="19">For cup winners Gala, it will once again depend on Lukas Podolski.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Cologne native has proved his sporting value over the last season: with 17 goals and nine assists across all competitions, the 31-year-old closed his first season as his club's top scorer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the goal that led to a 1-0 victory.</seg>
<seg id="22">The "Fanatik" newspaper praised him, saying "he was the best player on the pitch."</seg>
<seg id="23">He finished the season in style, and secured the cup for his team.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record-holders came to a happy end.</seg>
<seg id="25">After their knockout in the heats for the Champions League, the "Lions" also left the Europa League early on.</seg>
<seg id="26">They only reached sixth place in the Süper Lig.</seg>
<seg id="27">The season was not good.</seg>
<seg id="28">The cup was the only chance to win something.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We did it - and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.</seg>
<seg id="30">Winners Besiktas saw a better year of play.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is mainly thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the groundwork for their fourteenth title with 26 matches in the season as the Süper Lig's star goalkeeper.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also why fans are hoping that the 31-year-old returns.</seg>
<seg id="33">Gomez, under contract at AC Florenz and only on loan to Besktas, announced after the attempted coup that he would not return to the country after his European Championship holiday due to the political situation.</seg>
<seg id="34">"But if Mario wants to come here, all he has to do is say," "Kicker" specialist magazine quoted club chairman Fikret Orman as saying.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, the star would have to be prepared to give up around a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, as Orman made clear: "We cannot pay the salary that Florenz do".</seg>

<seg id="1">Despite doping: These athletes are still in with a chance of winning medals in Rio</seg>
<seg id="2">Justin Gatlin, aged 34, has already been banned twice for doping (in 2001 and 2006).</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is banned from taking her place on the start line.</seg>
<seg id="4">Other track athletes who have been found guilty can only laugh - they are in Rio competing for medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue of doping continues to hit the headlines during the Olympic Games in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who appealed against her doping conviction shortly before the games to enable herself to compete, was booed and shouted at as she started her 100-metre breaststroke race.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was a bizarre scene: She waltzed into the pool with a smile plastered on her face, a deliberately provocative entrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">As it became clear that she would not take the gold medal, the audience cheered enthusiastically.</seg>
<seg id="9">But there are many other athletes preparing to line up on the start line at the Olympic Games in Rio despite having been involved in doping in the past.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here is an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial track athletes.</seg>
<seg id="12">He has already been banned twice for doping (in 2001 and from 2006 to 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since being banned, the 2004 Olympic champion and former World Champion is running faster than ever before: covering 100m in 9.80 seconds, he is the world number one, and is Usain Bolt's major challenger.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time World Champion was handed a six-month ban in 2010 after she was proved to have taken Oxycodone.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 29-year-old defended herself by saying she had suffered with bad toothache after an operation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sandra Perkovic (discus/Croatia): in 2011, the 2012 Olympic Chamption, 2013 World Champion and 2010-2016 European Champion tested positive for the banned stimulant methyhexaminine.</seg>
<seg id="17">Perkovic said that she had not knowingly taken the drug, and was banned for six months.</seg>
<seg id="18">This year's four longest throws were by the woman tipped for gold.</seg>
<seg id="19">LaShawn Merrit (200, 400 4x400m relay/USA): Champion at the Beijing Olympics and two-time 400m World Champion, Merrit tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.</seg>
<seg id="20">Merritt claimed that a penis enlargement drug was to blame.</seg>
<seg id="21">This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world in the 200m and the 400m.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ivan Tichon (hammer, Belarus): There is hardly another athlete who has been retrospectively stripped of so many medals.</seg>
<seg id="23">Tichon lost his 2005 World Championship title nine years later after he was proved to have been involved in testosterone doping.</seg>
<seg id="24">Now 40 years old, he was also stripped of his 2004 Olympic silver medal for doping with steroids, and his 2006 European Champion title for testosterone misuse.</seg>
<seg id="25">His bronze medal from the 2008 Olympics was also taken away, but it was returned to him following a decision by the International Court of Arbitration for Sport, CAS.</seg>
<seg id="26">With 80.04m he is at second place in the global rankings.</seg>
<seg id="27">Liu Hong (20km walking, China): The world record holder and favourite to win gold tested positive as far back as May, but will still be on the start line in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="28">The 29-year-old world champion revealed traces of a banned dietary supplement, but the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)'s ban was lenient, and ended as early as July 13.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bomb terror in Thailand - One Austrian woman injured - Several dead</seg>
<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Thomas Schnöll, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, said early on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She has some cuts, he says, and was treated in hospital, but has already been able to leave hospital.</seg>
<seg id="4">She plans to return home at the start of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is currently unclear whether other Austrian citizens have been affected by the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket or in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumpon.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Schnöll, the Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with local authorities as a result.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hua Hin, located around 200 kilometres south of the capital city, Bangkok, two bombs went off in the nightlife district on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to police reports, a Thai woman was killed and around 20 people injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three people from Holland and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were another two explosions early on Friday morning, with another person killed, according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported in Phuket early in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">Police reports state that a taxi driver was injured in the explosion, which occurred near Patong beach, popular with holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="12">Another bomb exploded in Surat Thani on the country's south-east coast, which led to the death of a civil servant.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive device was launched from a flower bed on the edge of the coastal police's territory.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, explosions in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast caused several casualties.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is apparently a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The bomb attacks bear the same signature," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee to journalists early on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We are assuming that the attacks were coordinated".</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to speculate on possible motives, he says - however, it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that was typical of Islamic separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, the Thai police issued a statement that the attacks were not connected with the Islamist resistance movement or with global terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It is just local sabotage, limited to particular areas and provinces," said a spokesperson in Bangkok.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is more reasonable to assume that the bombs were set off by opponents of the military junta currently ruling the country.</seg>
<seg id="23">Over the past few days, the authorities have received notification from the security services about attacks planned in the south of the country - but they do not know when and where exactly the attacks are planned for.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still apparently unclear who is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police told civil servants across the entire country to increase security around important governmental buildings, along with airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and nightlife districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">Small-scale bombings are a frequent occurrence in Thailand, but they are rarely directed at tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is a palace in Hua Hin that was used by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej for years.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry has issued a recommendation on its homepage that Austrians follow the instructions from the Thai security agencies at all times.</seg>
<seg id="29">The provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, along with Preah Vihear and its surroundings, have been issued with a high security alert (security level 3).</seg>
<seg id="30">After skirmishes between security forces and Muslim sectors of the population, people are advised against all but essential travel to these districts.</seg>
<seg id="31">The rest of the country is on an increased security alert (security level 2).</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday came just a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This will give the military large-scale influence even in the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Head of the junta, and Prime Minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos when the country was heading towards stability, an improved economic climate and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta took power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, and believes that it has led the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not managed to quell the latent resistance brewing with Muslim rebels in the southern edges of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict so far.</seg>
<seg id="38">A little under a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bankok - the majority of whom were foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the most bloody attack in the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has the right-wing "Identitäre Bewegung" movement in its sights.</seg>
<seg id="2">After several regional authorities had done so, the body charged with protecting the constitution across Germany has also put the group on a watchlist.</seg>
<seg id="3">"In terms of the "Identitäre Bewegung" movement, we can see clear indicators of efforts against the free, democratic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection, to the German press agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">Muslim migrants or migrants from the Middle East were vilified in an extremist manner.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why we will also be monitoring the movement from henceforth.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Identitäre Bewegung" is a group with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">It fights against "multicultural madness", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and "the loss of national identity through foreigners".</seg>
<seg id="8">Bodies protecting the constitution across nine federal states - Bremen, Bavarian, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already have the "Identitäre" under observation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Maaßen said that his authority had worked closely with regional authorities to come to its decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Groups such as the "Identitäre Bewegung" are trying to approach their target group on their level," said the head of constitutional protection.</seg>
<seg id="11">In general, extremists attempt to speak to them in young people's own language, often with pop music.</seg>
<seg id="12">Radical Islamists and right-wing extremists both do this.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's not calm advertisement for the actual matter at hand.</seg>
<seg id="14">This propaganda is designed to provoke an emotional response in people.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly vulnerable to this.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently, there have been reports from several federal states pointing out contact between members of the "Identitäre" movement and AfD politicians.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maaßen said he had no information on this.</seg>
<seg id="19">In terms of constitutional protection, potential contact of this kind only becomes relevant from a certain point, he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It depends on whether the party in question - in this case, the AfD - changes its focus and becomes extremist as a result of particular people who are extremists.</seg>
<seg id="21">Therefore, the decisive factor is whether these people exert a controlling influence over the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This has not been noted.</seg>
<seg id="23">With regard to the clear increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of a new right-wing terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="24">But, over the past few years, we have determined that right-wing terrorist structures can exist.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the "Old School Society" group or the "Freitaler Group".</seg>
<seg id="26">It can absolutely be the case that additional right-wing terrorist groups or small gatherings come to exist, and plan attacks on asylum seekers, refugee shelters, or for other far-right motives.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, there is no Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of far-right terrorism that we can discern.</seg>
<seg id="28">The groups that have existed to date have arisen on a regional level or via social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Maaßen expressed concern that many attacks were perpetrated by people who had previously not been involved in the far-right scene.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is frightening.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of those suspected of carrying out the attacks on asylum centers were not viewed as criminals, politically motivated perpetrators or members of the far-right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">"This means that many people have committed crimes who previously paid the far-right no heed, who might have been politically indifferent or voted for the CDU, SPD or the Left, who were then radicalised by far-right sensationalism".</seg>

<seg id="1">Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet sensation</seg>
<seg id="2">Olympic athletes or world records aren't always the only things to hit the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is shown by Robel Kiros Habte's brave performance at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Centre, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that, sometimes, it was impossible to see him in the televised images.</seg>
<seg id="5">He just disappeared - no matter how wide a perspective was used.</seg>
<seg id="6">Habte finally become a viral internet sensation on social networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 24-year-old completed his heat 48 seconds slower than the next-fastest competitor, taking place 59 out of 59.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, it was his not-quite sporty figure that caught the eye of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why was the 24-year-old taking part in the Olympic games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian was given special permission to take part by the international swimming federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is given out to popularise swimming in underrepresented countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because most athletes from Ethiopia run, Habte wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte prepared himself for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames were soon doing the rounds.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media outlets dubbed him "Robel the whale".</seg>
<seg id="16">With reference to his "flabby stomach", the British tabloid "The Sun" mocked his "Dad Bod".</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, almost one minute and five seconds for the 100 metre freestyle, played no part in this.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons were also made with "Eric the Eel".</seg>
<seg id="19">At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's race also drew media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">The performance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable: he had to swim his 100 metre freestyle heat all on his own.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was then greeted by wild cheering.</seg>
<seg id="22">He was 22 years old at the time, and had learnt to swim eight months before the Olympics - and had never managed such a long distance before the competition began.</seg>

<seg id="2">Consumer research firm GfK is replacing its managing director Matthias Hartmann.</seg>
<seg id="3">His resignation came swiftly - but it was not a complete surprise.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tricky situation in which market research firm GfK finds itself made it self-evident that Managing Director Matthias Harmann's seat became more and more unstable the longer the success he promised failed to materialise.</seg>
<seg id="5">Turbulence at the top of Nuremberg's market research firm GfK: After another round of disappointing figures and the resignation of the managing director, the firm, fifth in its sector globally, is on the brink of a personal new start.</seg>
<seg id="6">GfK's managing director wants to leave the company at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The managing director of GfK's supervisory board, Arno Mahlert, has already announced that he will be leaving the supervisory committee with effect from 12 September.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company announced that Gerhard Hausruckinger, who is currently a member of the board of directors, will take over the management of the board on 1 September.</seg>
<seg id="9">Officially, he will take on the role of "board spokesman" until Hartmann's successor has been found.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company cited "different viewpoints" on long-term business direction as the reason behind the resignation.</seg>
<seg id="11">A company spokesman did not give further details on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is currently not clear who will head up the market research firm in the future.</seg>
<seg id="13">In investment circles, on Friday it was said that shareholders were greatly disappointed by the lack of success following the restructuring programme implemented years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Hartman has headed up GfK since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The benefits of the restructuring programme will only become visible after 5 years," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a result of GfK's recent poor figures, every shareholder would be a little unsettled, he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">"If that were the case at BMW, the quants would be too," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">After suffering losses in the previous quarters, the company was unable to stop losing money in the second quarter of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="19">At 361.2 million euros, turnover was 6.1 lower than it had been in the same quarter of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="20">Compared to the first six months of the year, turnover (721.2 million euros) had shrunk by 3.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">The company's reduced value because of the difficult economic climate had impacted second-quarter profits, in particular.</seg>

<seg id="1">From 1 October 2016, fees per cubic metre of sewage for the area covered by the sewage plant at Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl will be 3.44 euros instead of 2.10 euros as previously, 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp, and 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros) for Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="2">The sewage fee for the sewage works in Azendorf will be raised again if it is necessary to carry out improvement works.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an estimated calculation, sewage fees in Azendorf will then come to 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the district administration of Kulmbach approved the budget, it was determined that these sewage plants were underfunded.</seg>
<seg id="5">The market town of Kasendorf is legally obliged to run the sewage works so that they break even.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, individuals and commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig a little deeper.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As administrative director Herbert Schmidt showed the committee, it was necessary to recalculate the fees for the sewage plants serving the market town.</seg>
<seg id="9">Between October 2016 and September 2020, overfunding and underfunding from the previous calculation period will be balanced out.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt justifies the major fee increases by saying that all three sewage plants are relatively small and deal with a very small amount of waste, namely between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres a pear.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution, expenses for critical repairs amounting to several thousand euros, for example, seem major.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the amount of sewage arriving at all three plants is gradually decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, the previous calculation period did not include renovation and repair works to a great extent for all three treatment plants, not least because of their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants in Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the waste treatment plant at Azendorf needed to have its mechanical ventilation system replaced because of damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">The conveyor system in the pumping station at Welschenkahl is almost 20 years old, and needs to be completely overhauled; the first clarification pond in the pond treatment plant at Lopp has been operational for almost 20 years and now needs to be dredged, its sewage sludge removed, and an additional ventilation system incorporated to ensure that it will be in line with water law regulations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were also coupled with perpetual support and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same is true for electricity costs: in the previous calculations for 2011/2012, they are far below their current levels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Steinhäuser pointed out that, even with a low amount of sewage coming to the three plants, the expenses for running and maintaining them "were significantly impacted".</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, Schmidt expanded, the market town had been saved from large maintenance costs for the sewage treatment plants over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">From Steinhäuser's perspective, the plants mentioned will remain in a precarious situation in the long run, especially as the area covered by Friesenbachtal wastewater association cannot be expanded to include these plants because they are running at a deficit.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Any missteps quickly enter the public record.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.</seg>
<seg id="8">So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."</seg>
<seg id="9">And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.</seg>
<seg id="12">But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."</seg>
<seg id="25">Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.</seg>
<seg id="28">For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says</seg>
<seg id="2">Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).</seg>
<seg id="27">But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.</seg>
<seg id="28">The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no clue," she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.</seg>
<seg id="10">However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bam was on that team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.</seg>
<seg id="15">The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We've made a complete turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.</seg>
<seg id="21">She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.</seg>
<seg id="24">She is on a roll.</seg>
<seg id="25">So is Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Fury of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a furious relay of competition and striving.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming baton, passed from archer to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on a television, read a newspaper or listen in on your neighbor's conversation in a coffee-shop line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr. Dooley, a first-time Olympian and a dimpled heartthrob in the making, may well be among those household names being showcased in prime time, buoyed by sponsorships and feel-good TV commercials, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Mr. Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., is competing for the gold in Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event equally.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in shadow, are those sports not universally acknowledged: air-pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke, and long may it reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I may make a modest case for my particular favorite, let me call attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Though trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has spent the intervening 16 years so barely acknowledged that many I surveyed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This may be a regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite sending athletes to compete, the United States has never won a medal in trampoline and did not have an athlete advance to the finals until 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to split the prizes for the men, and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will be defending their London gold medals this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">But there is an underdog charm to trampoline, in part because it sounds, to the unenlightened ear, fitter for clown college than the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">Here I should confess that I am no expert, just an earthbound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It does have comic potential - the cartoon quaver of its never-ending bounce - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" derives from the Spanish el trampolín, meaning "diving board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shooting up to nearly 30 feet in the air, and are called upon to perform a series of tumbling moves (twists, pikes and somersaults) before eventually landing on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are judged on execution, difficulty and "flight time," according to the official Olympic program.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medal hopefuls must go farther, faster, up and over, in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, other times back and forth up and down the court.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are chasing not only the finish line or the starting wall but also, in the televised coverage, another taunting line: that of the world, or Olympic, record.</seg>
<seg id="28">This single-minded pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to bring even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find slightly exhausting about even watching the Games.</seg>
<seg id="30">From this, trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The trampoliner's vector is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">Forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she rebounds, seeming weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is not without competition, of course, nor without difficulty, but for the duration of a routine, there is no frantic charge toward the end, no vaulting into the distance, just the dreamy, graceful suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as close to Zen as Olympic competition gets.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualifiers and then finals will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 1 p.m. Eastern time; the men's on Saturday, also at 1.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, lovely moment, one likely to be overlooked in the general melee.</seg>
<seg id="39">And if consciousness raising is to be achieved only by offering up male athletes for ogling and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley only awaits his gasping new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"A Generation Is Protesting" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. Ally</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent Protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have been met with violent resistance by the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that scores of protesters have been fatally shot during clashes with police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia about to crack?</seg>
<seg id="6">For the last decade, it has been one Africa's most stable nations, a solid Western ally with a fast-growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, anti-government protests have convulsed the country, spreading into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last week alone, thousands of people stormed into the streets, demanding fundamental political change.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government response, according to human rights groups, was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos circulating from protests thought to be from late last year or earlier this year show security officers whipping young people with sticks as they were forced to perform handstands against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It was always difficult holding this country together, and moving forward, it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa, after Nigeria, and its stability is cherished by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia, and few if any countries in Africa receive as much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy has been expanding at an impressive clip.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">And its streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Though Ethiopia has hardly been a paragon of democracy - human rights groups have constantly cited the government's repressiveness - opposition within the country had been limited, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many have been exiled, jailed, killed or driven to the far reaches of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that may be changing.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If you suffocate people and they don't have any other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">The complaints are many, covering everything from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the governing party and its allies got the last seat the opposition had held and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle along that jagged, disputed line claimed hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatist groups that had been more or less vanquished in recent years, like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the turbulence and rearm.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why bitter feelings, after years of simmering beneath the surface, are exploding now.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first is seemingly innocuous: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in the last couple of years have large numbers of Ethiopians been able to communicate using social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet service improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it frequently does, especially during protests, many people are still able to communicate via internet proxies that mask where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">Second, there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="35">Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is changing as well.</seg>
<seg id="38">"We are on the way to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests have been in Amhara and Oromo areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos feel Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and dominates the military, the intelligence services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason behind the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an undisclosed illness in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was especially adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using emissaries to massage and defang opponents.</seg>
<seg id="45">"The current regime lacks that ground savvy," Mr. Abdi, the conflict analyst, said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was plucked from relative obscurity to fill Mr. Meles's shoes.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is a southerner.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not have the trust of the Tigrayan-controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">The result, many fear, is more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protested over what analysts have said appeared to be an election the government bungled and then stole.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and measurable strides in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But clearly that has not stopped the internal resentment of Ethiopia's government from intensifying.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it is taking a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and anti-Tigrayan hatred is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently said it closed that base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to crumble.</seg>
<seg id="59">"That," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very tight rope to walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump Explains His Obama-Founded-ISIS Claim as "Sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to quash the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.</seg>
<seg id="3">The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also put his surrogates, who have strained to defend him during a tumultuous stretch, in the awkward position of having to explain remarks that he might not mean.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the suggestion at a rally on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump doubled down on the assertion on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did intend to say that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early-morning Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said that he was just being sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The post was a reversal from just a day ago, when Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee would not have it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The latest firestorm comes as Mr. Trump has been trying to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining poll numbers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave dueling economic speeches in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to that subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Taking again to Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would come with higher taxes and he said that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.</seg>
<seg id="14">In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by appearing to suggest that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">The approach allows Mr. Trump to push the limits of political speech and dial it back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's a pattern of him testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they play, and then "clarifying" one way or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been monitoring the language used by both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through various lenses.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of toning things down for a general election audience, Mr. Trump has taken an even more caustic tone in recent days as his poll numbers have continued to tumble.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed Mr. Trump trailing Mrs. Clinton by large margins in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and locked in a tight race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as he faces heightened scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have put his loyal allies in the uncomfortable position of having to publicly stand up for him no matter how provocative his remarks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is one of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he's saying there is legitimate, political commentary," Mr. Giuliani said when questioned about the veracity of Mr. Trump's assertion about Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton having founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in a sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small little organization, he who called it the jayvee, totally wrong, and here's why it happened, because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to fester by failing to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ahead of rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued to lash out on Twitter at the news media for harping on his every word and for being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who try to figure him out and said, "They can't!"</seg>
<seg id="28">Some Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's excuse as more evidence that he is unfit to be president.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once Priced Out, a Cafe Returns in Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Naturally, it got priced out of its Bedford Avenue storefront.</seg>
<seg id="4">The store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is change, I know, but still, can't believe CBGB's is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is gutted and Verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, it is also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards but has some of the same employees and a similar unpretentious vibe.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good, too.</seg>
<seg id="11">Leading the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee at the old cafe who is an owner and the general manager at the new place.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started at Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to bankroll him in a new outpost, he said he was excited to do it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels and bought the same model of espresso machine.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even reused the lights from the old Verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Mr. Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings like capers and sautéed onions are available.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are brown-rice bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">The cafe no longer serves beer but now makes fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nine months in, Mr. Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regulars.</seg>
<seg id="23">"A lot of former customers got priced out of Williamsburg too," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ms. Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and went to Verb frequently.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would still make the trek.</seg>
<seg id="27">After Verb closed, she said, she gave up drinking coffee for a while.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I realized it was the coffee and the culture at Verb that I liked," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she's back on coffee, although that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she went with a blended chai drink, another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, went faithfully to Verb starting in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He'd go before work and order the same thing without fail.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Quarter past seven, every day, like clockwork, I'd come in and they were making my everything bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">These days, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his regular order, but sometimes he'll switch things up with the bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mr. Rodriguez said he had no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb, using the cafe's cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we still might take them up on it," Mr. Rodriguez said.</seg>
<seg id="38">And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have embraced the cafe as well.</seg>
<seg id="39">One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to find a spot to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The new location has other perks.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice spot wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance the cafe will expand into an adjacent building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new Verb to get their old favorites is enough.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was heartbroken when they closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new space opened, Mr. Whitt said, walking in and getting a coffee felt like a homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I've needed to smell that," he said.</seg>

<seg id="3">A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."</seg>
<seg id="9">Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.</seg>
<seg id="12">When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Coe grimaced.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.</seg>
<seg id="35">Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was fabulously out of touch.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the cream-puff incident.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.</seg>
<seg id="52">Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.</seg>
<seg id="53">Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.</seg>
<seg id="54">Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."</seg>

<seg id="3">He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the Syrian people.</seg>
<seg id="4">He risked everything to save other people's lives.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now the 30-year-old has been killed in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="6">Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group which, according to Bild newspaper, had saved the lives of 60,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="7">2,900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people from bombed-out houses and perform first-aid in the war zone.</seg>
<seg id="8">They are the heroes of the war in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="9">Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil protection volunteer showing him during an 11-hour operation to rescue an infant from the ruins of a house went viral in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="10">It made the Syrian a glowing figurehead amidst the horror of the war.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, he never saw himself as a hero, saying, according to Bild: "For me, this is the real jihad."</seg>
<seg id="12">"If I were to die saving lives, I would think that God saw me as a martyr."</seg>
<seg id="13">Shortly before Omar himself became a victim of an attack, he had spoken in a video about the recent bomb attacks on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Helicopters had released four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one of which was filled with chlorine gas.</seg>
<seg id="15">One woman and two children were killed, and seven people have been left with breathing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We are now clearing away the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," quoted Bild as his last words before he died.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">It's a rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks generally only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being examined on board the research ship "Sanna", this shark was returned to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and has swum through the North Atlantic at 1km/h right through to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only give birth to young at the age of 150.</seg>
<seg id="7">Greenland sharks swim leisurely along the sea floor of the North Atlantic, covering an average of 1,220 metres in an hour.</seg>
<seg id="8">The five-metre-long animal can ramp this up to 2.6 km/h if necessary - but this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this slow pace of life seems to be the key to a long life.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues wrote an article in "Science", the specialist journal, about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's crazy," says Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock about this lifespan - which is a world record for a vertebrate.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is true that evolutionary biologists had long thought that Greenland sharks had been around for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="13">They were simply lacking the proof.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is hard to observe Greenland sharks, namely because they mainly live in the ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">They generally only come to the surface in winter because they prefer water temperatures of around six degrees Celsius.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a result, researchers know little about how Greenland sharks live.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow speed was measured by researchers off Svalbard, who fitted six animals with a tracker.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, these sharks still manage to catch prey: In one animal's stomach, researchers found the remains of a seal; another shark had gobbled down the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">It may be the case that they hunt down sleeping animals, or patrol on the ocean floor and look out for corpses that have sunk downwards from higher levels of water.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks caught in the depths of the North Atlantic by fishermen between 2010 and 2013 off the coast of Greenland or Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest measured 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="22">They use carbon-14 dating on the shark's lens core to determine the shark's age.</seg>
<seg id="23">This core of the eye's lens comes into being even before the shark is born, and the proteins in it are not renewed subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had remarkably high levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores.</seg>
<seg id="25">Consequently, they were likely born after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons experiments released large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">By contrast, the lens cores of third-smallest animal, at 220 centimetres long, contained less of a surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons experiments - so when it was examined in 2012, it must have already had its 50th birthday.</seg>
<seg id="27">By contrast, all the larger Greenland sharks had normal levels of carbon-14 in their lens cores, which comes from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 monitor gave a 493-centimetre-long Greenland shark an age of 335, while the record-holding shark, at 502 centimetres, was apparently 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was already known that female Greenland sharks first had offspring when they were more than four metres long.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now researchers have been able to map this length onto an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals, 392 centimetres long, was likely on the threshold of sexual maturity, and had an age of 156, it seems that Greenland sharks take at least 150 years to be able to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not by chance that such Methuselahs predominantly live in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip was lodged, was caught off Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">As a result of low temperatures, the systems of the animals living there often run on as little energy as possible.</seg>
<seg id="36">This means they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">The animals often become particularly large so they stay warm in cold waters.</seg>
<seg id="38">This is because their volume increases much quicker than their surface area, through which the animal radiates heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">This means that the heat lost per gram of a mouse is much bigger than that lost per gram of an elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage is that they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"This means that a smaller animal has a more dangerous life, and has to focus on having as many offspring as quickly as possible," explains Scheuerlein, an evolutionary biologist.</seg>
<seg id="42">By contrast, a very large animal can invest its resources in having a longer life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The commune's council focused on construction-related topics in its most recent session.</seg>
<seg id="3">The committee was pleased to hear mayor Robert Putz' announcement that "we can finally begin to market the residential construction sites that have recently been marked out".</seg>
<seg id="4">After plot, parcelling and accessibility questions had been answered, and applications for measurements had been made, there was nothing standing in the way of the sale of the plots in the residential areas of "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (near Binderstraße - development section 1) to interested parties.</seg>
<seg id="5">The communal council is convinced that the construction sites in the rural, peaceful residential commune of Schönau will attract young families and older people alike.</seg>
<seg id="6">As said, people prepared to build on these sites should apply in the town hall from now, and the communal council will probably discuss giving out the plots in its September meeting.</seg>
<seg id="7">So that it would be able to answer questions on the movement of additional businesses, in connection with the creation of jobs, the communal council decided to amend the space usage plan first re-drawn in spring of this year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frankfurt will benefit from Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">The city on the river Main will soon have the best chance against the competition of Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg to draw jobs and companies away from London.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," said Michael Voigtländer, Head of IW's Financial Markets and Real Estate specialist area.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum it is unclear whether financial institutions will still be allowed to run European financial business from London.</seg>
<seg id="5">Registration in the UK is all that has been required to date for the "EU passport".</seg>
<seg id="6">This is generally used by large US banks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The "Frankfurt Main Finance" lobbying group expects to see 10,000 new jobs on the river Main within five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the IW, the European Central Bank (ECB)'s headquarters, responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the eurozone, all come together to represent a real plus for Frankfurt, along with further important authorities, such as EIOPA, Europe's insurance regulator, and ESRB, the risk board.</seg>
<seg id="10">While Paris has the headquarters of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks - they can communicate directly with the authorities," says IW's Professor Voigtländer.</seg>
<seg id="12">While Luxembourg is home to a large funds industry, like Dublin, its infrastructure lets it down.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thanks to its large airport, Frankfurt is considerably easier to get to.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the city's easily available business properties are a win.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Paris it's not all that easy to find vacant high-quality offices," said Voigtländer.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rents for top-class business properties are 50% higher on the banks of the Seine than on the banks of the Main.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Frankfurt can offer better quality of life than its competitors, thanks to its good medical systems and infrastructure, and low crime levels.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a table compiled by management consultants Mercer, the city was ranked 7th, Luxembourg 19th, Dublin 33rd and Paris 37 th.</seg>
<seg id="19">And even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "Thanks to its already strong position as a financial hub for the European domestic market, Frankfurt could be able to attract additional banks and investors," IW concluded.</seg>
<seg id="20">Despite the Brexit vote, London will remain Europe's financial capital, according to the economic researchers.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also to do with strength ratios: According to figures from regional bank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in banking in London in 2015 - compared to 62,500 in Frankfurt.</seg>

<seg id="3">In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate</seg>
<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="16">Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.</seg>

<seg id="2">Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way of keeping elephants from wandering into human settlements - by throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.</seg>
<seg id="3">The method has proved effective and Honeyguide Foundation, which hit upon the idea several years ago, with U.S.-based Nature Conservancy has stepped up its promotion, training volunteers in villages in north Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting their homes and crops without hurting the animals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Previously many used spears to defend themselves.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of the animals.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have seen an attitude change within these communities whereby they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">The first two steps involve shining a torch at the trespassing elephant and sounding a horn.</seg>
<seg id="8">If it is not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.</seg>
<seg id="9">Chilli powder mixed with soil is packed with a firecracker into a condom, its end is twisted shut with just the fuse exposed.</seg>
<seg id="10">When lit, the condom bursts open with a bang, spraying a fine dust of chilli powder into the air.</seg>
<seg id="11">One whiff is usually enough to send an elephant the other way.</seg>
<seg id="12">A last resort is a launcher that shoots a Roman candle firework into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News</seg>
<seg id="2">A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="5">The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?</seg>
<seg id="7">Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."</seg>
<seg id="11">The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were appalled and shocked by the incident.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is in itself a great shame.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">That needs no explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.</seg>
<seg id="25">It adds that the code was now added.</seg>

<seg id="2">Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms to the public education system.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.</seg>
<seg id="4">The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="5">Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.</seg>
<seg id="6">Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.</seg>
<seg id="8">This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trade between Russia & Iran surges 71% - RT Business</seg>
<seg id="2">With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has grown 70.9 percent in year-on-year terms, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been a surge in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies are resuming existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to get access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course, the further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and amounted to $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">The boost in trade was achieved by supplies of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzhagaryan is also expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel, to Iranian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I can personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">A robbery took place on Thursday evening in the drinks cash-and-carry of Rewe XXL on Walbröl's Gerberstraße.</seg>
<seg id="3">Three people dressed in dark clothing and with their faces covered brandished a gun and demanded that staff at the cash-and-carry hand over cash. They made a run for it on foot, and then probably got into a silver VW Golf.</seg>
<seg id="4">The police did not report how much money had been stolen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Between 1.6 and 1.7 m tall, the perpetrators were relatively short.</seg>
<seg id="6">The drinks cash-and-carry can be accessed directly from the Rewe supermarket's car park, and is tricky to observe.</seg>
<seg id="7">After the robbery, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße along Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and then fled, possibly towards the B 256 (Schladern ring road) in the silver car from the Schotterparkplatz opposite the entrance to the multi-storey car park.</seg>

<seg id="2">Children and young people from the youth work day group/social group work project from the child protection league of Nagold spent eight gloriously happy days with their social workers during the summer camp in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.</seg>
<seg id="3">The lively group spent the first week of the school holidays in the peacefully-located Hartwäldle holiday camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">There were several day trips on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="5">One trip saw the group head to Bretten to visit the petting zoo.</seg>
<seg id="6">Another saw them visit Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour around the world-famous cloisters.</seg>
<seg id="7">The third trip took the group to Pforzheim.</seg>
<seg id="8">The group learnt lots about how the Celts lived and what they ate in the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf.</seg>
<seg id="9">On warm dates, the group cooled off at the Tiefensee lake in Maulbronn: perfect for jumping into, swimming around in, and paddling.</seg>
<seg id="10">Children and carers cooked their own favourite meals, such as mini German spätzle dumplings in a sour sauce, traditional Seebronner Pfännle and Iselshauser Bloff, English breakfast, and Tübingen-style bolognese.</seg>
<seg id="11">During workshops, children could practise baktik, make beautiful jewellery with pearls and stones, or create a Roman windmill game from wood.</seg>
<seg id="12">Other highlights of the summer camp included fishing in a nearby pond, spending the evenings around a campfire, and the concluding "Gala Night".</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the chaplaincy of Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna went on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">They covered four stages together.</seg>
<seg id="4">The committee of upper ministrants for St. Anna had decided to prepare for and go on a pilgrimage lasting several days to bridge the gap to the next pilgrimage to Rome for all ministrants, likely to take place in two years' time.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage sites were discussed, and a decision was finally made to go to the bishop's city of Freiburg, where, to mark the holy year of mercy, this year the gates of mercy opened for this at Freiburg cathedral are a particular pilgrimage site.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 children from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set off.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the previous evening, Father Storost set the pilgrims off with a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims' cross and the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">They took the train from Horb to the starting point of Villingen, where the Cathedral of Our Lady is found. They started their pilgrimage from the cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day trips were framed by brief moments every morning and evening with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Even when they were out and about, the children took breaks at wayside crosses, chapels or churches to sing a song from the pilgrims' songbook they had put together themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The rectory of each parish they reached was available for them to stay in overnight.</seg>
<seg id="12">At each stage, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were responsible for creating a delicious, nourishing dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second day saw them head towards Gütenbach, via Furtwangen.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day, they set off on the section towards St. Peter, the most demanding section, seeing them climb around 500 metres in altitude in sweltering heat, and then descend again.</seg>
<seg id="15">They earned the reward of barbecueing together by the swimming pond.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning session on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive cloisters of St. Peter, they started off on the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">The children gathered together in Freiburg Cathedral late in the afternoon, visibly relieved and happy, and passed through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">A brief moment was taken to thank God.</seg>
<seg id="19">The evening mass in the cathedral saw the children who had arrived at the pilgrimage site welcomed by Chaplain Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristry and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day, there was time to look around the city, located in the region of Breisgau.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon they took the train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all the participants agreed that the trip was characterised by spirituality and a strong sense of camaraderie.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.</seg>
<seg id="4">Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.</seg>
<seg id="5">And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.</seg>
<seg id="6">The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel for gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There's no better way to win it.</seg>
<seg id="20">After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."</seg>
<seg id="24">We all as a team came together in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as Hoy's.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You get to win it with your mates.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="39">They finished in 3:51.943.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.</seg>
<seg id="46">There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.</seg>
<seg id="6">As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.</seg>
<seg id="24">And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Not just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall's on the cover of September's Vogue</seg>
<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of mother-manager Kris's Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of US Vogue's coveted September issue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, who is an Estee Lauder brand ambassador and has walked in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In a room with a bunch of people I love, looking at this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-esque?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favourite showbiz uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting about their sister's cover, only to end with the classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in an 8am timeslot), but Kris had to get her other girls in on this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because, with a spot on Vogue's September issue, we have surely entered a new era of Kardashian.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her to the cover of Vogue (she shared it with husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a league unto itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September Issue is Vogue's highest selling edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a thickness more closely resembling a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista counted 615 of last year's 832-page tome as advertising content).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that, in the past two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previous women to feature on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities."</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured in 2013, the year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But, even on the off-chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakout model" of her generation - falls into the former category, she is in pretty good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are legitimately talented women, excelling in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, not everyone is pleased about Jenner's success.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality television history, Jenner's position within the fashion world was always going to be fraught.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them the "bitches of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">This sentiment has boiled up again with the news of Jenner's Vogue cover appearance.</seg>
<seg id="23">But dwelling on the discontent seems beside the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">She is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She's walking for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She's selling you Estee Lauder foundation.</seg>
<seg id="28">She, and all of her sisters, are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective paywalled apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she photographed to LOVE magazine.</seg>
<seg id="30">And, in her downtime, possibly just as a way still to see sister Kourtney and her kids, she's on reality television.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.</seg>

<seg id="2">New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."</seg>
<seg id="5">The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="6">After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="8">The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="13">WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="14">A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ahead of the elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), considerable losses are looming for the governing parties of the SPD and the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="3">These are the findings of a representative poll carried out by INSA, a polling institute, on behalf of "Bild" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black ruling coalition in the north might just be able to continue in office, this will not be possible in Berlin, according to the poll.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the SPD was the strongest party in both states, with good chances of putting forward the head of the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD plummeted from 35.6 percent to 24 percent in five years.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the poll, this puts the party only slightly above the CDU, who had 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Left and the AfD will fight over third place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Left had 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), and, with 19 percent, the AfD could be in the regional parliament for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite small losses (from 8.7 percent to 6 percent), the Greens will return to Schwerin's regional parliament.</seg>
<seg id="11">The NPD and the FPD, with 3 percent each, will not be represented in the regional parliament.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the poll, the SPD would only receive 23 percent in Berlin's elections to the House of Representatives (2011 elections: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU would only take 18 percent, after having taken 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">This would put them behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left, with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would be represented in the House for the first time, with 14 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5 percent, the FPD could hope to return, but the Pirates, by contrast, would miss out - unlike in 2011.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone</seg>
<seg id="2">Email and the Internet in slow motion: The Nokia Communicator was brought to market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">Its successors have now conquered the world - but its manufacturer is in the midst of a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram, and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and larger, and harder to hold.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, it was quite bulky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The in-built storage originally held eight megabytes - enough today for around two high-resolution selfies.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, an iPhone holds at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was released for sale exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">The device is still available online for fans to buy for a couple of euros, even though it comes from the stone age of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, the Communicator sparked a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had presented the product a couple of months previously at the Cebit computer trade fair in Hanover, billing it as "the office you can fit in your pocket".</seg>
<seg id="13">The new mobile phone could really do a lot by standards back then: it could send and receive SMS messages and emails, and could even be contacted by fax.</seg>
<seg id="14">You could even access websites via a HTML browser, even though it was painfully slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">There was a calculator, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded open like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">This revealed a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was fairly high: 2700 deutschmarks, around 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 2015, the average sale price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros.</seg>
<seg id="20">In August 1996, nobody had any idea that the Communicator heralded the start of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Today, everything has changed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smartphones are a success story - even if the same cannot be said for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone branch of the Finnish company experienced an unprecedented disaster, and was eventually sold to Microsoft and wound up.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market is dominated by providers who came to the game much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">For many people today, being online all day, no matter where you are, is simply a fact of life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were around two billion smartphone users around the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple alone make up 555 million of them.</seg>
<seg id="28">Global sales of the devices amount to around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is in addition to the flourishing businesses of innumerable app providers and telecommunications firms.</seg>
<seg id="30">An entire industry has now sprung up around smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive moment when the mass market was broken into was only at the start of 2007, when the Apple CEO at the time, Steve Jobs, announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac World.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an internet communicator - and everything could be accessed easily via touchscreen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's triumphant march began, and the iPhone is still the company's most important product today.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who used to dominate the market, lost out.</seg>
<seg id="35">They eventually disappeared, and Blackberry had to fight for its existence.</seg>
<seg id="36">Apple, and Asian providers such as Samsung, now hold sway.</seg>
<seg id="37">20 years after their invention, smartphones are a fact of life.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nowadays, every German looks at their phone an average of 88 times a day.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all need to learn to put our phones down from time to time," said Janina Kugel, Siemens HR Director.</seg>
<seg id="40">Being permanently contactable has become a blessing and a curse.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat-and-mouse game" over ad blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to circumvent ad-blocking software amount to a "cat-and-mouse game," according to one of the companies that makes that software.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would be blocking ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their filters in its program to block ads on the social network once again.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook said that its desktop website would change the coding around its ads in order to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock now says it has gotten around the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this sort of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad-blocking community and circumventers has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible Facebook would come up with its own fix soon.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of just how big a concern ad blockers have become for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">Globally, roughly 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year from Pagefair and Adobe; nearly quadruple the number who used such software in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenue.</seg>
<seg id="10">The company is going after ad blockers on desktop however, because mobile ad blockers are not effective in Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Desktop ads still account for enough revenue that Facebook judged such a move to be worth the investment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would be updating its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were concerning because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.</seg>
<seg id="14">"This isn't a good experience for people and we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ad blockers are a blunt instrument, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.</seg>

<seg id="1">Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide</seg>
<seg id="2">The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.</seg>
<seg id="9">A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was it possible to avoid impact?</seg>
<seg id="12">That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="3">Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="6">To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="7">He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">These conditions are not currently met.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.</seg>
<seg id="11">We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.</seg>
<seg id="13">He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.</seg>

<seg id="2">Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.</seg>
<seg id="6">The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.</seg>
<seg id="11">Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">They're spinning as fast as they ever will.</seg>
<seg id="8">At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="1">A controversial baseball star steps down</seg>
<seg id="2">Alex Rodriguez' tears ran quicker than the US baseball star had run from base to base, in better days.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional announcement of retirement, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees jersey for the last time on 12 August, against the Tampa Bay Rays.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I'm saying goodbye to both of them," the 14-time All Star Major League Baseball (MLB) player explained.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="7">He signed a ten-year contract, which has brought him 27 million US dollars every year since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will work as a consultant and a youth coach - on full pay.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rodriguez paid this back in terms of playing performance long ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his team ("runs"), for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005, the Yankees, he has reached rather a few milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">Along with Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, there are only two other baseball players who can boast similar key statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the 41-year-old cannot be welcomed into the baseball Hall of Fame.</seg>
<seg id="13">Because no matter how successful Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the pitch, his behaviour off the pitch was just as controversial.</seg>
<seg id="14">As far back as 2009 the superstar told ESPN that he had taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013 he was banned for 211 games until the end of 2014 for his involvement in the "biogenesis scandal".</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez was the main suspect accused of having received performance enhancing drugs via an anti-ageing clinic in Florida over a period of years.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a legal battle, the ban was reduced to 162 matches.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The league might even have done me a favour in 2014 - I'd played for 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said, summing things up.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even his final days didn't go off without a bang.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends take to the great stage over their last few games, Rodriguez had to sit on the sidelines.</seg>
<seg id="21">"My job isn't about a retirement tour."</seg>
<seg id="22">"My job is about trying to win every game," stated Yankees coach Joe Girardi.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nevertheless, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and who has been rumoured to have been linked to pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, had the support of the fans of Yankees' arch rivals, Boston Red Sox.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We want A-Rod," the fans sang as they were defeated 4:9 by Rodriguez' team.</seg>

<seg id="1">2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Busted: After a sample tested positive for doping, weightlifter Adrian Zielinksi from Poland is not allowed to compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - the 2016 Olympic Games have been overshadowed by the first official cases of doping.</seg>
<seg id="4">One now-banned athlete had almost won a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first official doping cases of the Rio Olympic Games were announced ahead of the seventh day of the competition.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter hurdler Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive in Brazil, and have been excluded. Just before the start of the athletics competition, which has not escaped criticism, this news comes at a bad time.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Sunday before, Chen had revealed the presence of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used to mask drugs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The international sport tribunal CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time that she had been banned from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken fourth place in the 100m Butterfly final - missing out on a bronze medal by just 0.09 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chen was supposed to have taken part in the 50m Freestyle heats on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chen applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for a hearing and to have her B sample opened.</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association is taking the instance "very seriously, and asks that Chen cooperate fully with the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a press release: "We will collaborate with the international sports tribunal CAS and will accept their decision".</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the CAS, not the IOC, is responsible for sanctioning sportspeople who test positive.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also overnight in Rio, the news about Danekowa's positive test leaked out, and the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all of which were negative, and my fourth test was positive," which was "an unbelievable shock," she said to Bulgarian TV channel BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">She said she was innocent and that "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athlete explained.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, the banned substance involved was the blood doping chemical EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa was suspended as a precaution, and according to BNT, a B sample also tested postive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow spoke up immediately to criticise the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I do not understand why sportspeople do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been banned".</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost all the weightlifters from the nation, which has been plagued by doping, were not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was announced: the winner at the London Olympics in the weight category of up to 85 kg had tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier, just like his brother.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny taking it, but neither was allowed to compete in the weight category of up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ahead of the athletes' start, the case of Danekowa is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Federation IAAF had banned the entire Russian team, with one exception, for systematic doping, and running nation Kenya also created a mass of bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming, China's earlier offence had caused heated disputes between the athletes themselves.</seg>
<seg id="27">Camille Lacourt, from France, spoke out harshly against Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Sun Yang's pee is purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"When I look at the podium for the 200m Freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition, Sun was at the middle of an argument with Mack Horton, from Australia.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I have no time and no respect for drug cheats," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to sit out for a three-month ban.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data theft: This is how perfidiously hackers extort ransom money</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - with success.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany by Malwarebytes, the malware defence specialists, 40 percent of the companies surveyed had fallen victim to one, two, or several attacks involving extortion software in the past twelve months.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, around 20 percent of the companies had already been targeted by a ransomware attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid up the ransom demanded by the perpetrators so that they were able to use their systems and data that had been affected by the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Malwarebytes' observations, it is noticeable that perpetrators are tailoring their extortion software to attacks on corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful in that domain, the ransom money they can demand is significantly higher than it would be for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are currently seeing harmful software develop terrifyingly quickly," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski, in an interview with "Die Welt" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most malware programmes were still focused on sending out adverts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then perpetrators discovered extortion software.</seg>
<seg id="11">Private users were initially the target, but the shift to corporate attacks took place terrifyingly quickly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware follows a simple pattern: Once activated on a user's computer, it seeks out files that have not been edited for a long time, like Word, Excel or database files, as well as image and video archives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ransomware encrypts these files, and deletes the originals for good.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, the software presents the extortioner's demands.</seg>
<seg id="15">The victim has to transfer money - generally in the form of "Bitcoins", a cryptocurrency - to get the decryption code needed for the files.</seg>
<seg id="16">But while it's a personal photo database that's at play for private users, it's sensitive customer data or project databases needed for the continuation of projects that are the focus for companies.</seg>
<seg id="17">As a result, the damage from a ransomware hit is greater.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies affected reported that they had suffered a fall in turnover due to ransomware, 13 percent had to cease trading entirely, and in one instance, people's lives were put at risk.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already fallen victim to attacks, and their patients were placed under serious threat as a result of the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We always tell victims not to pay up: that simply exacerbates the problem," explains Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay up get their files back.</seg>
<seg id="22">Faced with operations coming to a standstill, it is hard for managers to say no to the perpetrators' demands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then again, the hackers know that, and do all they can to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">A recent study saw security researchers from F-Secure examine user interfaces and contact with extortioners. They came to the conclusion that perpetrators really do try to construct a kind of customer service system so that they can get more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat how to pay using Bitcoin, set up freely-accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And while private individuals are targeted for sums of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to bargain hard and pay out five-figure sums to get their files back decrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Faced with the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more and more professional, splitting up their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos: "An individual can write a ransomware program within about a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that three or four people will be involved.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware to the actual extortioners in the form of a set of software building blocks.</seg>
<seg id="30">Malware kits to date, including the malware itself, advice and additional tools, have been sold for a one-off fixed fee of between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"The kits include an adapter tool so that smaller configurations can be constructed, and the appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The extortioners then look out additional hackers to distribute the freshly prepared software between victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you just log into an underground forum, buy the set from a criminal, and task someone else with installing the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">There's a payment made for every computer infected.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Normally, criminals then task spammers with distribution," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">Now, many companies are aware of the risks of ransomware, and they are protecting their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies' IT specialists in Maywarebytes' survey relied on using file back-ups and scanner software to beat ransomware.</seg>
<seg id="39">As a result, perpetrators are already trying out new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"If simply encrypting files isn't enough of a threat to make an extortion request be granted, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive files instead, such as customer lists, or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes' CEO, Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the risk potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of file.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, perpetrators will be able to focus themselves on brand-new targets within the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could take control of a thermostat connected to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the midst of winter, many victims would pay a ransom to have their blocked heating turned back on.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the future, if hackers switch off an entire production line in a factory instead of someone's heating, ransomware could also be a issue in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">Something for every situation</seg>
<seg id="2">HONDA HR-V is practical and perfect for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">Honda wants to cram everything into the small HR-V: a bit of an SUV, a bit of a coupé, bundled up with the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">It seems a bit too much, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, does indeed prove itself to be exceptionally flexible in daily use.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V, at just 1.60m tall, seems small, passengers in the front and the back have got plenty of room, it's not a squeeze at all.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials used in the interior are well crafted, and have a pleasant appearance - just the surface of the dashboard lets the side down.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in terms of its loading space.</seg>
<seg id="8">There isn't just a boot of 453 l with the seats up, and 1026 l with the seats down; there are the "magic seats" too.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is rather less magical than it sounds: the seats in the back can be flipped up like cinema seats to reveal additional loading space, measuring 1.24 m from floor to ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot is easy to load, but the load height of 650 mm is a bit higher than it is in the Peugeot 2008, which is a comparable model.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6 l diesel engine we tested, with 88 kW/120 horsepower accelerates the HR-V powerfully, thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm across a wide range of speeds.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, it could certainly do its work a bit more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">Everyday consumption of 4.7 l/100 km was pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is an additional motor: a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW/130 horsepower.</seg>
<seg id="15">All-wheel drive is not available.</seg>
<seg id="16">Its handling is balanced, a good compromise between speed and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering could be a bit more direct, however.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the top-flight "Executive" version, which we tested, the fittings leave nothing to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include city emergency braking assistant (functions up to a speed of 32), collision warning system, and the lane departure warning system.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning system is irritating occasionally: when parking, it sees lots of obstacles as "approaching objects".</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant system is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed regulator reacts to traffic signage, and reduces the vehicle's speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, full connectivity is only available for the top-of-the-range model: 7 inch touchscreen, satnav, app integration, and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">There are two USB ports and a HDMI port under the armrest, which makes them rather tricky to access.</seg>
<seg id="25">It costs around 29,000 euros for a top-of-the-range diesel model, which is fair.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest quite that much, the petrol model is available from 20,000 euros, and diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The motors comply with euro 6 emissions standards.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda is offering a diverse car that is perfect for everyday driving.</seg>

<seg id="2">An airline will not be liable for a passenger's fall on a passenger boarding bridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is because liability only applies for risks typical for aviation travel, the Higher Regional Court of Dusseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).</seg>
<seg id="4">The claimant had broken a kneecap in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was one of the ordinary risks of life, pronounced the court.</seg>

<seg id="1">When do organisers pay if illness strikes?</seg>
<seg id="2">Travellers who fall ill will only get their money back when they return home if there is no doubt that their illness was caused by something within their hotel.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of visitors can be proved to have suffered the same symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this case, a family were stricken with diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their holiday in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="5">They spent almost all their holiday in their room.</seg>
<seg id="6">The holidaymakers blamed a malfunctioning sewage treatment plant, which they believed to have polluted the seawater.</seg>
<seg id="7">The family took the opinion that the holiday was unsatisfactory - and took the organiser to court.</seg>
<seg id="8">The claimants had no luck in court.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was true that the waste treatment plant was suffering from a fault.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the organiser only found out about this just before the claimants departed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Until that date, the organiser had to assume that the seawater was acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the judgement, the organiser had not violated its information obligation.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, no contamination was found in water samples.</seg>

<seg id="1">De Maizière said that many people were worried about further attacks following the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July.</seg>
<seg id="2">He said that the state must react to the threat of terrorism with prudence and resolve.</seg>
<seg id="3">One thing is for sure: Our country will not react to the perpetrators' violence with hatred and division.</seg>
<seg id="4">We will not give the terrorists this victory.</seg>
<seg id="5">If perpetrators have to leave the country quicker, that will boost security and increase the general public's approval of refugee politics.</seg>
<seg id="6">De Maizière wants the proposals to be implemented before the federal elections in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also announced that security services would receive more staff, to the tune of "a mid-four figure sum over several years".</seg>
<seg id="8">Advertising for terrorism must be punishable once again.</seg>
<seg id="9">Video surveillance is to be improved, and gun laws to be amended so that purchasing weapons online, in particular, is made more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="10">Doctors' confidentiality obligations, recently the subject of much discussion, are to remain, according to De Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, he wants to talk to doctors to find solutions to reduce the risk to the general public with regard to mental illness, he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Minister felt that improved social care was important to counteract the radicalisation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="13">Teachers must be better trained for dealing with traumatised individuals.</seg>
<seg id="14">De Maizière is planning to employ undercover agents to hunt down criminals in particular areas of the Internet (the Dark Web).</seg>
<seg id="15">SPD Head Gabriel said that "the SPD is prepared to discuss anything that will increase security further".</seg>
<seg id="16">He said it was important that the Minister of the Interior had spoken out clearly against actionism.</seg>
<seg id="17">"That was a slap in the face for agitators in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel on Friday to the newspapers of the Funke media group.</seg>
<seg id="18">De Maizière had previously turned down calls from the coalition for a burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better flow of traffic on the motorway slip road</seg>
<seg id="2">Traffic jams are a regular occurrence on the bypass - here's a photo from November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But that is about to change: the right-hand turning lane is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all drivers stuck in rush-hour traffic on the bypass every evening as they drive onto the motorway slip road (A43).</seg>
<seg id="5">Next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August), the State Roadworks Office will extendthe right-hand turning lane in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit from Weseler Straße by 700 metres.</seg>
<seg id="6">This means that drivers will be able to feed in directly from Hammer Straße.</seg>
<seg id="7">The major advantage is that traffic will split earlier, improving overall circulation on the busy section of main road 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The CDU fraction in the Münster (West) district administration came up with the idea to lengthen the exit.</seg>
<seg id="9">The traffic on the slip road is particularly bad for drivers between 5pm and 7pm.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the traffic jam stretches to the bridge over Albersloher Weg - and sometimes even goes over it.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is caused by the bottleneck on the B51, just before the exit onto Weseler Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, there is only a single lane of traffic over the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second lane was removed a good eighteen months ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason for this was that structural analysis had shown that the bridge was no longer capable of supporting the weight caused by two lanes, particularly the weight of heavy goods vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="15">The relevant authorities cannot say how long this bottleneck, and the associated rush-hour traffic, will last.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's going to be a matter of years: officially, the bridge will remain in use until 2034.</seg>
<seg id="17">The district authorities deliberately chose the less busy period of the school holidays for the extension of the right-hand turning lane, because it will cause delays.</seg>
<seg id="18">Traffic will be diverted past the construction site in a single lane on Tuesday and Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="3">The "Nima's" association and Young Theatre are now planning a musical project.</seg>
<seg id="4">The "Nima's" association enables young people from a migrant or refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="5">The "International Class" at the Kinderhaus forest school saw a performance of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" at the Young Theatre in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="6">Within the framework of the "Intercultural Journey" set up by Nima's, 19 pupils aged between 11 and 15 saw the play in the small house.</seg>
<seg id="7">The association's objective is to encourage cultural integration of young people from migrant and refugee backgrounds, and since the start of the year, it has offered schools with welcome classes with the chance to attend cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most young people in the class arrived in Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thanks to the choreography, scenic images and video animations they were able to follow the plot regardless, according to the press release from Münster's Young Theatre.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theatre, will work on a musical theatre project together over the next season.</seg>
<seg id="11">From October to December, young people aged between 14 and 20 with and without a migrant and refugee background will have the chance to attend professionally-led courses for singing, dancing, acting, and music.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are also plans for acting and theatrical language training for children and families.</seg>

<seg id="1">Silent night: Tips to fight sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening your mind won't stop whirring, you lie awake for hours each night, and by the time morning comes, sleep is far from your mind even well before your alarm goes off.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">If you suffer from these issues, you're in good company: According to the Robert Koch Institute, around a quarter of adults suffer from sleep disorders, and more than ten percent find that they often or always wake up not feeling refreshed.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are various forms of sleep disorders, and they can have many causes, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, President of the German Association for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What people generally understand by sleep disorders is insomnia: a problem with falling asleep and sleeping through the night.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people feel that their sleep throughout the night is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the Board of the German Association of General Practicioners, who practices in Varel in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Biological, psychological or behavioural factors can be to blame, along with medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">A sleep disorder is often a reflection of another illness.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Waking up very early is common with depression, in particular," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be the case that several factors have an impact on each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">If you have a slipped disk, for example, you might find it hard to lie down, wake up every couple of hours, and start to grumble about everyday problems and worries, suggests Weeß as an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">That causes tension, and it is impossible to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you see your doctor about sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">If, over the course of a month, you sleep poorly for at least three nights a week, and find that this impacts you during the day, you should see a doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">They can impact in various different ways: You could be exhausted, tired, poorly rested, suffer from difficulties concentrating and staying alert, be irritable, have mood swings or physical complains such as stomach ache or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To be able to treat a sleep disorder, it is important to work out what is causing it.</seg>
<seg id="21">Behaviour changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - with traditional sleeping tablets only being used in exceptional circumstances and for a maximum of two weeks - are all options for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are hardly any registered sleep doctors in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Sleep Medicine at the Charité University Medicine Centre in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">As a result, you should first turn to your GP if you're suffering with a sleep disorder, recommends Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">Your doctor will examine you to see if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to a sleep lab, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">Doctors recommend an examination in a sleep lab for patients whose snoring disrupts their breathing, for people who feel abnormally sleepy during the day, for sleepwalkers, or if the cause of a sleep disorder cannot be pinpointed, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination at all.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Just - please don't take an afternoon nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After being cabled up, you head to bed at your normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nasal cannula, a belt across your chest and a sensor on your finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera mounted on the ceiling records the sleeper.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems they are experiencing?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are a fair few areas that can be adjusted to encourage a better night's sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß lists them: going to bed and getting up a regular times, not staying in bed too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching television to get to sleep, avoiding alcohol, and not looking at the clock during the night - because then you start working out times straight away, and that's not helpful at all.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has posted on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014 he got his first gold medal at the Short Course Swimming Championships in Doha, while setting his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has come forward on Facebook to defend his ex-teammates from criticism.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In a country in which an Olympic champion is awarded 20,000 euros and the King of the Jungle gets 150,000 euros, nobody should wonder why medals aren't being won," the 26-year-old wrote on Thursday night on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="6">The remuneration system in swimming is poor, but doping tests, on the other hand, are very good, he says.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means that we cannot compete with countries who pay a lot and that don't pay as much attention to doping, or even encourage it.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I'm not saying that we should stop our tests," he went on to explain.</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to register with the National Anti-Doping Agency for Germany (NADA) nine months before he started.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly how it should be with countries.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a couple of little linden trees, and a few cobblestones among them: at first glance, Berlin-Friedrichshain's Rigaer Straße doesn't look as if it's one of the streets that the police consider to be among the most dangerous in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you walk along the street from east to west, you come across playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health-food shop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone has spraypainted "horrid!" on the facade of a house.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, due to be pulled down soon, construction is already underway: by 2017, a building with large windows and 133 new apartments to rend is expected to be constructed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles on this "trendy district", as the property company responsible has dubbed Friedrichshain, have been illustrated with pictures of burning cars over the past few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason for this is house 94: At first, it was occupied by squatters, then the inhabitants had rental contracts, but some rooms on the ground floor are still occupied by squatters and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Berlin's Senator of the Interior Henkel had called multiple times since the start of the year for the police to take a hard line against the project that has made the area a "no-go zone" for police and singled out 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared on 22 June by 300 police officers, the police patrolled the area for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three vans, closing parts of the street and preventing visitors from accessing house 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">During this period, builders renovated the rooms on behalf of the unidentified owner of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July Berlin's Administrative Court ruled that the clearing was illegal, and, one day later, police and builders left the site, to the cheers of supporters and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the street seemed peaceful: parents were out walking with their children, people were sitting on their houses' steps in the sunshine, other people were chatting in front of the off-licence.</seg>
<seg id="12">Near the house project there is a primary school and a kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Far-left violence is not what worries most residents the most: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the district since 1999, and Jana*, who has brought three children up here, are mainly irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">They share the inhabitants of the housing project's fears of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a district that wants more police protection against left-wing vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="16">The schisms that Berlin's Senator for the Interior and the police believe to have opened up between the squatters in the house and their neighbours do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain, in the east of Berlin, was traditionally a working-class neighbourhood. Even today, it has a lower average income and a higher risk of poverty than the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Squatters in houses and the residential projects they spawn are nothing new in the district: in 1990 numerous houses in the then-GDR were full of squatters, including almost all of Mainzer Straßer, near Rigauer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While those on Mainzerstraße were cleared out during a real street battle with a large police deployment, many of the projects in Rigauer were legalised, and are to a certain extent still inhabited by the people who first squatted there 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become more and more of a magnet for tourists and Berlin residents who come from all over the world: residents from GDR times and former squatters are now sharing their district with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This can be felt in the rents, which have climbed by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in Rigauer are seen as symbols of this development: this is clear from their broken windows or freshly painted facades splattered by paint bombs.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street has been mentioned so often this year in connection with "autonomous left-wing violence".</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours seeing this as a problem could be that they are not directly affected by crime: according to statistics, almost all crimes such as bodily harm are directed against the police.</seg>
<seg id="25">The majority of crimes are damage to property, which tend to target new buildings and recently renovated properties.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a block of flats next-door to controversial number 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">She is calm about acts of violence: the people at number 94 are her neighbours, they certainly had nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the notorious burning cars have not played a role in Rigaer for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="29">The trained architect does not see her street as a crime flashpoint - quite the opposite: "Here we help each other, live together along the street, and talk to each other more than elsewhere".</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer chose to move to Rigauer Straße - and she chose to stay there.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is also why it was so important to her that residents got their street back: back from the police, politicians and the media who suddenly started claiming how important the district was in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street is still being taken away: by impersonal new developments in old empty sites, which drive out old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"They are freehold flats, and most people here aren't interested in that - people here generally aren't so well-off," she said.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I absolutely cannot condone violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do when nobody listens to you?</seg>
<seg id="36">Then everyone gets frustrated, including the police and residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for people who have moved in and are irritated by paint bombs: The housing project and the left-wing scene are part of the district.</seg>
<seg id="38">If you move here, you should be aware of that - just like someone who moves into an area full of pubs should know they can't really complain about the noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All people only described using their forenames have requested that their real names are not used</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deutscle is the new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deutschle is the contact person for integration and organisation.</seg>
<seg id="3">She will also work on-site as a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social education worker will assist the management team run by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She views herself as a point-of-contact for all involved: refugees, people from the working group for refugees, administrators, authorities, and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Kunde from the working group said that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now available to work as a jack-of-all-trades to help anyone experiencing difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's what some people said when management posted the advert for the job - meaning it less in a mocking way, and more with reference to the number of tasks that were to be performed.</seg>
<seg id="9">They were looking for a manager with people skills and communication skills, combined with years of experience in social work - a real jack-of-all-trades.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, managerial work is not how she spends most of her time, Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is primarily about organisation, working on-site with people, even in the background, and networking, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been in post for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She has taken the 50% job for a fixed term of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was high time," Regine Kunde said, that Annika Deuschle offered support to voluntary and full-time workers.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are major problems, minor problems, organisational problems, problems with people, comprehension problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be located in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">For a while, one major problem has been finding homes subsequently for refugees that have been given certified status.</seg>
<seg id="18">Communes themselves are responsible for subsequent accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to house the refugees in their own properties or in rented properties.</seg>
<seg id="20">Communes themselves have to bear the costs for constructing, renting or renovating this accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility switches from district administration to communes and job centres.</seg>
<seg id="22">The problem: Properties are free, but not every landlord is prepared to let.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for a while.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration cannot find any private homes.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to Deuschle, being reliant on private homes has not worked.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is why the commune's homes need to be beefed up, as it is so neatly put.</seg>
<seg id="27">Consequently new containers will soon be located in Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But homes alone will not do the trick.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the key word, and Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree on that score.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed abode, internships, apprenticeships, school places, "one-euro" traineeship jobs and temporary jobs need to be found or set up for refugees and migrants.</seg>
<seg id="31">"More jobs would be good," reports Regine Kunde.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many people work in builder's yards or help caretakers, or do voluntary work - and that provides motivation in a very orderly way, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for the community leads to a positive public perception.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is not "employment therapy".</seg>
<seg id="35">Being active doesn't just mean working.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, Deuschle and Kunde say.</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">Consequently there is a need to provide sports, contact to locals, and, above all, language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">There is where the administration and volunteers can get involved.</seg>
<seg id="41">She says it is key that refugees feel as if they are wanted and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The length of time that processes take is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to refugees that it will take that long, and that the time can be filled productively - for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">If someone feels that they can't help anyone in Urbach, that they aren't allowed to work, and that they are useless, they'll never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority are motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problem cases, Kunde says honestly, "people for whom nothing works". As a result, Deuschle and Kunde's work will always be to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All told, this is "a mammoth task".</seg>
<seg id="48">A tricky question: After recent events, are the two women worried about radicalisation, even in a small commune like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"No," Regine Kunde said clearly, "which some people might call naive". She could not and did not want to ignore the chance of a residual risk remaining.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, volunteers are already aware of this.</seg>
<seg id="51">These issues are already discussed by the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the attackers would bring them into total disrepute.</seg>
<seg id="53">"They want to show they have nothing to do with it," Regine Kunde said.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many of them would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So full-time and volunteer staff have to keep an eye open for jobs in the town and across the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">But they always have in the back of their mind that a new group of refugees and migrants could soon be arriving in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">Politicians shy away from answering this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is unfair to show them volunteers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"In Urbach we've not got to where we wanted to be quite yet," said Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">The situation would ease a bit if they did not receive any new refugees.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Kunde also makes clear that the residents of Urbach have their hands full with integrating the refugees who have arrived to date.</seg>
<seg id="63">Currently they amount to around 100 people, predominantly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, you've got to help them - and both women agree on that.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated that there are no easy answers to be found there.</seg>
