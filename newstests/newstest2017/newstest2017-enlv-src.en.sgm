<seg id="2">A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."</seg>
<seg id="4">The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."</seg>
<seg id="11">"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.</seg>
<seg id="12">Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.</seg>
<seg id="13">He was a kind spirit with a big heart.</seg>
<seg id="14">His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was the brother that went with the flow.</seg>
<seg id="17">"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.</seg>
<seg id="12">He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.</seg>
<seg id="13">Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.</seg>
<seg id="8">I lost count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russian public opinion has also turned since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He's denied that emphatically.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could claim a victory of sorts.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is also an economic motive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has slumped by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.</seg>
<seg id="33">They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.</seg>
<seg id="38">Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="40">Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.</seg>
<seg id="42">Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.</seg>
<seg id="45">Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland</seg>
<seg id="2">The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="3">Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.</seg>
<seg id="6">During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.</seg>
<seg id="9">Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins</seg>
<seg id="3">Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I'm very emotional because my family are here as well</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm relieved and very humble.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.</seg>
<seg id="18">I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.</seg>
<seg id="20">He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has been a rollercoaster ride.</seg>
<seg id="24">Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.</seg>
<seg id="26">And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.</seg>
<seg id="5">A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).</seg>
<seg id="10">On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiles convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a move that has mystified Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">No-one knows yet.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="30">But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.</seg>
<seg id="10">We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.</seg>
<seg id="14">On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Happily, it all went very well.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all of it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on vault.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jaw-dropping on floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant all over.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now, finally, an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.</seg>
<seg id="15">The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.</seg>
<seg id="21">While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.</seg>
<seg id="22">A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.</seg>
<seg id="26">Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.</seg>
<seg id="27">Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.</seg>
<seg id="28">She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.</seg>
<seg id="32">She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:</seg>

<seg id="2">Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.</seg>
<seg id="3">The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.</seg>
<seg id="6">I just can't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="7">The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.</seg>
<seg id="8">Family tells the station he is expected to recover.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.</seg>
<seg id="10">Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.</seg>
<seg id="14">The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.</seg>
<seg id="16">Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team looks, finally, like America.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is powerful.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.</seg>
<seg id="14">And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.</seg>
<seg id="19">Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="29">To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."</seg>
<seg id="6">With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="1">The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat</seg>
<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.</seg>

<seg id="1">PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish</seg>
<seg id="2">Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are</seg>
<seg id="20">His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.</seg>
<seg id="27">Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.</seg>
<seg id="29">Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.</seg>
<seg id="39">Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.</seg>

<seg id="2">Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.</seg>
<seg id="4">So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid</seg>
<seg id="6">Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.</seg>
<seg id="7">U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.</seg>
<seg id="8">And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.</seg>
<seg id="9">'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.</seg>
<seg id="10">'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.</seg>
<seg id="12">Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.</seg>
<seg id="13">And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.</seg>
<seg id="14">Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor</seg>
<seg id="15">Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.</seg>
<seg id="16">Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'</seg>
<seg id="17">Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes</seg>
<seg id="18">Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest</seg>
<seg id="19">Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks</seg>
<seg id="20">One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'</seg>
<seg id="21">Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.</seg>

<seg id="2">Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday</seg>
<seg id="3">Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.</seg>
<seg id="4">Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.</seg>
<seg id="5">MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thanks for that.</seg>
<seg id="8">Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.</seg>
<seg id="9">Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used</seg>
<seg id="10">Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????</seg>
<seg id="11">The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'</seg>
<seg id="12">Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'</seg>
<seg id="13">Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out</seg>
<seg id="14">Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being</seg>
<seg id="15">Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.</seg>
<seg id="16">You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.</seg>
<seg id="17">Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'</seg>
<seg id="18">It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'</seg>
<seg id="19">CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark</seg>
<seg id="20">Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf</seg>
<seg id="21">CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments</seg>
<seg id="22">The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.</seg>
<seg id="23">We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.</seg>
<seg id="24">We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.</seg>
<seg id="25">To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.</seg>
<seg id="26">That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.</seg>
<seg id="28">'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'</seg>
<seg id="29">'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'</seg>
<seg id="30">'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'</seg>

<seg id="2">Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.</seg>
<seg id="3">To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.</seg>
<seg id="4">She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.</seg>

<seg id="6">A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'</seg>
<seg id="7">She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'</seg>
<seg id="8">Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.</seg>

<seg id="10">'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'</seg>

<seg id="12">'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'</seg>

<seg id="1">How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga</seg>
<seg id="2">It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.</seg>
<seg id="5">If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.</seg>
<seg id="6">You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds tricky?</seg>
<seg id="11">Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.</seg>
<seg id="12">But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.</seg>

<seg id="2">A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">This family are notorious and their name is notorious.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished</seg>
<seg id="14">Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.</seg>
<seg id="17">The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="21">'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'</seg>
<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction</seg>
<seg id="33">Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Mayor of Cannes, the southern France sea resort, has prohibited wearing burkini swimsuits, which almost completely cover the woman's body and resemble a wetsuit, on the beaches of the city, local officials announced on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">David Linard, the Mayor of Cannes, has signed an order that "persons, who have no swimsuit honoring good customs and secularism, are prohibited to access beaches and swimming areas" as the basic principle of the Republic of France.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The swimsuit, which displays religious affiliation in times when France and religious venues are the target of terrorist attacks may put public order at risk (stampedes, clashes etc.), and it is necessary to prevent that," the ordinance says.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We are not speaking of prohibition of wearing religious symbols on the beach, but of pretentious clothing which is associated with devotion to terrorist movements waging a war against us," the manager of the local government's utility services, Thierry Miguel, explained.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that burkini swimsuits on the beaches of Cannes haven't been seen since July 28 when Linard, a member of the center-right party the Republicans, signed this ordinance and it came into force.</seg>
<seg id="7">This week, a water amusement park in Marseille cancelled a scheduled private event for Muslim women who would be wearing burkini suits, because politicians from both right wing and left wing political parties were outraged at such possibility.</seg>
<seg id="8">In France it is prohibited to wear Muslim women's head-gear covering the person's face, yet religious symbols or clothing items are not prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="9">85 people were killed in Nice, a resort close to Cannes, on July 14 in a terrorist attack, the responsibility for which was undertaken by the group Islamic State.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">In Thursday evening, August 11, one of the last summer festivals, Kubana, was launched and it continues until Sunday night.</seg>
<seg id="2">The first evening visitors were pampered with such bands as "Enter Shikari" from Great Britain, which was expected to come last year but it quietly disappeared from the program, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from "The Prodigy" and others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also the next festival days can boast with noteworthy names - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", drummer Marky Ramone from punk rock legend "Ramones" with his band "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with Belorussian punk rock leader Sergey Mikhalok, the popular Georgian actor and singer Vakhtang Kikabidze, Ukraine's "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and many more; look here for the complete event program.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Kubana festival is taking place in Latvia for the second year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last year it suffered financial failure and huge losses, but it did not keep the organizers away from another try: they added a phonetic length mark in the festival's name, also included a Latvian band in the program ("All Day Long" will appear on stage in the evening at 19:15) and announced that from now on the festival has become "[...] closer and obtained a local feel alongside such symbols of Riga as its skyline and cats."</seg>
<seg id="6">It is too early to judge whether their efforts justify themselves, because the festival has just started, but during the first evening "Delfi entertainment" observed that so far the festival hasn't managed to attract large crowds and the number of visitors was similar to that of the last year.</seg>

<seg id="1">The President who avoided the spotlight: 145th anniversary of Gustavs Zemgals</seg>
<seg id="2">On Friday, August 12, we commemorate 145 years since the birth of Gustavs Zemgals, the second President of Latvia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Zemgals was among those who declared the statehood of Latvia but later remained undeservedly overshadowed by the oft-mentioned first President of Latvia, Janis Cakste, as well as the last pre-war period President, Karlis Ulmanis.</seg>
<seg id="4">No other politician has defended democracy and the rule of law as did Zemgals, Arnolds Auzins writes in his book about Gustavs Zemgals that was published a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">In conversation with "Delfi", Auzins notes that Zemgals was one of the few high-ranking politicians endowed with a good sense of humor.</seg>
<seg id="6">By comparison, others appear quite stiff and concerned about "correctness".</seg>
<seg id="7">Zemgals knew how to be different and nowadays we might draw a parallel to Raimonds Vejonis.</seg>
<seg id="8">"He was a person who didn't lose touch with the nation," Auzins says.</seg>
<seg id="9">Today's politicians' knowledge of history is lacking: they refer to Karlis Ulmanis as the good leader, but very few seem to know about his hot-headed personality.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only person at whom Ulmanis did not yell during government meetings was General Janis Balodis.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if Ulmanis is all smiles and kindness in photos, he in fact displayed some "hysterical" traits.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Zemgals, with his sense of humor and democratic personality leaves the exactly opposite impression," explains Auzins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Professor Aivars Stranga from the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, in a conversation with "Delfi", agrees with Auzins' evaluation of Zemgals as a calm and level-headed statesman.</seg>
<seg id="14">Stranga also notes that Zemgals has stood out from the crowd with a respectful attitude towards minorities and quite frequently invited members of the Jewish community to visit the Presidential Palace.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This had not been a common practice, and after Zemgals' presidency, this tradition was continued by Alberts Kviesis," the historian tells.</seg>
<seg id="16">[Zemgals] was a quiet and even-tempered as a person, so it took quite a long time to convince him to become the president.</seg>
<seg id="17">It wasn't really his aspiration, nor did he crave fame.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was also a rather harsh critic of himself because he did not speak French, what he believed was a must for the country's president.</seg>
<seg id="19">"He did however learn basic French during his presidency," Stranga adds.</seg>
<seg id="20">Zemgals could not be convinced to run for another term, and he didn't saw high-ranking positions as a suitable pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="21">But by all means, he remains a very respected personality in the history of Latvia and had held an esteemed job even before becoming president, namely as a highly-demanded notary public.</seg>
<seg id="22">Zemgals also headed the famous Zemgals cash-office at number 3 Suvorova Street, where a savings brokers and credit-savings association was located; it was there the Republic of Latvia was actually created in discussions among the founding fathers.</seg>
<seg id="23">His views were unremittingly progressive.</seg>
<seg id="24">Not a huge admirer of Ulmanis, he however did not argue against him publicly.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Nevertheless, he occasionally revealed in private conversations his discontent with Ulmanis' course of actions," Stranga points out.</seg>
<seg id="26">He led a peaceful life, and there are no suspicions whatsoever about involvement in illegal issues or corruption.</seg>
<seg id="27">How is Zemgals remembered today?</seg>
<seg id="28">Unfortunately, many people only know the Riga street named after Zemgals.</seg>
<seg id="29">He was committed to democratic views and held a generally centrist beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="30">"There were no large turmoils during his time in office, namely, he could be associated with a truly stable presidency," Stranga sums up.</seg>
<seg id="31">During Gustavs Zemgals' presidency, from 1927 to 1930, a state visit to Sweden took place, which for Latvia additionally reconfirmed the recognition of its sovereignty by the neighboring country as well as having been accepted into the community of the Northern European democratic nations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Zemgals' state visit to Stockholm started on May 28, 1929.</seg>
<seg id="33">The return visit of Gustaf V, the King of Sweden, took place on June 29, 1929.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second President of Latvia was born in 1871 and passed away in January 1939.</seg>

<seg id="1">Simple ways that help dealing with kids' tantrums.</seg>
<seg id="2">I often face situations where parents view their child's tantrums as something wrong and abnormal.</seg>
<seg id="3">When a child openly expresses anger, we don't know how to react, psychologist Jekaterina Kesa told Econet.</seg>
<seg id="4">The specialist also recommends a discussion on these natural human feelings, anger and rage, which are occasionally experienced by every one of us.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, aggression is a physical act against another person and it usually happens in anger.</seg>
<seg id="6">When we adults feel angry or worried, we usually know what's happening to us and how to handle it.</seg>
<seg id="7">We can do the following with our anger or rage: express, suppress, hide, keep inside, tell our friends or loved ones about it, we can kick the sofa in anger, smoke a cigarette (not the best way to dispel anger!), take a shower, bang our fist on the table or do other things we don't normally do.</seg>
<seg id="8">We know how to not direct our aggression towards others, because we have other ways of dealing with these emotions.</seg>
<seg id="9">When children become angry, they do not understand what is happening to them, how to name it and how to handle it over a period of time.</seg>
<seg id="10">They might say: "Go away!", "You're stupid", "Bad mommy", "I hate you", "I'm your friend any more" - and only rarely are they capable of saying "I am angry at you".</seg>
<seg id="11">Children's perceptions are quite direct and literal: they are completely here and now, they are spontaneous and authentic in expressing their feelings and often they are held captive by their various emotions.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is very important for parents not to prohibit a child to express his or her emotions, including anger, not to blame and shame them; instead, they need to help the child.</seg>

<seg id="1">Do relationships need a pause?</seg>
<seg id="2">A long working day in which not everything has gone smoothly, or you just simply are having a bad mood: there are plenty of reasons why you'd want to "disconnect" from the entire world for a moment, a day or even longer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Can one also take a break in relationships and have a good rest?</seg>
<seg id="4">Or perhaps it means that teammates have to go separate ways?</seg>
<seg id="5">Men of various ages shared their opinions on that.</seg>
<seg id="6">Janis (23) makes his point succinctly: "I believe that if a break is needed in a relationship you're just not with the right person."</seg>
<seg id="7">Meanwhile, Eduards (30) has discovered a method which could possibly help some of you.</seg>
<seg id="8">If you feel that a partner is getting on your nerves due to every minute issue, it is definitely the right time to start looking around in order to understand, whether you miss him or her or, perhaps, you don't think much about of them or even do not want to see them ever again.</seg>
<seg id="9">So, the answer is : yes, a pause can help to save time and understand how important the other person is to you.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.</seg>
<seg id="11">In my opinion, there must be breaks in relationships opposing the routine, because if you're with someone 24/7, some arguments are inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="12">They are triggered by the fact that you see every tiny detail of the partner's activities and it starts getting on your nerves.</seg>
<seg id="13">People grow tired of each other, especially if they don't have anything else to talk about apart from what you've done during the day.</seg>
<seg id="14">I am judging from my personal experience and it is the reason none of my relationships lasted for more than a few months.</seg>
<seg id="15">If at some moment you think that it could be better somewhere else or with someone else, why would this woman, with whom you are together, deserve a person like you, who is able to think that it is not good enough here and somewhere there, behind the mountains, the grass is certainly greener?</seg>
<seg id="16">Such thinking is almost a petty form of cheating.</seg>
<seg id="17">If it does not work, it is not worth trying.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I practice it, therefore I somewhat condemn those who do not," says Edmunds (46).</seg>
<seg id="19">Karlis (33) has a completely opposite view.</seg>
<seg id="20">I think that everybody needs a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">You cannot just sit and look into your partner's eyes every day, from morning till evening and rejoice at never-ending love.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wake up!</seg>
<seg id="23">There are so many things around us: friends, work, partying.</seg>
<seg id="24">Everything has its proper time.</seg>
<seg id="25">Of course, also for your girlfriend or wife, but if both partners are able to keep that balance between family life and the rest of the world, then one can have the "happily ever after".</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the only way.</seg>
<seg id="27">Martins (27) says: "It is hard to say whether one needs or does not need a break, but one thing is clear: for the person who requests the "break" something is certainly missing in the relationship."</seg>
<seg id="28">If this idea arises, one must look for changes in the nearest future, be they to good or bad, and it depends on the persons involved.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think that breaks are useful when you're young and crazy, be it all the time if needed, but later when it gets serious and relationships enter another phase, you cannot have any "restful pauses".</seg>
<seg id="30">You are making a decision to spend the rest of your lives together!</seg>
<seg id="31">"If you cannot stand each other's company and need a break every now and then, what will happen when you retire as seniors spending their time commenting on cats' behavior or what's the best day to weed the garden," Kristaps (19) explains.</seg>

<seg id="4">The exhibition opened on August 12 and since August 13 it is available for visitors and will run until October 30.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Latvian National Museum of Art with a wide retrospection in the recently opened Great Exhibition Hall honors the painter Janis Rozentals (1866 - 1916) whose 115th birthday is mentioned internationally in UNESCO's Calendar of Events.</seg>
<seg id="6">The retrospective, with more than 150 works of art, is one of the central events of the program for Janis Rozentals' anniversary year.</seg>
<seg id="7">A selection of art works is mainly created from the museum collection which convincingly represents the main periods, genres, stylistic variability and diversity of the techniques of the classic's creative life.</seg>
<seg id="8">The show is supplemented with exhibits from Akseli Gallen-Kallela Museum, the Museum of Literature and Music, the Liepaja Museum, the Tukums Museum and several private collections based in Latvia and Finland.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mood of the turn of the century is revived with the presence of photos; the mobile app of the exhibition reveals a correlation between several art works and photos, which were taken by the painter for the needs of his creative work with his own camera.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Rozentals Society "Rozentals-seura" promoting friendly relationships between Finland and Latvia and named after the Latvian classic, in its turn offers the first stop of a small informative traveling exhibition "With a view to Finland, with a heart in Latvia" at the Latvian National Museum of Art.</seg>

<seg id="2">The combatants for the Islamic State fleeing from Manbij, Aleppo Governorate in Syria, have captured about 2,000 civilians who are being used as human shields, the US-supported Kurdish and Arab alliance and observers reported on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We did not shoot at them, because they took civilians with them when fleeing to Jarabulus," press officer of the Kurdish Manbij Military Council announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two months of clashes, the Democratic Forces of Syria (QSD) led by Kurds, which is a US-supported Kurdish/Arabic alliance in the north of Syria, announced on Friday that Manbij has been freed from jihadists.</seg>

<seg id="7">I want to emphasize that the construction works that were planned within the framework of the project, have been completely finished at the stipulated deadlines and at the planned level.</seg>

<seg id="1">German researchers discuss the number of "Berlin Wall deaths".</seg>
<seg id="2">According to a new study, the number of fatalities at the border of former Eastern Germany, greatly subdued by the Communist regime, could be considerably larger than so far believed, but doubts about the actual number of victims have not been cleared yet.</seg>
<seg id="3">The data publicized by the Berlin Wall museum Checkpoint Charlie on Wednesday show evidence that from 1945 to 1989 the Communist authorities killed 1841 persons trying to escape the territory under their control across its border with the Western allies-controlled territory and later West Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">The museum has spent years researching the deaths related to the border, and it occasionally updates the number of victims.</seg>
<seg id="5">Another 11 fatalities were added to the list this year, including a six year old boy who drowned when his family tried to get to Western Germany through former Czechoslovakia and Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="6">Soviet Army deserters are also included in a new group of Berlin Wall victims.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The scale of total damage, caused by the double evil of Communism and Socialism has not been fully documented," director of the museum, Alexandra Hildebrandt, admits.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Our task is to make sure that the graves of those who died trying to escape the Communist-controlled country would be maintained and not lost", emphasizes Hildebrandt in her public report.</seg>
<seg id="9">But other researchers have already contested the new numbers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The number of 1841 is unconvincing," the East Germany history expert Johann Stadt from the Free University of Berlin stated in an interview to Süddeutsche Zeitung.</seg>
<seg id="11">Together with other researchers of the Free University of Berlin, he currently reviews other alleged suspicious fatalities near the border and so far they have managed confirm only 260 cases.</seg>
<seg id="12">Previously researchers assumed that the Communists had killed 138 persons at the Berlin Wall.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stadt believes that if one counts those who have died when trying to escape by the Baltic Sea or by traveling to the West trough a neighboring country's territory the number of victims could reach approximately one thousand.</seg>
<seg id="14">At any rate, it is considerably less than the 1841.</seg>
<seg id="15">Different methodologies could be one reason for the different numbers of victims.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Checkpoint Charlie museum also counts in all suicides of East German border guards, whether or not related to their service.</seg>
<seg id="17">The museum also counts the fatalities not related to direct use of force.</seg>
<seg id="18">"If seniors aged 70 to 80 died from a heart attack after a stressful contact with the border control," it also must be considered a consequence of the "murderous border", Hildebrandt believes.</seg>
<seg id="19">But Stadt is sure that one must differentiate between the old people who, possibly, died due to the attitude and conduct towards them and those who died due to protracted waiting inside a bus at the border in time of hot weather.</seg>
<seg id="20">Notwithstanding that, it is not easy to count the victims, because the authorities of the communist East Germany did not gather such statistics , so researchers must examine documents in various scattered archives, Stadt points out.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yet, Stadt's group recently has found more documents, therefore he might soon announce his new calculation of victims.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Latvian Swimming Federation's (LSF) president Kaspars Pone, who has recently become ill-famed, has arrived at Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games with a coach's accreditation; nevertheless, he is surprised at that.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Wednesday, a wide a hullabaloo was raised after the statements of Germans Jakubovskis, the coach of olympic swimmer Alona Ribakova, revealing that in the last minute Pone decided to go to Rio de Janeiro while the coach had to stay home.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alona Ribakova and Ulvis Kalnins, coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Collins as well as the federation's president Pone were in the initial list.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Latvian Swimming Federation applied with five participants for the Olympic Games and just before the flight Aldons Vrublevskis assured that Mr Germans will go and tickets are being booked.</seg>
<seg id="6">"But obviously due to objective reasons he did not manage to go," Pone said by expressing an opinion that it did not affect Ribakova's result.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the request of the federation the coach of Uvis had agreed to help her.</seg>
<seg id="8">Pone, who is a member of the LOC executive committee, harshly criticized LOC's activities when they blamed the organization supervising the Olympic sports.</seg>
<seg id="9">I believe that it is unethical to confirm five persons with the LOC executive committee and then not to take them all to the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I don't know why there were no vacant places for the Swimming Federation," Pone said, adding that the society does not value the work of the Federation and their presidents and reminded that the federations' presidents do not receive a salary.</seg>
<seg id="11">Pone also criticized Jakubovskis, stating that before the Olympic Games in London when Ribakova was not among the approved participants, he addressed the International Water Sports Federation (IWSF) and called Latvia not to send any athletes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pone could not comment why he arrived to the Olympic Games with a coach's accreditation, which, most probably, was meant for Jakubovskis.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I was declared as the team leader, but due to reasons unknown to me I received a coach's accreditation and now I cannot get in anywhere.''</seg>
<seg id="14">The situation changed every day, and the number of available accreditations also changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Until the last minute I thought that Mr German will come, because I had no other information.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the information possessed by LETA, several days before Ribakova's start she spoke tête-à-tête with Pone and afterwards the swimmer had tears in her eyes, yet the president of LSF himself told that it was a routine conversation aimed at putting the sportswoman in the right mood before the start.</seg>
<seg id="17">Pone reminded that the LSF supervises five sports disciplines, which are included in the Olympic program too, and in four of them also children are being trained in Latvia.</seg>
<seg id="18">The federation's president revealed that issues of drowning are essential for Latvia and he has spoken also about relevant programs while in Rio de Janeiro, for almost two weeks now.</seg>
<seg id="19">He praised the work of the federation and noted that the World Championship tournament could take place in Latvia in 2018.</seg>

<seg id="2">Within the framework of AS Latvenergo's fish stock recovery program, salmon and sea trout smolts will be released in the Daugava near Mangalsala this week. This year it is planned to release more than 600,000 one year old salmon and sea trout smolts grown in the "Tome" and "Dole" fisheries of the scientific institute Bior.</seg>
<seg id="3">Latvenergo informed news agency LETA that the fish release is going to continue also in the upcoming months: a total of 6,300,000 smolts and larvae of various species are released in the Daugava basin system annually.</seg>
<seg id="4">In spring 2016 and beginning of summer, pike and lamprey larvae will be released, as well as whitefish in June, summer salmon in July, and pike perches and vimbas in August and September.</seg>
<seg id="5">The production director of Latvenergo, Maris Kunickis said that care about the environment is one of sustainable development milestones of the holding company Latvenergo.</seg>
<seg id="6">"When implementing measures of fish stock protection and replenishing, every activity is aimed at environmentally friendly goals, in a close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior for growing fish and releasing them in the Daugava basin as well as implementing other activities," Kunickis pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 600,000 one year old salmon and sea trout smolts will be released in the Daugava estuary this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is the second year when smolts to be released are marked by cutting off the adipose fin.</seg>
<seg id="9">In today's cargo there are 25,000 salmon smolts with 31.3 grams average weight.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fish smolts and larvae in scientifically substantiated composition of species are released in the Daugava and its tributaries each year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fish stock propagation in Daugava and other watercourses of its basin pursuant to the laws and regulations is carried out by Bior on the basis of expertise of damage caused to fish stock resulting from Latvenergo's industrial activity and an opinion is formulated on what compensation measures are to be taken to ensure fish stock diversity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The State Environment Bureau, on the basis of said expertise, adopts a decision on the amount and type of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The total annual compensation from Latvenergo for the fish stock recovery program amounts to 1,035,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">In spring 2016, Latvenergo cooperated with the association "Mes zivim" (We for fish) to create 400 artificial fish spawning areas in the Daugava near Kaibala and Ikskile, for the fifth year already.</seg>
<seg id="15">The cooperation with the association, promoting natural spawning of fish, is an initiative additionally supported by Latvenergo within the framework of fish stock recovery.</seg>
<seg id="16">The placement of artificial spawning nests in a water-reservoir is an important measure for enhancing fish stock protection and growth in the Daugava.</seg>

<seg id="13">The splendid roster of performers boasts such names as violin player Eva Bindere, cello player Kristine Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinet player Guntis Kuzma, trumpet player Janis Porietis, piano player Reinis Zarins, quartets Quadra and RIX and even the Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross, who has created a contemporary circus piece called Confines portraying an artist's inner struggle and performed together with musicians Eriks Kirsfelds, Martins Zilberts and actress Ance Strazda.</seg>
<seg id="14">Several other new pieces have also been created.</seg>
<seg id="15">Children's performance "Bug", based of Kafka's story "The Metamorphosis" has been composed by Olesja Kozlovska and Jekabs Nimanis and will be staged with the participation of Armands Silins, musicians, actors and entomologist Ugis Piterans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Oskars Herlins has composed his first String quartet, while Anna Kirse offers her Tree Opera, a performance with trees as its main characters arranged in three small clusters in three hectares of clear felling; it is directed by Andris Kalnozols, supplemented with Katrina Neiburga's video projections and Andris Eglitis' stage design.</seg>

<seg id="1">Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected</seg>
<seg id="2">Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.</seg>
<seg id="3">Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.</seg>
<seg id="7">He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.</seg>
<seg id="8">Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</seg>
<seg id="9">Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said Trump is unfit for office.</seg>

<seg id="2">Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s' Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.</seg>
<seg id="3">But instead of famous naked people, they're setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.</seg>
<seg id="4">Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."</seg>
<seg id="5">I do this for women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Apparently he thinks the calendar is, too.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.</seg>
<seg id="9">Models can submit pics online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby 7s was brought to a crashing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a masterclass in handling, off-loading, side-stepping, support play, running lines and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">Defeat came with the non-too shabby consolation of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic 7s tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bruising beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, may have come back to bite them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, regardless, Fiji on this form would have beaten a fit as a fiddle 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It may be some consolation to GB - but probably not - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has been some journey for GB.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here, they lost just one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hammering will hurt but the progress is startling.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started magnificently, bouncing off GB tackles for fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was like running into a series of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and co and the World Series champions went 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau dived over in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes on the clock Jerry Tuwai added another down the right wing, which was converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB had hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A superb Mitchell tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third but it was only delaying Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">On seven minutes Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and GB were 17-0 to the bad.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added another from the restart and there was still over a minute on the clock ... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou then burst through some more limp GB tackling and stormed to the line to score.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion made it 29-0 at the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was as if Fiji had been born to play 7s, while GB are still learning the trade.</seg>
<seg id="22">Which is pretty much how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB made wholesale changes at half-time and they plugged the Fijian dam...for all of four minutes, which by first-half standards was good, until Josua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton grabbed a try for GB, touching down in the left corner to make it 36-7 but the game was long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was hard not to admire Fiji's whole joyful approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame iced the Fijian cake that didn't need icing with another try in the dying moments.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and GB hit the turf, thoroughly beaten.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in their semi-final and GB edged South Africa in a tight semi-final of one try each - Britain's conversion the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton with some dazzling footwork broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's cancer battle</seg>
<seg id="2">There will not be a more emotive gold at these games, and that is saying something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 punishing heaves into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Though they were the two pulling on the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams ever present as they powered to a second successive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first females in the annals of British sport to scale such a height.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all this was their 39th outing unbeaten, again unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see, two brilliant athletes skating over the surface with the elegance of swans, does not wholly reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of willing hands contributing the incremental gains that make the difference, and no hands were more instrumental than those of a coach who 30 months ago did not know whether he would live to see this day when diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, it was touch and go.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer which is one of the things they can operate on and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If they don't it goes everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It alters your outlook a bit.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were fortunate that he was able to begin his treatment at the start of 2014 out of season, keeping the disruption to a minimum, if that is ever the right expression in circumstances such as these.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed to get paid so I had to get better quickly.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20ft, 30ft 50ft at a time when they were saying a few steps is enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts off.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a journey but that makes it a bit bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervy morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to process his own anxieties.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment with a tour of Afghanistan behind her, said "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe that's a bit extreme, but it means such a lot."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just reiterates how much this means to me, how much me and Helen have worked and Robin as well.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's been a fantastic three years back with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thanks to him he's the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked for a better person to train with, or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair set a punishing rhythm that their rivals could never match.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the final 500 metres when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very much in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen was calling 'stay in the process, stay in the process'.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything amazing.</seg>
<seg id="33">We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking to do a good row and to go out and win that race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a year before deciding their futures.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has a wedding to attend next month, her own to television adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">For now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to realise that I was an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">This feels so much better," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to his words, now it is "important in principle" for the Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Union of Greens and Farmers) and the Minister for Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers), that Kolegova's candidacy for the position of the head of the SRS, supported by the Minister for Finance, is approved.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rajevskis assumed that approval of the SRS head is the "first big decision" in the government for both Kucinskis and Reizniece-Ozola and it might affect their political careers in the future.</seg>
<seg id="4">If they start changing their positions regarding the choice of the candidate for SRS head, it could adversely affect their image concerning governance issues.</seg>

<seg id="6">Kolegova was promoted for the position of the SRS head by the Minister for Finance, Reizniece-Ozola, after Inara Petersone stepped down from this position and the competition for the position of Director General of the SRS ended without results.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Thursday, August 11, Deputy head oft the SRS, Dace Peleka, told in an interview with the Latvian Radio, that if she was offered to run for the executive position she might agree.</seg>

<seg id="1">Spain's opportunity to reduce budget deficit compromised by failure to set up new government.</seg>
<seg id="2">A month ago, on July 12, the European Commission (EC) published an assessment that Spain and Portugal have not managed to implement a sufficient amount of measures to reduce their budget deficit to 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) as per the eurozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to some calculations, despite the implemented austerity measures Portugal's budget deficit stood at 4.4% of GDP and at 5.1% in Spain at the end of last year.</seg>
<seg id="4">The European Commission nevertheless decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries and instead only defined fiscal goals for the nearest period.</seg>
<seg id="5">One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions on the two countries is the growing euroscepticism in many EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="6">Additional sanctions would only add to such negative moods.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nevertheless, the critics have pointed out that the EC has been inconsistent in its decisions, because it had agreed on uniform rules and then turned out unable to apply them.</seg>
<seg id="8">For instance, Jens Weidmann, president of the German Bundesbank, has indicated that Europe starts losing its self-reliance by creating a public impression that European Union rules are merely recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now the EC has proposed, and all member states have approved, an extension of the term given for tidying up the budget issues by the end of the year for Portugal and by 2018 for Spain.</seg>
<seg id="10">The European Commission promises to check on the progress in both countries, while at the same time indicating that Spain and Portugal must be ready to for additional austerity measures, should the situation call for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Preliminary forecasts say that Portugal could manage achieving the stated goal within the given time-frame and its budget deficit might decrease to 2.5% of GDP already this year.</seg>
<seg id="12">It means that the country's government must go on with austerity measures related to the Stability Program in the amount of 0.25% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="13">These measures should be included in this year's budget and additional attention must be paid to the oversight of procurement of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Spain's case, the situation is more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its budget deficit must be reduced down to 4.6% this year, to 3.1% next year and to 2.2% of GDP in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="16">Additionally, during the next two years consolidation measures must be equal to 0.5% of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="17">The goal is especially difficult to achieve due to the fact that Spanish political parties have failed to agree on forming a new government for eight consecutive months, and the likelihood that Spain might be forced to organize early Parliament election for the third time in one year has increased.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion surveys show that a third election would not essentially change the national political pattern.</seg>
<seg id="19">The People's Party, headed by the present Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, is still the most popular one and it would again win up to 33% of votes in an election.</seg>
<seg id="20">Socialists are the only ones to have slightly increased their ratings while the popularity of parties speaking up against the austerity measures, such as Podemos ("Together we can") and Ciudadanos ("Citizens"), have decreased a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">The People's Party wants to involve socialists and Ciudadanos in the government already this month, otherwise it will not be able to approve and to submit to the European Commission the draft budget of 2017 by mid October.</seg>
<seg id="22">The faction representative of the People's Party, Rafael Hernando, announced that Spain would become a laughingstock for the entire Europe if the country fails to set up the government and instead the third election takes place.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cleanness of beaches around the Gulf of Riga is in critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="2">After five years of inspecting beaches, activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the amount of rubbish gradually increases year by year and beach visitors themselves are to blame in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="3">The most polluted swimming areas are located in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Riga City Council explains that the beaches are being cleaned on a daily basis but it is rather difficult to reign in littering visitors.</seg>
<seg id="5">Besides, garbage left on the ground can be washed into the water during heavy rain thus largely damaging its quality.</seg>
<seg id="6">Except Liepaja's beach and several places in Kurzeme, cleanness of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is in a similar critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="7">This conclusion was spread by the volunteers of a campaign called "My Sea".</seg>
<seg id="8">The activists, after walking along the Riga Gulf for the fifth year already, have realized that the amount of garbage discarded by visitors per hundred meters has increased.</seg>
<seg id="9">Unfortunately, this year the condition is evaluated as critical.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We see that this is going to be a year when the amount of garbage might exceed 200 units per 100 meters," says a representative of the expedition "My Sea", Janis Ulme.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the Latvian Radio called him, he was on the Tuja beach where the volunteers continue walking along the Riga Gulf coastline.</seg>
<seg id="12">This year, even fluorescent light-bulbs were found among the household waste items and picnic remains littering the beach sand.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ulme, who is a participant and organizer of the walk, tells that many people are to blame for the pollution.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The main source of pollution is beach visitors, because more than a half of the total garbage amount is plastic items and various other rubbish: plastic bags in degradation stage and they cannot be identified anymore, as well as cigarette butts, bottles, caps, etc.," Ulme explained.</seg>
<seg id="15">The swimming areas of Riga are also on the list of the dirtiest beaches.</seg>
<seg id="16">For example, in Daugavgriva we gathered almost 800 units per hundred meters on average and it is way more than acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="17">The organizers of the campaign explained that almost on every step one can see cigarette butts and that warning or prohibition signs are not placed everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The average numbers in all three swimming areas of Riga (Daugavgriva, Vakarbulli and Vecaki) are unfortunately huge and far from the desirable, or the goal to which Latvia ought to strive, in order to reduce the garbage to 135 units by 2020," the environmental activist concludes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Riga swimming areas are cleaned on a daily basis and even two times per day in the hottest summer periods, City Council's representative Ugis Vidauskis explained.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is, however, rather difficult to fight against untidy visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">Again, we face an issue of whether these persons are truly cultured.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Those, who litter, drink alcohol, smoke and do all that's prohibited, will not even care about special signs," Vidauskis emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore Vidauskis calls on the visitors of bathing places to even report polluters to the police.</seg>
<seg id="24">One can call police and confidentially report these violations and that is the way we can collectively fight such problems.</seg>
<seg id="25">Perhaps one can set up new warning signs, but, as I already told, it is not likely to make radical changes.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We all must address the authorities and must be intolerant towards such violators," he stresses.</seg>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile water quality measurements have been performed by the State Health Inspectorate for the fourth time this summer, and the agency is entitled to impose prohibition on official bathing places.</seg>
<seg id="28">This year, just like the previous years, water quality is good or satisfactory everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="29">Currently the water quality at all 56 swimming places remains good and there are no swimming restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We will take the last samples of water at the end of August," Normunds Kadikis, senior specialist in environmental health issues of the Inspectorate, revealed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Dropped garbage can be washed into water during heavy rain.</seg>
<seg id="32">Consequently, it can affect water quality, the environmental expert points out.</seg>

<seg id="1">Reshuffle among Russian elite continues: Putin's executive office appoints new chief of staff</seg>
<seg id="2">Did he step down voluntarily?</seg>
<seg id="3">Vladimir Putin told Russian media that Sergey Ivanov wanted to leave his position but will remain as the President's special representative in nature preservation, environmental and transportation matters.</seg>
<seg id="4">When informing about the changes, Putin spoke approvingly of Ivanov in front of cameras: "Dear Sergey Borisovich, I have worked together with you for many years and we are doing it successfully."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am satisfied with the way you carry out your job.</seg>
<seg id="6">I remember well our agreement to employ you in this position at the Presidential Executive Office for no more than four years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Therefore I understand your wish to change the things you work on.</seg>
<seg id="8">And I hope you will make the most of your skills and experience in the new position.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, it has been pointed out that being in charge of the Presidential Executive Office is a very powerful position and that through it Ivanov has become one of the most influential persons in the entire country.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the context of the Russian State Duma elections approaching next month, there have been rumors that this change is related to a power struggle among the country's political elite.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ivanov has even been mentioned as a prospective successor of Putin as the president, which casts doubt on the assertion that Ivanov would willingly become the President's representative in environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to information available to Lsm.lv, Ivanov is a Colonel General of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ivanov is a close and long-term ally of the Russian President Vladimir Putin.</seg>
<seg id="14">He started his career in secret services in 1975, where he met Putin.</seg>
<seg id="15">Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov was assigned as his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the end of the Russian President Boris Yeltsin's term in office, Ivanov was appointed as the Secretary of Russian Security Council.</seg>
<seg id="17">In year 2000, when Putin came to power, an "Information Security Doctrine" developed by Ivanov and actually reviving government-run censorship in Russia was made official.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 2001, Sergey Ivanov became the Minister for Defense of Russia and, in 2005, deputy of Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov, also becoming responsible for the development of Russian defense industry's companies and arms export.</seg>
<seg id="19">After leaving the current position, Ivanov will retain a job at Russia's National Security Council and work together with Vaino, the new head of the Presidential Executive Office.</seg>
<seg id="20">Vaino comes from a family of Soviet party elite.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ivanov himself allegedly encouraged Vaino to pursue the leading position at the Presidential Executive Office.</seg>
<seg id="22">Anton Eduardovich and I have known each other for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, it goes back to the times when we worked under your leadership in government.</seg>
<seg id="24">For the last five years, we keep in touch with each other on an almost daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Therefore I am sure that in terms of all professional and individual characteristics he is ready for this job'', Ivanov said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Vaino comes from a family that was part of the Soviet party elite.</seg>
<seg id="27">His granddad Karl had high-ranking positions in the Communist Party of the Soviet Estonia, serving as its First Secretary for ten years up until 1988.</seg>
<seg id="28">The online media outlet Meduza, using a book "Estonian Self-determination and Independence" as it source, has reported that in late 1980s Karl Vaino had asked Moscow to authorize violent oppressive actions against participants of political rallies.</seg>
<seg id="29">Somehow the authorization wasn't granted and it wasn't long before he lost his position.</seg>
<seg id="30">Shortly afterwards Vaino moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="31">Anton Vaino graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations and speaks Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, he left the diplomatic career to work in the Presidential Protocol Administration.</seg>
<seg id="33">As reported, during recent weeks Russia has been rocked by dismissal of several high-ranking officials and even arrests, including the replacement of several district governors and federal representatives.</seg>
<seg id="34">According to political scientists, Vladimir Putin is reorganizing the elite circles before the upcoming elections of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="35">Of note is that persons from military, security and law enforcement authorities are increasingly appointed to nationally leading positions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judo fighter Nikiforenko loses in the first fight of the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="2">This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian judo fighter has already concluded his participation in the Olympic Games with the 17th place.</seg>
<seg id="3">His coach Olegs Baskins admitted to the Latvian Television that Nikiforenko had little hope and it was clear before the contest.</seg>
<seg id="4">He also revealed that the athlete got a shoulder injury during the fight.</seg>
<seg id="5">It must be noted that, in order to get his Olympic opportunity, Nikiforenko had to fight in a different weight division than his usual, namely in the weight division of up to 100 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Azerbaijani athlete was 25 kg heavier.</seg>
<seg id="7">As reported, in the weight division up to 100 kilograms, Jevgenijs Borodavko manged to hold out against Ryunosuke for two and a half minutes, until the opponent implemented a clear victory throw.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore the judo contest in Rio is over for Latvia.</seg>
</p>

<doc sysid="ref" docid="lsm.lv.53473" genre="news" origlang="lv">
<p>
<seg id="1">Athletes' dreams crushed in Rio sand.</seg>
<seg id="2">Thursday saw the entrance of judo fighter Jevgenijs Borodavko.</seg>
<seg id="3">He indeed had a more prize-winning opponent, but the ambitious can sometimes surprise.</seg>
<seg id="4">He did not, however.</seg>
<seg id="5">A task for Arturs Nikiforenko was even more complicated, because he had less experience and a very respectable opponent.</seg>
<seg id="6">The outcome was similar, even though he managed to remain on the mat for one and a half minute longer than Borodavko did.</seg>
<seg id="7">Unfortunately, the Latvian judo fighters mainly seem to lack ambition.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since Gunars Kirsons and his financial supporter Vladimirs Sestakovs stepped aside from the management and Aleksandrs Jackevics left Latvia, the Golden Score event is not organized anymore, and thus the development of judo is slowly deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="9">No successors are seen for Jackevics, who consults judo fighters from Kazakhstan, and for Vsevolods Zelonijs.</seg>
<seg id="10">But if one does not help the athletes grow, the outcome will be poor.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is the federation's prerogative.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore the Judo Federation's president's promise to win medals in Rio came as if from another galaxy in the Morning Panorama news.</seg>
<seg id="13">Dreams are far from reality.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the evening we were impatiently and anxiously looking forward to the beach volleyball match of Samoilovs/Smedins against Evandro/Pedro Solberg.</seg>
<seg id="15">The intrigue was just like in a "death" group, because the Olympics is over for those who lose.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Latvian team had a small reserve: they could lose but by not more than 4 points in two sets.</seg>
<seg id="17">A protracted previous game just added to their stress.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nobody wanted to "die" - this feeling could be sensed over the windy court for the entire match.</seg>
<seg id="19">The gusty wind created additional complexity for the players.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the beginning it seemed that our players, being more versatile, would benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="21">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus it was rather easy to defeat the Latvian pair.</seg>
<seg id="23">Just serve toward Samoilovs and wait for him to break.</seg>
<seg id="24">He started to break in the game against Canada but broke against Cuba at the end of the 1st set and the beginning of 3rd set, because it was a huge physical challenge.</seg>
<seg id="25">Smedins could go fishing meanwhile, because he had little to do, but when he did, he did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="26">Samoilovs and Smedins could win against the Brazilians in two sets, because they took a lead in the first one with 16-15, but remained at 16 points thus exhausting the limit of lost points.</seg>
<seg id="27">They could also lose with 0-2, because in the 2nd set they had a deficit of -4, however they managed to win, also thanks to the wind.</seg>
<seg id="28">The 3rd set went under Evandro's serves.</seg>
<seg id="29">One could observe a chain pattern: unconvincing return of a serve, the second pass sometimes flies too close to the net and Samoilovs having few options for an efficient attack.</seg>
<seg id="30">If an unseen Samoilovs was in the court during the game against Cubans, now he returned to playing more efficiently and it would be incorrect to blame only Aleksandrs for the loss.</seg>
<seg id="31">Also Kreilis made a mistake and it was symbolic that he was the one to send the last ball into the block.</seg>
<seg id="32">The loss was by the team.</seg>
<seg id="33">This time luck had also turned away: in the third set alone, two attacks by Evandro almost went outside the court, but the ball did hit the line.</seg>
<seg id="34">Two aces landed next to the line.</seg>
<seg id="35">In this contestable situation, a video playback gave the victory to the opponents.</seg>
<seg id="36">If Evandro was struggling with serves in the first two games, he became very efficient in the game against our players.</seg>
<seg id="37">Eventually it resulted in a loss, shown on the scoreboard.</seg>
<seg id="38">The causes of this failure could now be analyzed with some detachment.</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps they should have, as many did, stayed near the stadium and not with the rest of the delegation in the Olympic Village.</seg>
<seg id="40">Two and a half hours were lost commuting.</seg>
<seg id="41">Perhaps some confidence was given to them by a series of seven semifinals.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or perhaps, they should not have played in Klagenfurt and instead arrive here earlier and adapt to the situation.</seg>
<seg id="43">Perhaps there was a mistake in finding their best athletic shape.</seg>
<seg id="44">For the time being, there are more questions than answers.</seg>
<seg id="45">The games are over for our beach volleyball players.</seg>
<seg id="46">And so is the dream about winning medals.</seg>
<seg id="47">What's next?</seg>
<seg id="48">There remain a few World Cup tournaments and also the Jurmala "Masters".</seg>
<seg id="49">Smedins and Samoilovs have never been friends outside the sport and will probably not become such, because their personalities are just too different.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it is also not necessary .</seg>
<seg id="51">When a dream about Olympic medals dies, one could start thinking of splitting up, because the fault will be searched for not only in oneself but also in the teammate.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is not difficult to split up, but it is much harder to find an appropriate teammate in Latvia.</seg>
<seg id="53">Both athletes have brothers who play beach volleyball, but Janis and Toms have tried and also split up, while Mihails Samoilovs is still too fresh to start aiming for global top positions.</seg>
<seg id="54">He could try it with Haralds Regza, Aleksandrs Solovejs, Edgars Tocs, or reunite with Martins Plavins, but that combination will be in no way better than the current one, as seen several times during the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="55">The sand of Copacabana was not their friend this time.</seg>
<seg id="56">And that's about it.</seg>
<seg id="57">Of course, one must also take into consideration that beach volleyball is gaining popularity and new pairs join and only a few players are below two meters in height.</seg>
<seg id="58">It does not automatically guarantee success, but is an essential argument when struggling to win.</seg>
<seg id="59">Our athletes cannot grow taller.</seg>
<seg id="60">Both athletes and journalists can stay in accommodations offered by the games' organizers or rely on their personal choice.</seg>
<seg id="61">US men's basketball team lives on a cruise ship, and some tennis players do not stay at the Olympic Village.</seg>
<seg id="62">Also some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Copacabana.</seg>
<seg id="63">This time the modest accommodation offered to journalists was overpriced.</seg>
<seg id="64">Therefore we chose to rent an apartment.</seg>
<seg id="65">It is risky, because sometimes it can be inconvenient in terms of logistics.</seg>
<seg id="66">This time the risk paid off.</seg>
<seg id="67">Together with Vladimirs we rented an apartment on the border of Copacabana and Ipanema.</seg>
<seg id="68">The beach was 200 meters away and the beach volleyball arena in 30 minutes' walk.</seg>
<seg id="69">The area was rather safe because the favelas were far away, yet one should be careful here as well.</seg>
<seg id="70">"Vladimirs" is not the person one might think about globally; in fact, we mean the most experienced sports journalist in the Russian-language media in Latvia, Vladimirs Ivanovs.</seg>
<seg id="71">P.S. It looks like another dream about medals has died on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="72">Laura Ikauniece-Admidina fell behind her previous personal records in 100-meter hurdles and high jump.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Porgy and Bess" returns to stage after 10 years' break in Liepāja.</seg>
<seg id="2">The opera "Porgy and Bess" was first performed in Latvia in 1973, as a production of the Latvian National Opera.</seg>
<seg id="3">But, since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not seen another production.</seg>
<seg id="4">Aware of this, the organizers of the Cesis Art Festival, in close cooperation with the organizers of the Liepaja Art Forum, decided to give audience an opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin's masterpiece again.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We are extremely happy that, after a ten years' break since Liepaja could enjoy this opera for the last time, the new wonderful concert version of George Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" has returned to the recently opened Great Amber concert hall", head of the concert hall Great Amber Baiba Boze told us.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Porgy and Bess" is a story told in vivid operatic language about love, its impermanence, passion as well as everyday tragedies and simple joys of daily life.</seg>
<seg id="7">It reflects the Afro-American vitality, music and rhythms.</seg>
<seg id="8">The opera is so alive, because it forgoes political correctness and is unaware of our modern polities.</seg>
<seg id="9">"And yes, this love story is very powerful, very beautiful and, in some respect, truly profound," said director Viesturs Kairiss.</seg>
<seg id="10">When listening to or performing this opera, my favorite moments are its most popular tunes, famous motifs and transitions from one character to another by illuminating one person after another or alternately the choir and then the orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The building is the most exciting part," the production is thus evaluated by Andris Poga, musical director and conductor of the "Porgy and Bess" concert version.</seg>
<seg id="12">Audiences of the opera all agree that it is a cultural landmark.</seg>
<seg id="13">They appear overjoyed at the possibility to see this world-renowned work by Gershwin.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is so good to feel the world's culture descending in Liepaja.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Professional performance," commented Edgars Lams after listening to the opera.</seg>
<seg id="16">The concert version in the new concert hall Great Amber was significant due to the facts that an orchestra was playing in the orchestra pit for the first time and that an opera concert version was staged for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="1">The square near the renovated building of the Latvian Museum of Art could be named after Janis Rozentals.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Riga Vice Mayor Andris Ameriks announced during the opening of the Rozentals anniversary exhibition that the museum's address in the future might become 1 Janis Rozentals Square instead of 10a Krisjana Valdemara Street.</seg>
<seg id="3">The museum's director Mara Lace remarked that a re-registration of its address would result in a serious amount of unnecessary paperwork, but in general she might like the idea and therefore agreed to support this initiative by the municipal authority.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Riga City has preceded this idea in 1936 by erecting a monument for Janis Rozentals by sculptor Burkards Dzenis, which is stands in front of the museum.</seg>
<seg id="5">The museum's then-director Vilhelms Purvitis was one of the promoters of the monument.</seg>
<seg id="6">The newest initiative might thus be considered its logical continuation.</seg>
<seg id="7">I have constant remorse: what about Vilhelms Purvitis, where shall we enshrine his name?</seg>

<seg id="1">Reconstruction of VEF Culture Palace will finally start this week.</seg>
<seg id="2">Limited-liability company Velve is going to renovate the Palace for approximately 11 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is planned to renovate several interior parts of the palace, including two auditoriums, and to make the building accessible for persons with reduced mobility.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Riga City Council intends to attract EU funding for the project in the amount of six million euros, but Olegs Burovs, the director or the Riga City Council's Property Department, admits that currently there is no absolute clarity about the European money for this project.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Notwithstanding that, there is a political will to start the repair works at the VEF Culture Palace and attracting European structural funds, we have been waiting for months for a decision, some real move by the officials of the Ministry of Finance, to understand if that money is granted or not," Burovs says.</seg>
<seg id="6">Last December we were told that it completely depends on Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two weeks ago the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission telling us to make a decision and that Brussels is not the entity to do that.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now we see that another discussion round is being created, so let's see what to expect in the closest days to come.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want to confirm that the Riga City Council definitely guarantees that this process will be begun and completed in a timely manner," Burovs says.</seg>
<seg id="10">As reported more than a year ago, in March 2015 the arts collectives of the VEF Culture Palace organized a farewell concert since the building's renovation was about to start very soon.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though a year has passed, the renovation has not started and the collectives have continued working in unsuitable conditions.</seg>
<seg id="12">The strategy elaborated by the Riga City Council's Property Department for the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is divided into seemingly independent units of reconstruction works each of those relate to different functions of the palace.</seg>
<seg id="13">The first one concerns improvements of the VEF Culture Palace's accessibility and landscaping of the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="14">It implies rebuilding the surrounding territory and utilities as well as renovating the building's exterior.</seg>
<seg id="15">The second part concerns improvement of the VEF Culture Palace's range of services.</seg>
<seg id="16">It mentions an improvement of building's interior; wall and ceiling restoration; stage and recording studio improvements; renovating the cabling and plumbing.</seg>
<seg id="17">The third part: improvement of work conditions of the amateur arts collectives, namely, improvement of workshop equipment, heating and ventilation systems.</seg>

<seg id="1">Legendary rock band "Livi" 40th anniversary anticipated with exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2">The exhibition will feature various items characterizing "Livi": a timeline with photos reflects the band's activities from its beginnings until 2010 when the band officially announced the end of its career.</seg>
<seg id="3">Band members' costumes, instruments, awards and taped live performances as well as other items yet unseen by a wider public yet telling the story of "Livi" will also be on display.</seg>
<seg id="4">The exhibition has received some items from the Liepaja Museum collection.</seg>
<seg id="5">The visual design of the exhibition was created in cooperation with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.</seg>
<seg id="6">Also other musicians who had this or another kind of connection with "Livi" as well as their families came up and shared both items and memories.</seg>
<seg id="7">The story of "Livi" began in 1972 when Juris Pavitols founded a band of popular music.</seg>
<seg id="8">The band's first line-up participated in the "Liepajas dzintars" festival in 1972 and 1974 as well as performance review concerts around Latvia.</seg>
<seg id="9">Year 1976 marked a decisive turn when Juris Pavitols met Eriks Kigelis: the band found a base at the Metal Worker's Culture Hall and invited Ingrida Gutmane, Andris Kruzins and Janis Grodums to join.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later the band's line-up changed many times.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some musicians joined, others left and some returned again.</seg>
<seg id="12">The major, perhaps most enduring motif was the desire to show that the Latvian rock music can live on.</seg>
<seg id="13">"There was a lot to see: jeans, long hair and beards; these guys were different from the conventional stereotype of a crooner on stage," music journalist Klass Vavere comments about the band.</seg>
<seg id="14">Such popular musicians as Igo, Vilnis Krievins, Modris Sterns, Valdis Starks, Laims Racenajs, Talis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brize, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many more can be mentioned among the participants of the band.</seg>
<seg id="15">Entrance to the exhibition is free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="16">It runs from August 19 until October 30.</seg>
<seg id="17">On August 27, the 40th anniversary of "Livi" will be marked with "LIVIfest 2" at the Liepaja concert garden "Put, vejini".</seg>

<seg id="1">By withdrawing her candidacy for the position of Director General of the State Revenue Service (SRS), the head of the State Environment Service Inga Kolegova has saved the government from collapsing, believes Ojars Skudra, prof. asoc. of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.</seg>
<seg id="2">Kolegova's explanation about her withdrawal of the candidacy in the context of controversies in the leading coalition is related to the fact that she has prevented the government from falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="3">In conversation with the LETA news agency Skudra revealed that it is hard to imagine that in next week's session the Unity political party could support Kolegova's candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore, if the ministers from Unity voted against but Kolegova would be elected anyway, it would lead to the resignation of the government.</seg>
<seg id="5">The expert also believes that Kolegova had consulted both with the Minister for Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola and Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis before she announced that she withdraws her candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time it means giving in to Unity which strongly opposes her candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="7">If one should predict, whether it will be possible to find a more suitable candidate through a competition, Skudra told that there are two options: either a compromise figure is selected or the Deputy Director General Dace Peleka continues heading the institution.</seg>
<seg id="8">He also points out that if the Minister for Finance so far asserted that another candidate is not being considered now, it is a hint to Peleka that she is not invited to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="9">As LETA already informed, the State Environment Service head Inga Kolegova decided to withdraw her candidacy for the position of Director General of the SRS.</seg>
<seg id="10">Due to objections voiced by Unity, on Wednesday the government postponed Kolegova's approval for the position of Director General of SRS for one week.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the government adopted a decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova assured that she is still ready to become the head of the SRS.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, later she changed her mind: on Friday, in her application to the Minister for Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, she points out that she withdraws her consent to be transferred as the head of SRS and that it is not an easy choice for her.</seg>

<seg id="1">New playgrounds in Riga for children and happier parents.</seg>
<seg id="2">This summer the Riga City Council has introduced two more playgrounds, in Kipsala and Ciekurkalns, which are already available for children.</seg>
<seg id="3">A spacious, multifunctional ship-like play-structure with various climbing elements, little bridges, games, tubes and slides has been set up on the Kipsala beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">The playground is intended for children of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are also swings and various balancing challenges.</seg>
<seg id="6">The nautically-themed fantasy world is enhanced by its location near the Daugava riverbank, opening a view to the Passenger Terminal and cruise ships.</seg>
<seg id="7">Another playground, erected between Ciekurkalns Avenues No. 4 and No. 5, contains a play house, trampoline, step track, balance bridge, swings, play balls and other play elements as well as an exercise zone with special rings for strength and coordination training, parallel bars and other devices.</seg>
<seg id="8">The playground's floor is covered with a colorful rubber mat.</seg>

<seg id="1">Reconstructed road section opened in Medumi.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of the SJSC Latvian State Roads (LSR) and representatives of the construction company SIA Binders as well as local municipality representatives today opened a reconstructed road section of the motor road connecting the border of Russia (Grebneva), Rezekne, Daugavpils and the border of Lithuania (Medumi): from Medumi to the border of Lithuania (156.4th -163.05th km).</seg>
<seg id="3">Roads are the country's business card, especially border area roads, therefore we are especially excited to open the reconstructed section near our southern neighboring country.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is another example showing that thanks to co-financing by the European Union funds the situation of the national motor roads improves.</seg>
<seg id="5">"According to forecasts, the funds available for roads in this planning period will be acquired already in 2018 and we have to think how to further maintain the most heavily used motor roads in very good quality and how to ensure mobility in all regions of Latvia without the European Union funding," Uldis Augulis said when cutting the symbolic ribbon.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Minister for Transport also pointed out that proposals on sustainable financing for Latvia's roads, prepared by traffic experts, will be soon presented to the government.</seg>
<seg id="7">Roadworks from Medumi to the border of Lithuania (156.4th- 163.05th km) were started by SIA Binders last year and continued this year after a technological pause.</seg>
<seg id="8">The reconstruction costs are 13.5 million euros (VAT inclusive), and the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).</seg>
<seg id="9">"The road structure has been completely restored in the reconstructed road section and next year construction works will start again in the next section: from Medumi to Daugavpils, thus the entire road section from the border of Lithuania to Daugavpils will be reconstructed", Janis Lange, the chairman of LSR informed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The national motor roads are the most heavily used, and we plan to ensure that by 2018 all national motor roads are in good condition.</seg>
<seg id="11">The next task will be to maintain them in shape by timely maintenance and replacement of road surface every 7 to 9 years.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It will require proper funding, of course, and all the involved are hopeful about proposals elaborated by the expert group concerning the road financing system's improvement," Lange noted.</seg>
<seg id="13">Road connections and lighting in the center of Medumi center have been improved as part of the project.</seg>
<seg id="14">Large-scale earthwork has also been completed: massive removal of peat and large-scale entrenchment and embankment works; the previously uneven longitudinal road profile has been leveled out in four large sections.</seg>
<seg id="15">Public transport stops have been renovated, and a square for public transport maneuvering (for making turns) has been built anew.</seg>
<seg id="16">Previously, the road did not have sufficient bearing capacity and the surrounding terrain prevented good visibility due to hills and valleys, and also the old road went along the course of the natural terrain.</seg>
<seg id="17">During the next construction season, it is planned to reconstruct the motor road section from the Daugavpils city border until the currently reconstructed section (144.80thto 156.40th km).</seg>
<seg id="18">This year, LSR plans to carry out different roadworks along more than 1,100 kilometers of national roads.</seg>
<seg id="19">Information about all the planned repair works on national road network is available on LSR's website at www.lvceli.lv.</seg>

<seg id="1">"For achieving the desired results in weight loss, a crucial factor is choosing your combinations of foods properly," believes the Lithuanian dietician Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.</seg>
<seg id="2">And it shouldn't be that complicated during the summer season when fresh fruit, berries and vegetables are available from our gardens.</seg>
<seg id="3">Well-considered combining of foodstuffs not only can help you in losing weight but also directly promote various useful processes in the body.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pasta and vinegar make a good combination as they fill you up and help reducing body fat.</seg>
<seg id="5">Studies published in the the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition show proof that vinegar favorably affects blood glucose levels and increases general vitality.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thus, cayenne pepper and high-protein dishes such as poultry or protein mixes not only provide a sensation of satiety, but also reduce craving for large portions in subsequent meals.</seg>
<seg id="7">This product combination can increase the amount of burnt calories after the meal even by up to 35 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">Research indicates that cayenne pepper can help getting rid of abdominal fat.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eggs contain a metabolism-boosting nutrient called choline, while bell pepper is a great source of vitamin C.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sufficient intake of these nutrients may reduce one's cortisol level and thus ward off fat deposits around the waist.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oatmeal porridge with fresh berries is another kind of tasty fat-burning breakfast, worth including in your menu.</seg>
<seg id="12">Oatmeal and berries contain dietary fiber which, according to some findings of Canadian scientists, control ghrelin, a hormone responsible for appetite and the amount of food we eat.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moreover, berries contain polyphenols which help losing weight and prevent increases in body fat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Vegetables and protein can also work wonders in weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="15">Combined in one meal, they can make you feel satiated.</seg>
<seg id="16">Vegetables contain water and dietary fiber therefore they also make you feel full.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the same time protein slows down digestion and prevents feeling hungry for a longer time.</seg>
<seg id="18">For lunch, you may want to choose chicken with salad or prepare a dose of protein mix and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="19">Food combinations to avoid.</seg>
<seg id="20">Fruit contains sugars known as monosaccharides and disaccharides, appearing as single molecules or pairs.</seg>
<seg id="21">By comparison, the starch found for example in vegetables is a polysaccharide.</seg>
<seg id="22">Fruits are digested in the stomach mechanically but not chemically; the latter takes place when they reach the third or fourth stage in the digestive system, i.e., the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="23">Digestion of starch is split over three various stages, starting in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="24">Therefore it is essential not to eat a dessert right after a meal.</seg>
<seg id="25">If you do eat the dessert right after, it becomes "trapped" in the stomach together with other foods, yet it is not properly chemically digested and starts putrefying.</seg>
<seg id="26">Certainly avoid consuming bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other high-carbohydrate foods together with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other sour fruits.</seg>
<seg id="27">The enzyme ptyalin, found in saliva, is active only in alkaline environment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Fruit acids not only hinder the digestion of carbs, but also activate their fermentation.</seg>
<seg id="29">Do not combine eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar protein-rich pairs in one meal.</seg>
<seg id="30">Different digestive fluids are required for digesting these, each fluid having a different acidity, characteristics and time to appear in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="31">Watermelon, honeydew, muskmelon and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.</seg>
<seg id="32">Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach together with other foodstuff.</seg>
<seg id="33">Combinations of fats and high-protein foods.</seg>
<seg id="34">Fat makes a good combination with starch, but that is not the case with fats and proteins: fat impedes the digestion of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="35">However, proteins can be combined with small amounts of fat.</seg>
<seg id="36">If you tend to have a protein-rich diet, avoid consuming fats altogether.</seg>
<seg id="37">The same applies also to the raw food diet: it is not recommended to combine large quantities of nuts (which contain protein) with an entire avocado (contains fats).</seg>
<seg id="38">Such combination hampers weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="39">Best ways of cooking.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Cooking by heating the ingredients results in considerable loss of nutrients - about 15 to 55 percent of their initial nutritional value," points out the dietician.</seg>
<seg id="41">In many cases nutrients are destroyed, if the cooking method is boiling.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yet, the overall nutrition value of certain foodstuffs actually increases with boiling.</seg>
<seg id="43">The liquid that remains after boiling your vegetables can be later used for making soup: thus you will not lose nutrients that dissolved in the water and they'll still be part of your meal.</seg>
<seg id="44">The most recommended cooking method for vegetables is steaming.</seg>
<seg id="45">Thermal processing considerably increases the availability of lycopene found in tomatoes.</seg>
<seg id="46">After 30 minutes of boiling, the lycopene level in tomatoes rises by 25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="47">Thermal processing also considerably increases the availability of beta-carotene, found in red, yellow and orange plants, for instance tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.</seg>
<seg id="48">Thermal processing of eggs and meat change some of the proteins' natural properties thus making them easier to digest.</seg>
<seg id="49">Moreover, thermal processing of meat and eggs facilitates the absorption of iron and other minerals contained in these foods.</seg>
<seg id="50">Bear in mind that freezing can reduce the quantities of vitamin C by 10 to a whopping 90 percent, yet freezing does not affect the fiber content.</seg>
<seg id="51">Combined with tomatoes, beans can increase iron uptake in humans, resulting in a better brain and muscle performance.</seg>
<seg id="52">Our body absorbs up to 33 percent less of the non-blood-building iron found in such plant-based foods as beans, leafy greens and cereal grains than the blood-building iron found in animal products such as beef, chicken or fish.</seg>
<seg id="53">You can considerably increase the absorption of non-blood-building iron by combining products that contain it with additional vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.</seg>
<seg id="54">Vitamin C helps to alter non-blood building iron in such a way that our body can take it up more easily.</seg>
<seg id="55">Iron is necessary for producing hemoglobin, which in its turn transports oxygen to muscle and brain.</seg>
<seg id="56">To get the ultimate benefit from salads, add healthy fats such as olive oil or linseed oil.</seg>
<seg id="57">When preparing sandwiches with salmon (ample source of vitamin D) or sardines, add plain yogurt - a great source of calcium.</seg>
<seg id="58">Vitamin D increases the quantity of calcium absorbed in the intestines, thus it is important in bone building process.</seg>
<seg id="59">Oats (as well as other wholegrain products) combined with sources of vitamin C, for example, strawberries, black currant, raspberries and other fruits or berries, helps to stabilize the cholesterol level and to prevent artery clogging.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its lens tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to alter reality and play with identity in ways that border on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character befitting a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The lenses are blunt, feature-warping tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Any missteps quickly enter the public record.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat lenses have drawn criticism in the past with accusations that the app was promoting blackface or encouraging whitened skin tones as an ideal of beauty.</seg>
<seg id="8">So when it pushed a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, distorted teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface."</seg>
<seg id="9">And they wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the outrage went wide on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had dismantled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.</seg>
<seg id="12">But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens reminded them of hurtful stereotypes in action.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others roundly rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said that the lens was "hurtful and uncomfortable to say the least."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it's hard to argue with the side by side comparison of the very gross Asian caricature and the filter's effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter isn't just yellowface, but yellowface taken to its derogatory extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural tripwires.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems involved in an endless struggle over diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's huge audience of younger people - who are more racially diverse than their older counterparts - might mean that they are even more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is insulting to a user, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for these types of things to go unnoticed like they did before."</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that the race-related controversies reflected a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ms. Zhu criticized the company's mostly white, all-male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"It's either that they had no diverse representation of people of color on their staff to the point where they're able to make decisions like this," Ms. Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they do have some people of color who are working there, but they're not on positions where they feel safe or comfortable to speak up."</seg>
<seg id="25">Other observers share her view, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not release figures about diversity on its staff, noting its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on driving inclusion efforts internally.</seg>
<seg id="28">For her part, Ms. Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence, Congressional Panel Says</seg>
<seg id="2">Officials from the United States Central Command altered intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report issued Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The interim report, from a task force established by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said superiors were doctoring their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Fla., that oversees American military operations across the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Intelligence products approved by senior Centcom leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. antiterrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community," a news release about the report said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our war fighters suffer when bad analysis is presented to senior policy makers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership failures at Centcom reach to the very top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 10-page report detailed persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in Central Command's description and analysis of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although it offers no definitive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be doctored, it describes analysts as feeling as though they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional testimonies were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom official stated publicly that a major military assault to take back Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"After months of investigation, this much is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command's intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">Republicans created the task force after learning that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report released Thursday is to be followed up by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is an additional, ongoing investigation of Centcom intelligence by the Department of Defense inspector general.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly insular process for producing intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi Security Forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, Mr. Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence products," hurt morale among analysts and "insufficiently accommodated dissenting views."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions to a "preset or political narrative."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of the Pentagon inspector general investigation, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continued.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is succeeding (an assertion now made by a growing number of Defense officials).</seg>
<seg id="27">But last year's allegations called into question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis spots.</seg>
<seg id="28">The critiques on the Islamic State intelligence mirror disputes of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper saying that the administration of President George W. Bush, over many analysts" objections, advocated a small force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key part in the insurrection over the Islamic State intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, officials said, Mr. Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the finding was not distributed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcom's commander then, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony viewed by many lawmakers as being an overly positive assessment of the war.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans defeated India, 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should be a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said she was not sure if she had ever done the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no clue," she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.</seg>
<seg id="6">Here is what she does know: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and are tied for first place in their group with Britain, which remained unbeaten after defeating Japan, 2-0, on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have qualified for the quarter finals, and the game will decide who finishes first in their six-team bracket and who finishes second.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-place finisher will avoid the powerful Dutch, the leaders of the other bracket, for a bit longer when the quarter finals begin.</seg>
<seg id="10">However Saturday's game turns out, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising run here, four years after finishing last among 12 teams at the London Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bam was on that team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pa., first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16, becoming its youngest player ever.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed out on the 2008 Olympics when she did not make the cut for the final roster.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came 2012, when nothing much went right for her and her teammates.</seg>
<seg id="15">The next year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was named the coach, and things began to change.</seg>
<seg id="16">"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam said.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the work rate in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We've made a complete turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a backhand shot from close in.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had come into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took charge.</seg>
<seg id="21">She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then curled into the middle and whipped the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the tournament for the United States goalie, Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three victories.</seg>
<seg id="24">She is on a roll.</seg>
<seg id="25">So is Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're in a good place right now," Parnham said, but just how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's game.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Depressing Food of the Depression, in "A Square Meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">A gourmand, President Roosevelt had a taste for fancy Fifth Avenue foods like pâté de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu that day was more humble: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr. Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ms. Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side tenement through food in her book "97 Orchard."</seg>
<seg id="9">Their new, collaborative work, "A Square Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food in the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny no-frills lunch counter in the Flatiron district that has been in business since the year of the crash, 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ms. Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and chopped olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, had the turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable medley.</seg>
<seg id="12">When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple deemed it fitting for a discussion of Depression-era eating.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Loaves were very popular," Ms. Ziegelman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were made from an ingredient and a cheap thing that stretches the ingredient out.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating enough peanuts to serve as your dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Coe grimaced.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It must have sat in your stomach like lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male farmworkers, and fresh-baked pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" chronicles the ways the nation coped with suddenly not being the land of plenty.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This was a time when food became a central, fraught subject for the American people," Mr. Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Equally fraught was the new budget diet: Mystery dishes like loaves and casseroles became staples, the casserole a "wonderful way to repurpose leftovers," Ms. Ziegelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy coating of sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, for years the center of the American meal, became a sparingly apportioned luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mashups were tried as caloric and nutritional fulfillment took precedent over taste or even common kitchen sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">In researching the book, which includes recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a period dish of baked onion stuffed with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Mr. Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Ms. Ziegelman amplified: "It was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter has nothing to say to a baked onion.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was characteristic of a lot of the home-ec recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, home economists - among them Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeteers" and rise to the challenge of transforming glop like creamed spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.</seg>
<seg id="34">"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical tidbits.</seg>
<seg id="35">Especially savory are the accounts of the government's response to its hungry citizenry, like President Herbert Hoover's let-me-eat-cake attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cooking of his childhood, he dined like the millionaire sophisticate he had become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"He liked to eat Continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Mr. Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in almost a gold-plated dining room, wearing a dinner jacket.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was fabulously out of touch.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt may have committed the same error if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As the book tells it, Mrs. Roosevelt's hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavor resulted in a White House that "put out not only some of the dreariest food in Washington but also some of the most dismally prepared."</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the Depression-era food ways were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is in our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ms. Ziegelman said, and on the way science has been applied to cooking.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple said that in writing the book, they gained greater understanding of the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - how she couldn't throw food away, for instance.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She had a real fear of food waste," Mr. Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ms. Ziegelman recalled: "She actually got people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the cream-puff incident.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">"It's called prune whip," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a snazzy name.</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, just prunes, a little bit of flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the viscous brown goo.</seg>
<seg id="52">Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.</seg>
<seg id="53">Mr. Coe went back for seconds, and thirds.</seg>
<seg id="54">Sounding like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."</seg>

<seg id="2">Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the attorney fees it incurred related to hepatitis C patent litigation with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, a U.S. district judge has ruled.</seg>
<seg id="3">In June, Gilead was freed from paying up $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath and other unethical practices.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a filing on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to relief from the fees it incurred while defending the case.</seg>
<seg id="5">Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate</seg>
<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton brought in nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.</seg>
<seg id="4">Clinton's running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to make their tax returns public, although they are not required by law to do so.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for his refusal to release his returns.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Your move," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic nominee's returns.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his net worth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and various other ties, including with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has pounced on the issue, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting high-profile Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns," she told the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="16">Politico has reported that Trump paid zero to very little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants saying that could still be the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">Federal tax rates have become an issue in the presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Barack Obama also backs the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">At a Clinton rally last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.</seg>
<seg id="21">Buffet said that he too was under IRS audit and Trump is "afraid" not of the tax-collection agency but of voters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clinton's campaign has released tax returns going back to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Clintons' 2015 return showed that, unlike most Americans, just $100 of their income came from wages.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income of $109,000.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewish filmmaker slams Berlin hotel for removing Israel dial code after Arab "request" - RT News</seg>
<seg id="2">A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media furor after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's dial code, with employee citing "requests" from Arabic customers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, an author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German outlet FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of dial codes provided by the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="5">The country however was not mentioned among the states one can call directly from the room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible, in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?</seg>
<seg id="7">Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to dial Israel via an own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">Seeking explanation, the filmmaker addressed the issue at the hotel's reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">The answer he got there, Lanzmann wrote "shocked him."</seg>
<seg id="11">The hotel's clerk said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski-Hotels."</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason behind the move triggered even more outrage by the filmmaker.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel's code to be deleted," the employee was quoted as saying by Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case a "great shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reports.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were appalled and shocked by the incident.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is in itself a great shame.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that it has occurred in Germany and at that very hotel chain, is an even greater disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">That needs no explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">We expect that the hotel draws the right conclusions," the official said.</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered quite a response online, with people calling it a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some alleged that the Kempinski hotel simply "caved in" to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Shame on you," another post stated, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street stands near a synagogue.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hotel itself was quick to brush off any accusations, calling what happened an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying.</seg>
<seg id="25">It adds that the code was now added.</seg>

<seg id="3">Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.</seg>
<seg id="4">The trouble started when law enforcement officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="5">Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their dismay at the plans.</seg>
<seg id="6">Under proposals from the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be relocated in order to save money.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some of those taking part in the protest could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against the interim President Michel Temer.</seg>
<seg id="8">This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted for her impeachment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brits grab cycling gold</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Team GB trio defended the title from London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Glaswegian 23-year-old was in the anchor role that his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own and the youngster did the legend proud as he stormed home to snatch victory from the favoured New Zealand outfit.</seg>
<seg id="4">Britain claimed a shock victory four years ago to win as Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic golds.</seg>
<seg id="5">And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at March's Track World Championships in London, despite Hoy having since retired.</seg>
<seg id="6">The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist starter Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so just in time as Hindes emerged.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement also created a void which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man Britain's coaches stuck with, seeing potential in the Scot which has now been realised.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel for gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes was narrowly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team in front and Skinner held on.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes riding a bigger gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy watched on from his position as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stepped on to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just out there to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There's no better way to win it.</seg>
<seg id="20">After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling to the track following a poor start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later retracted the comment and there was no method of appeal from Britain's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">There was no such issue this time around in a supreme victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "It felt like London, with all the GB flags in the stand."</seg>
<seg id="24">We all as a team came together in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've been losing out on so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is just amazing.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is one event, one gold medal for the nation which won seven out of 10 track titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then a successful five days in the velodrome awaits.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Games.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also born on 23 March (that seemingly sacred date in British sport which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as Hoy's.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny next competes in the sprint, which begins on today and plays out over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one for now.</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You get to win it with your mates.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's a bit lonely winning on your own to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the day's only medal event, but there was further good news for Britain.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit.</seg>
<seg id="39">They finished in 3:51.943.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, set in winning gold at London 2012, is 3:51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first round and final (10.42pm) take place on today's second day of action, where Wiggins is sure to be the focus.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had a dispute with commissaires yesterday ahead of the qualification ride, when officials summoned him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time, clocking 4:13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">Team GB have come to rely on its mighty track cycling squad to take ownership of the middle period of an Olympic Games and deliver a host of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After truly exceptional showings of utter dominance at Beijing and London, expectations have been played down in the lead-up to Rio.</seg>
<seg id="46">There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, and the retirements of giant figures like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, on the evidence of the first night's racing in the velodrome, it looks like GB's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect time could be about to be repeated once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Portland smelter's future in doubt with axing of power contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in doubt with the power company which supplies the plant disclosing one of the plant's owners is to terminate a supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be axed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The move follows the decision of the Victoria government earlier this year to not extend subsidies provided to keep the plant in operation.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.</seg>
<seg id="6">As many as 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk with any closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">And there could be additional knock-on effects since the smelter consumes around 10 per cent of Victoria's entire electricity output.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">The moves follows speculation about the future of the plant for several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to the price for the output from the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," it said.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL said the contracts are so-called 'hedging contracts' which were due to take effect from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to earnings in fiscal year 17," the power company said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Any potential earnings impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "anticipation of a termination event."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November this year, although it has yet to explain why it has pulled out of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both of the Portland smelter in Victoria and also the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Addressing analysts earlier in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.</seg>
<seg id="23">If both of those plants go from the market that's a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.</seg>
<seg id="24">And as a generator that wouldn't be good for us," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres every year, with the sector bracing itself for the impact further funding cuts will have on already-stretched operations.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away while seeking free legal advice and representation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Community legal services, already stretched beyond limits, are bracing for further cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">From June next year, those legal centres are slated to lose another 30 per cent of their federal funding.</seg>
<seg id="6">Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres Census Report found thousands of people were already being turned away each year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they're not able to get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands more vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call on the Attorney-General, and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts, so people can get the help they need when they're faced with a legal problem.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to bring legal aid funding up to the national average.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's now time to look at the needs of community legal centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.</seg>

<seg id="2">New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the director of its North Carolina operations pulled a gun on a staffer as they drove in a Jeep in February.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be handled internally before realising "this was not going to happen."</seg>
<seg id="5">The director, Earl Phillip, "produced a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and drove the barrel into Vincent's knee cap," Bordini said in the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="6">After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experience the same thing with Phillip, according to the filing.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Guns don't have to fire to inflict damage," Bordini said in the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="8">The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furore when telling a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" -- understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and gets her pick of judges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he wasn't advocating violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bordini's complaint seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, and from Phillip for assault, battery and infliction of emotional distress.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.</seg>
<seg id="13">WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported Phillip recently left the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="14">A call left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, wasn't immediately returned.</seg>

<seg id="1">New tradition: rural community and sports festival in Kulciems.</seg>
<seg id="2">On Saturday, a community and sports festival in Kulciems gathered people for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="3">After ten years of the Lake Festival, it was decided to discontinue that tradition.</seg>
<seg id="4">A new page has thus been opened.</seg>
<seg id="5">The day starts with a sports contest.</seg>
<seg id="6">This time people did not compete in traditional disciplines and they were not to be taken seriously, because, for example, darts had to be thrown at a target placed on the ground, there was a flying boot thrown from the left hand, and no Olympic Games have ever seen something called "balling".</seg>
<seg id="7">However, each participant was given a chance to show his or her strength, courage, dexterity and wittiness.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the sports games everyone gathered near an open-air stage where the festival began.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, a "children's corner" was also available for activities and children could jump around in inflatable structures and have their faces painted in a make-up room.</seg>
<seg id="10">Another novelty, which might become a tradition, was the parade of vehicles, where both tractors and motorcycles took part.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Kulciems county local government director Inga Kadike-Skadina took the floor to wish everybody a nice rest and good weather, although there was some rain but not as heavy as to disturb the celebration.</seg>
<seg id="12">The festival continued with congratulation of the youngest residents of Kulciems.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is really nice that the county now has five young girls and one boy more.</seg>
<seg id="14">Drama groups from Engure region visited Kulciems residents with their performances: the audience really loved the performances of the senior dance group "Rudens ritmi" (Autumn Rhythms), various folk dance performers "Redas" and youth dancers "Zelta perles" (Golden Pearls).</seg>
<seg id="15">And it is not a big deal that a few feet slipped on the wet stage.</seg>
<seg id="16">Of course, the popular duo of actors, Janis Jarans and Dainis Porgans, who again transformed into Mildina Nabina and Skaidrite Kranina, as well as the exuberant ladies from Berzciems, fishermen's house Dieninas all provided a particular enjoyment for the local residents and guests.</seg>
<seg id="17">The music band "Brugis" took care about the music in the ball.</seg>

<seg id="1">Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow</seg>
<seg id="2">Heathrow will also deliver regeneration and prosperity not just in our local communities and across London, but across the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made enormous efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics achieved huge benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And, we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and firms close to Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities alone we'll create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment around the airport.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just as there were ahead of London 2012, there will be those that think the challenge of Heathrow expansion is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that Britain would be never be ready for the Games and that we would be embarrassed on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong on 2012 and they will be proved wrong on Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question asked of it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's busiest two runways.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they stand ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be too.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to channel that Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="1">Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide</seg>
<seg id="2">The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent act of suicide.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay down in the dark on the road "in a desperate act" and was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">Clearly looking to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles including a lorry.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died at the scene.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed but some are still unidentified, said police, who are calling for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.</seg>
<seg id="9">A criminal investigation has been opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However it remains to be seen if any of the drivers involved will face charges.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was it possible to avoid impact?</seg>
<seg id="12">That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hofstetter.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each case - both of which involved a person walking on the motorway in the dark - it was judged that motorists cannot expect to come across a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, said the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year a police officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Paynerne one night in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court heard.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the policewoman -- who was responding to an emergency call -- was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.</seg>

<seg id="1">Signatures are being gathered online to organize a new competition for the position of the SRS head.</seg>
<seg id="2">The petition portal Avaaz.org has begun gathering signatures for a proposal to organize a new competition in which the new head of the State Revenue Service (SRS) would be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is indicated in the petition addressed to the National Alliance (NA) and the Union of Greens and Farmers (UGF) that the society wants a transparent and professional procedure for promoting of officials.</seg>
<seg id="4">The petition was drawn up on August 10 and currently has been signed by 55 persons.</seg>
<seg id="5">Promotion of candidate for the position of Director General of SRS, Inga Kolegova, is not transparent and professional.</seg>
<seg id="6">It somehow reminds of the old bureaucratic traditions of the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="7">It discredits government as such and repeatedly disappoints the society regarding the government and politicians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"A competition with clear criteria is necessary, against which all candidates should be evaluated," the petition says.</seg>
<seg id="9">Its author Janis B pointed out that the society does not know the criteria according to which Kolegova was being promoted for the position.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is also unclear what are the candidate's intentions for working at the SRS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The petition says that the State Chancery must start a new and open competition, actively addressing professional candidates, involving recruitment specialists and offering a proper salary.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Minister for Finance, Dana Reizniece-Ozola, last week officially put forward Kolegova as a candidate for the position of the SRS head; this week it was intended to confirm her in the new position, but all ministers from Unity voted against, therefore the issue was postponed for a week.</seg>

<seg id="1">Samoilovs: Lost game means that I have underperformed.</seg>
<seg id="2">Beach volleyball players Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Janis Smedins had hoped for a medal at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, however, they missed on their goal and, consequently, once you're out of the tournament, it does not matter anymore where to finish the competition, Samoilovs told after leaving the competition.</seg>
<seg id="3">This Thursday, one of the world's strongest beach volleyball pairs lost the game against the Brazilians Evandro Goncalves Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgado in the subgroup tournament's concluding and decisive match scoring 1-2 (16-21, 22-20, 7-15) thus finishing their participation in the most important sports forum of the quadrennium.</seg>
<seg id="4">In three pool play matches the Latvian athletes got one victory but two other pairs had the same ratio.</seg>
<seg id="5">The mutual small-score ratio was considered further, which was the most adverse for the Latvian pair after the apparent loss suffered in this match.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We were winning in the 1st set, but after reaching 16-15 we remained at the score of 16," Smedins commented on the game's progress.</seg>
<seg id="7">I don't even know how we managed not to grow the score in the remaining time of the set.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just a bad example.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the 1st set everything was fine and we managed to break up the game at the set's ending, besides it had to be a firm foundation for the 3rd set .</seg>
<seg id="10">We started it similarly, but after we switched sides, the result was going up only for one team.</seg>
<seg id="11">We made too many mistakes in attacking.</seg>
<seg id="12">All pool play teams were similar, there were three sets in almost all matches therefore small-scale points were important.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We had to play more similar rather than repeatedly losing 3-4 points in a row," the athlete told.</seg>
<seg id="14">We knew that Evandro can serve.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We managed it in the 1st set, but in the 2nd set we lost 1-2 points, while in the 3rd set with +4 their game was on the way up," Smedins recalled.</seg>
<seg id="16">We tried to show our best game.</seg>
<seg id="17">At some moments we succeeded and at some we didn't.</seg>
<seg id="18">I did not look at the summary assessment of the situation before the match, but I knew that we had to have more small-scale points.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The loss means means that I have underperformed", Samoilovs concluded.</seg>
<seg id="20">We expected a good serve from Evandro and we handled it quite well during the first two sets, but in the third one his serve opened up and it was hard to counter-attack.</seg>
<seg id="21">I personally made a lot of mistakes when returning Pedro's serves, but I had to somehow manage.</seg>
<seg id="22">Samoilovs told that, unlike in the previous match, today the athletes were not as nervous.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We went and played and we had a defense, but we could be better in returning the serves," said the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="24">"They played well and in the beginning they were riding the wave."</seg>
<seg id="25">We already told right after the draw that we've picked the most difficult lot possible.</seg>
<seg id="26">We had a chance to fight for the first place but we did not manage to get past the group.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Everybody expected us to get a medal or perhaps it was our expectation, but in the end it does not matter whether you have the 25th or the 4th place," commented Samoilovs who predicted that the pair will continue playing together in the future.</seg>
<seg id="28">I think that there will be no questions and we'll go on playing as the same team, because this situation occurred only in one tournament.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games were the third Olympics for Samoilovs, since he played also in Beijing together with Martins Plavins, but four years earlier in London he joined forces with Ruslans Sorokins.</seg>
<seg id="30">Meanwhile for Smedins it was the second Olympics.</seg>

<seg id="1">Latvenergo observes the gas market liberalization process also as a potential provider.</seg>
<seg id="2">The state-owned energy company Latvernergo is observing the liberalization of the natural gas market both from a position of a consumer and a potential provider, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.</seg>
<seg id="3">"A decision on whether Latvenergo will enter the gas market in future also as a seller will be determined by the gas market model and the legal regulation that will be created."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Therefore we actively participate in the preparation of the legal basis, provide our comments and offer our proposals," Bidere said.</seg>
<seg id="5">As reported by the news agency BNS, the Ministry of Economics (ME) in cooperation with the Public Utilities Commission and the energy company Latvijas Gaze has come up with a draft Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers "Regulations on trade and use of natural gas" which will replace the existing natural gas market operation principles by granting the natural gas users a right to freely choose their natural gas supplier starting April 3, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">The goal of ME, when working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, is to make it as simple and transparent for the customer as possible.</seg>
<seg id="7">Therefore, the most efficient and user-friendly service solution is the "provider-centric model", according to which all activities related to the customer service are carried out by a single provider, which means one contract, one bill and one information channel and customer service location, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system at the operator's discretion.</seg>
<seg id="8">A similar solution is now being implemented in the electric power market.</seg>
<seg id="9">We remind that a gradual opening of the market will be applicable to households; also after April 3, 2017, those households which prefer not to choose an alternative natural gas company will be able to continue to receive natural gas from their current supplier for a regulated price thus becoming the "mandated" users.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In that case the public trader has an obligation to deliver natural gas to the mandated users at a regulated price," the ministry informed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile the economic operators will be obliged to choose a natural gas trader and sign a natural gas supply agreement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before signing the natural gas supply agreement, the economic operators will receive natural gas from the current natural gas trader for a price at its discretion, for a certain period.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft Regulation of the Cabinet of Ministers specifies in detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Regulation stipulates a procedure by which the user receives natural gas and discontinues its supply, the safety requirements in using natural gas, the rights and obligations of a trader, public trader, system operator, user and owner of the property regarding natural gas supply and use; the procedure by which payments are to be made for the services, the amount of late payment fees, the procedure for switching to another supplier and supply to users during natural gas supply disruptions; the procedure by which the public trader supplies natural gas to the mandated users.</seg>

<seg id="5">The minister also highlighted that she has no particular candidate in mind for the job.</seg>

<seg id="7">Regarding the current Acting Head of the SRS, Dace Peleka, who expressed her readiness to run for this position, the minister repeatedly said that the new Director General of the SRS should have an "impartial perspective" and he or she should not come from within SRS's ranks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Turnover of canned food manufacturer Zila laguna shrank by 33.8% last year.</seg>
<seg id="2">The turnover of the canned food manufacturer "Zila laguna" was 4.202 million euros last year, which is by 33.8% less than the year before; meanwhile, the company's losses decreased 5.7 times, down to 904.7 thousand euros, its annual financial report, published in the Lursoft data base reveals.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company's management report indicates that in 2015 the company operated at loss that was caused by several reasons, including constant lack of liquid assets - due to Unicredit Bank leaving the Baltic market and discontinuing the effective credit line, thus leaving Zila laguna with signed contracts without the possibility to fulfill them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore, the company did not have sufficient means to purchase cheaper raw materials in bulk at volume discount rates.</seg>
<seg id="5">As the bank was leaving the Latvian market, it also became impossible for the company to implement European Union Structural Funds' supported projects that would allow buying new equipment for the plant and modernize the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="6">The company's financial indicators were adversely affected also by increased prices of raw material and unwillingness of customers to pay more for the company's products.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Only in the second part of July 2016, customers accepted price changes and became willing to buy them at the new, higher prices," the company's management points out.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2015, Zila laguna started negotiations with prospective investors, including an evaluation of the company's movable and immovable property.</seg>
<seg id="9">The investors have already visited the company's largest creditor Unicredit Leasing and the parties have learned about and discussed the prospective investment plans.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the same time, the company's business and further development were positively affected by the implementation of restructuring and optimization plans started in 2014 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="11">This plan included improvement and optimization of the industrial processes permitting to increase the production output and capacity.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Several units of equipment were purchased thus ensuring higher output rate," the company's management indicated.</seg>
<seg id="13">The management of Zila laguna highlights that the equipment purchase will enable the company's factory in year 2016 to fulfil orders that were previously impossible.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first batch of production made on this equipment will be ready for delivery in August.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since letters of intent on sales of products have been already signed, all manufactured products will be sold according to the letters of intent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The new product will increase turnover by approximately 300 thousand euros per month," the company's management says.</seg>
<seg id="17">In August 2016, the company also plans to sign a cooperation contract for deliveries of processed fish products to Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 2016, "Zila laguna" has shipped its first experimental container of goods to Israel, expanded sales in Cyprus, and this September is going to sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">As a result of all aforesaid activities, the company hopes to increase its turnover.</seg>
<seg id="20">In 2014, Zila laguna operated with a turnover of 6.347 million euros and incurred losses of 5.113 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="21">Zila laguna was established in 1997 and its equity capital is 1.156 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Insurer pays compensation to the passengers of a flight that was cancelled at the airport on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2">The insurance company If has paid travel insurance compensation to a family for the flight that was cancelled at the Riga Airport on Wednesday, August 10, due to which they had to abandon their plans for attending a music festival.</seg>
<seg id="3">A customer had submitted an indemnity application to If on August 11.</seg>
<seg id="4">The family had planned to attend a music festival in Belgium but since it was not possible due to flight cancellations at the airport, the customer had the compensation calculated for hotel booking, which had not been possible to cancel, as well as for the festival tickets costing 204 euros.</seg>
<seg id="5">The airline promised customers to refund money spent on their tickets.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 15% of travel insurance indemnity cases the insurance company If has paid a compensation for disruption or cancellation of trips.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In such situations the costs of flight ticket purchase, returning or change as well as hotel booking are reimbursed," explained Dagnija Rutka, Personal Risk Insurance product manager of the insurance company If.</seg>
<seg id="8">As already known, in the evening of August 10, a private plane stopped on the runway of Riga Airport due to technical reasons, and therefore several outgoing flights were canceled and several incoming flights had to be redirected to other airports.</seg>

<seg id="1">Due to repair works, a neighbor's ceiling crumbles and makes him leave home.</seg>
<seg id="2">The LTV program The 4th Studio was addressed by Dmitrijs Saidjasevs, whose neighbor had started an overhaul in his apartment and since then Dmitrijs' apartment ceiling's plaster started to crumble and fall down, so he wasn't sure whether it was safe to stay there.</seg>
<seg id="3">The problem is that my neighbors carried out unauthorized construction and the ceiling in my apartment is now damaged.</seg>
<seg id="4">Then I informed the Riga Construction Board, my building manager and other organizations.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Construction Board answered that they are not an emergency service and they do not have any experts.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The apartment owner is supposed to go to the Association of Civil Engineers of Latvia and there will be an expert," Dmitrijs tells.</seg>
<seg id="7">The invited expert came, made a record of the situation and concluded that the overhead cover is in unsatisfactory condition.</seg>
<seg id="8">But a month has passed since Dimitrijs' first application to the Construction Board and by the beginning of this week no one was able to answer, whether it is dangerous to stay in the apartment.</seg>
<seg id="9">They said, at the Construction Board: that is the law, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council but they referred the case to the building manager, then the building manager referred it back to the Construction Board and now we're in a dead-end," Dmitrijs tells.</seg>
<seg id="11">After considering the pile of documents it is clear that the construction works have been suspended even, though every now and then one can hear that somebody is working there.</seg>
<seg id="12">An expert evaluation must be carried out within two months and the owner of the apartment under repair must improve the situation within six months.</seg>
<seg id="13">The external expert has developed his opinion, but the Construction Board considers it to be incomplete and superficial.</seg>
<seg id="14">The expert has not indicated, whether the metal grid that is integrated in the bearing structure has been affected, therefore it is not certain whether the owner of the apartment below is really in danger.</seg>
<seg id="15">"For that reason we have requested additional explanation from the expert," the Riga City Council Construction Board representative Ilze Zuka tells.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of the prohibition on any repair works in the upper apartment, one can still hear that the construction goes on.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unwarranted construction without a construction permit can be fined with a penalty from 70 to 700 euro, but in this particular case the penalty might be more severe.</seg>
<seg id="18">While the expert is preparing his opinion, the Construction Board has made a decision that both apartments cannot be used: both the one where the construction works take place and Dmitrijs'.</seg>
<seg id="19">"This is an unprecedented case in the Construction Board's practice, when in such a way due to ignorance or simply unwillingness the residents probably have posed a threat not only to their property, but also to the owner living beneath and therefore this owner cannot use his property," the representative of the Construction Board tells.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now Dmitrijs has to look for another place to live: with his relatives, friends, a hotel or to rent another apartment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Or, Dmitrijs can try to recover the losses from the neighbor in civil proceedings, which may take a lot of time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Due to unwarranted construction it is prohibited now to enter both apartments until a construction engineer provides his opinion, which could last up to three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="23">The owner of the flat under repair will be liable to reimburse for the losses.</seg>
<seg id="24">The owner is also facing up to six months in prison, because he has not taken into account the warning of the Construction Board.</seg>

<seg id="1">Transformation of former Kemeri spa resort into five star hotel will cost 22 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2">A transformation of the former Kemeri spa resort into a five star festival "Park Hotel Kemeri" will cost 22 million euros, the manager of the prospective hotel and representative of limited-liability company Park Hotel Kemeri, Gita Zelve, told LETA.</seg>
<seg id="3">The development of a hotel is the first stage of the former resort's reconstruction project in Kemeri.</seg>
<seg id="4">The second stage will involve wellness clinics, intended to be opened in 2022, while opening of the hotel is scheduled for 2018.</seg>
<seg id="5">Zelve notes that accurate expenses for developing the clinic are not known yet.</seg>
<seg id="6">But she points out that it will be located in the building of the former Kemeri resort health center whose floor area is about 12,000 square meters .</seg>
<seg id="7">The clinic will be situated on three floors.</seg>
<seg id="8">Park Hotel Kemeri and the clinic project is owned by the international foundation G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.</seg>
<seg id="9">G Capital Europe belongs to several investors who invest their money in this foundation, Zelve indicates.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to George Jones, Executive Director of "G Capital Europe", it is planned to invest 12 to 15 million euros in setting up the health center in the former resort, with the total investment exceeding 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">As reported, the Jurmala City Council plans to attract 14.5 million euros with three to four million euros co-funding for the recovery of more than 42 hectares of historic park area, reconstruction of access roads and street sections, construction of an interactive nature tourism object, landscaping and amenities, as well as construction of car parking lots in Emils Darzins Street which altogether will promote the socioeconomic development of Jurmala and increase the number of tourists.</seg>
<seg id="12">The designing phase is intended to take place until mid-2017, while construction and area development works are to start next autumn.</seg>
<seg id="13">As reported, it is planned to develop a five-star hotel Park Hotel Kemeri and wellness clinics at the historical health resort complex Kemeri.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nevertheless, the reconstruction kept being postponed.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was stated in the annual report of 2010 that Ominasis maintained regular communication with the hotel group Kempinski, which continues providing routine technical supervision at the Kemeri resort and that in 2011 the "reconstruction of the new hotel Kemeri would be finished", immediately followed by preparations for opening the Kempinski's chain hotel.</seg>
<seg id="16">In October 2014, Park Hotel Kemeri expressed willingness to purchase a group of properties of the Kemeri health resort, owned by the insolvent Omnasis Latvia, in auction, but one month later the auction was declared invalid, because the winner did not pay for the purchase at the agreed time.</seg>
<seg id="17">The price was determined according to the initial price of the invalid auction, at 2.86 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="18">As LETA was informed by a City Council representative Ieva Aile, the municipality has confirmed by signing a protocol that it is going to improve the adjacent infrastructure: restore the historic Kemeri park, create an interactive nature tourism object, repair roads and car parking lots, with co-financing from the European Union structural funds.</seg>

<seg id="1">E-mail of former NATO commander Breedlove was hacked by Russian hackers.</seg>
<seg id="2">The hackers, who broke into the US Democratic National Committee's computers, allegedly made several other cyber attacks as well as hacked the e-mail account of Philip Breedlove, the ex-Commander of NATO's European Forces as well as the servers of George Soros' Institute "Open Society", business news agency Bloomberg reported on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The hackers have published the extracted information on the website DCLeaks.com.</seg>
<seg id="4">Also Breedlove's correspondence and information about Soros Institute's work have been placed there.</seg>
<seg id="5">The institute's computers had been accessible to hackers for one year.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to data provided by Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers related to Russian secret services as those hacking the DNC e-mail system.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Wall Street Journal in its turn reports that the Administration of US President Barrack Obama is currently working on the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia thus reacting to the hacking of the DNC computers.</seg>
<seg id="8">In order to introduce sanctions, the Administration will have to officially accuse Russia or hackers supported by the Russian authorities for the cyber attacks against the Democratic Party's servers.</seg>
<seg id="9">As reported, in July the website WikiLeaks published approximately 20,000 e-mail letters obtained from the DNC computer system and it can be deduced from them that the leaders of the Democratic Party have put in an effort to damage the campaign of Vermont's senator, Bernie Sanders, the former rival of the party's candidate Hillary Clinton, who is struggling for the democrats' nomination to run for president.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to US press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the case of hacking the Democrats' server, and also other US seecurity services believe that Russia's connection to the cyber attack is almost indubitable.</seg>

<seg id="2">Paul McCartney has admitted that the presence of Yoko Ono made the legendary band The Beatles feel jeopardized.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 74 year old rock star ''maintains'' good relations with the widow of John Lennon, but back when she came to visit the band in the recording studio, McCartney was afraid of her, because she was the only woman in the company of the band members George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Lennon and McCartney.</seg>
<seg id="4">When the singer was asked about the relationships between them, he told to Rolling Stone that "they are really good."</seg>
<seg id="5">Back then we felt threatened.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sat on the amplifier while we were recording.</seg>
<seg id="7">The majority of the band could not stand it.</seg>
<seg id="8">We managed, but not very well as we were stressed out.</seg>
<seg id="9">We weren't sexists but girls usually did not come to the recording studio, they'd let us do our thing.</seg>
<seg id="10">When John started to hang out with Yoko, she sat among the four of us, not in the sound engineer's room.</seg>
<seg id="11">The author of the hit song Yellow Submarine also admitted that he now regularly communicates with Ringo, the former band member, and occasionally approves the work plans of the recording studio Apple, but in other terms The Beatles have ceased to exist.</seg>
<seg id="12">When asked, whether he still meets the other remaining member of the legendary rock group, McCartney revealed to Rolling Stone: "not very often".</seg>
<seg id="13">We meet at social events and parties.</seg>
<seg id="14">I do not go to meetings, I feel somehow disassociated from that.</seg>
<seg id="15">I left Apple during my complicated divorce.</seg>

<seg id="1">NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable</seg>
<seg id="2">Venus was likely once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests Venus could have boasted a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet likely featured more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and guard against rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent dimmer.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus' slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Though likely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Venus we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of a voice within the team's decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="3">Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and noted that the club will begin a search for a new coach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="4">"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">I have thought long and hard over the course of the summer about how I might improve this team to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="6">To achieve this, the vision of the coach and VP-hockey operations needs to be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="7">He must also have a say in the decisions that impact the team's performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">These conditions are not currently met.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.</seg>
<seg id="11">We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's best coach during his rookie season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.</seg>
<seg id="13">He guided the club to 112 points and a first-place finish in the Central Division, but Colorado was upset by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has missed the postseason in each of the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in 2015-16 and fell five points shy of the Wild for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference.</seg>

<seg id="2">Labor strikes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, lead negotiators said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm we have agreed to restart the process for resolution of the current dispute," a joint statement read.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will hold a number of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.</seg>
<seg id="6">The labor unions said their recent action, which they said is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest of potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wood Group this year cut rates paid to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent because of negative market pressures.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company's rate reduction follows a 10 percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said additional cuts would give the company the room needed to move through the market downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shell, for its part, has trimmed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.</seg>
<seg id="11">Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation compounded by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes to strike the North Sea in a generation.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Pleiades cluster is situated 445 light-years from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching adulthood, having been born roughly 125 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">They're spinning as fast as they ever will.</seg>
<seg id="8">At their peak spin rates, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel across the stars' magnetic fields, they enact a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a star ages, its spin rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures each star's spin rate by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots -- like sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalog of spin rates suggests more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull likens the stars to dancers, larger ones pirouetting more slowly than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities with spin rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation going both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">We still have a lot we want to learn about how, when and why stars slow their spin rates and hang up their 'dance shoes,' so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades spin rates in three new papers, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>
