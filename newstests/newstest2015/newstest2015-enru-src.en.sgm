<seg id="1">FANO Russia will hold a final Expert Session</seg>
<seg id="2">The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO Russia), in joint cooperation with RAS, will hold the third Expert Session on “Evaluating the effectiveness of activities of scientific organizations”.</seg>
<seg id="3">The gathering will be the final one in a series of meetings held by the agency over the course of the year, reports a press release delivered to the editorial offices of Lenta.ru.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the third meeting, it is planned that the results of the work conducted by the Expert Session over the past year will be presented and that a final checklist to evaluate the effectiveness of scientific organizations will be developed.</seg>
<seg id="5">In addition, participants at the event plan to discuss the rules for forming an expert panel, which is responsible for evaluating the work of scientific groups, as well as the criteria for carrying out evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="6">The third Expert Session will be the final meeting in a series of events on the formation of a unified approach for all three academies to the evaluation of the effectiveness of activities of scientific organizations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the past five months, we were able to achieve this, and the final version of the regulatory documents is undergoing approval.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the plans for the upcoming session, we should complete the development of procedures for scientometric and expert analysis, and come to an agreement on the stages and timeframes for the evaluation process”, said the Head of FANO’s Expert-Analytical Department, Elena Aksenova.</seg>
<seg id="9">Representatives from more than one hundred Russian scientific institutes will take part in the event.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is expected that a resolution will be adopted based on its results.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scientists have found a way to detect related stars</seg>
<seg id="2">Astrophysicists from the University of California, Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is expected that the experts’ discovery will make it possible to search for stars that are related to one another, that is to say, those stars that emerged from the same cluster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The authors published the results of their study in the journal, Nature, but one can briefly get acquainted with them on the university’s website.</seg>
<seg id="5">The reason for the homogeneous chemical composition of adjacent stars turns out to be turbulent mixing in the gas clouds where stars are created.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even if the newly formed star later leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition will make it possible to determine its place of birth and the region where related stars were formed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside of a cluster could result in differences in its chemical composition compared to related stars in a cluster.</seg>
<seg id="8">The results of the simulations conducted by the astrophysicists prove that such differences should not occur.</seg>
<seg id="9">The experts used a supercomputer in their research to simulate two streams of interstellar gas, which combined to form a cloud.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over the course of several million years and under the force of its own gravitational pull, the object turned into a cluster, in which protostars began to form.</seg>
<seg id="11">The scientists added indicating dye to the original gas streams and determined that the high level of chemical homogeneity was a result of the fast turbulent mixing in the cloud.</seg>
<seg id="12">The astrophysicists believe that their study proves that it’s possible to look for related stars on the basis of chemical composition, as well as to determine the possible regions where these objects were formed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russia will not “slam the door” in the face of new sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was stated by the head of Russia’s MFA, Sergei Lavrov, while speaking in front of students and faculty members at MGIMO University.</seg>
<seg id="4">I won't even expound on or indulge in fantastical thinking about our counter measures in the event of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, because everything should be specifically calculated, he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">And when we understand what our European and American partners are worthy of this time around, that is when we will make a decision about how to respond.</seg>
<seg id="6">It will not be connected with door slamming, or some falsely understood grievances, the minister emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="7">We, first and foremost, will be guided by our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business sector, and we will draw conclusions from our partners’ actions on the basis of their appropriateness, ability to come to an agreement, and reliability.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the basis of the steps that have been taken in the area of sanctions, it’s possible to soundly judge what our partners are trying to accomplish”, the head of the Russian MFA continued.</seg>
<seg id="9">If they are shouting at the top of their lungs that ‘they will also be sanctions for us, but we have to take such measures in order to punish Russia’, this is probably not very appropriate.”</seg>
<seg id="10">As far as Russia’s leaving the WTO in response to potential new sanctions is concerned, the answer is no.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the contrary, we want to more actively master the WTO instruments, including when the issue concerns trade disagreements, Lavrov stated.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have already used this instrument in order to overcome what we see as discriminatory policies by the EU in the area of antidumping procedures.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the minister, Russia has been accused of dumping, and, as such, antidumping measures have been taken against sectors of the Russian economy.</seg>
<seg id="14">“We are also prepared to use WTO mechanisms in order to defend our position against introducing the norms of the EU’s third energy package retroactively”, Lavrov said.</seg>

<seg id="4">They fit very nicely with many plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moreover, one can and should plant lilacs beside both plants that bloom at different times and those that bloom at the same time as it.</seg>
<seg id="6">Another bonus of lilacs is that they offer so many opportunities to get creative.</seg>

<seg id="1">Reconnecting With the Very American Ideal That Labor Rights Are Human Rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"As go unions, so go middle-class jobs," says Ellison, the Minnesota Democrat who serves as a Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's why I'm proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act with civil rights icon John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This ground-breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti-union forces in their tracks</seg>
<seg id="6">Amending the National Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for engaging in union organizing to sue for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compensatory and punitive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the cosponsors of their legislation are proposing is as a reconnection with a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the battering that unions have taken in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to embrace, extend and respect labor rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, within the living memory of millions of Americans, when this country championed democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize in the same breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that Hideki Tojo's militarized autocracy would be replaced with democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan, they included language that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize and to bargain and act collectively is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides urged the Germans to write a constitution that would assure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced with muscular democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers would need to organize and make their voices heard in the new nation, the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared: "The right to form associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or profession.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to impair this right shall be null and void; measures directed to this end shall be unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that would in 1948 be adopted by the United Nations as a global covenant, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">For generations, Americans accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country counseled other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, with those rights under assault in America, it is wise, indeed, to recommit to the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not diminish the strength of the nation but enlarged it.</seg>
<seg id="23">By raising the living standards of millions, labor miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to undreamed of levels of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack labor forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers, as should we.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing ideals that have historically enlarged America and made real the promise of democracy.</seg>

<seg id="2">A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked enforcement of a Louisiana law that advocates say would likely have closed all five abortion clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">The measure, signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and due to take effect Sept. 1, would require doctors who perform abortions to have patient admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the judge's ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while seeking such privileges.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Plaintiffs will be allowed to operate lawfully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in the decision.</seg>
<seg id="6">A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Abortion rights activists applauded the decision, the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privileges.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's ruling ensures Louisiana women are safe from an underhanded law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued to block the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the suit and have also applied for admitting privileges.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently ruling unconstitutional such measures in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of a Texas law that would have shuttered most remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abortion rights campaigners, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admitting privileges laws impose medically unnecessary requirements on doctors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anti-abortion advocates have countered that the measures aim to protect women's health, though some have also lauded their effect of shuttering clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admitting privileges, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, that doctor, fearful for his safety, would stop carrying out the procedure, the group said.</seg>
<seg id="16">In arguing against the ruling, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors performing abortions while their applications for admitting privileges were pending.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will be the effect of the introduction of quotas on domestic goods</seg>
<seg id="2">No less than half of goods of every kind of item available in retail chain stores should be made in Russia, reckons State Duma Deputy, Oleg Nilov, from the, A Just Russia, faction.</seg>
<seg id="3">The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protectionist measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still undergo revision to avoid negative impacts on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="5">It concerns goods that are not manufactured in Russia […]. For other types of goods, those that are manufactured in Russia, retailers will be obliged to make no less than half of their shelves available to domestic producers”, Nilov informed the publication.</seg>
<seg id="6">Along with amendments to the law “On the basis of state regulation of commercial activity in the Russian Federation,” the bill requires the introduction of changes to the tax code, by decreasing the VAT rate to 10% upon the sale of goods produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota in retail chain stores is part of a package of stimulus measures for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The amount of domestic goods that will appear on store shelves will increase severalfold.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the initiative may have both a positive and negative effect, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Sergei Litvinenko, lawyer for the company, Nalogovik, and a member of Public Duma, an independent expert centre, the effect on the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and the food industries, will be positive and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Agricultural producers, farmers, and small stores stand to gain.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and that means that their profits will increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, they will receive the right to dictate their prices and conditions to retailers, since retailers will be obliged to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian producers will be able to increase the scope of their operations and the volume of their sales, which will result in the payment of higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">This will increase fiscal revenues and create new jobs, certain industries will start to expand, some will find their feet faster than others, and it will contribute to GDP growth.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia’s dependence on foreign foodstuffs will decline severalfold, but, of course, not immediately”, the expert notes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Previously, Russian businesses were frequently unable to get their goods onto the shelves of local stores as a result of the high level of competition from foreign competitors.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche has been freed up and it’s possible to breathe a little more easily.</seg>
<seg id="19">But it shouldn’t be forgotten that, after all of the necessary agreements and sanitary inspections have been completed, food commodities produced in Latin America, Turkey, and Serbia will hit the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, a "moment of calm" is at hand, when the previous players have already left, and the new ones haven’t yet arrived.</seg>
<seg id="21">After almost a month, it is possible to talk about an increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as higher prices on finished products”, Tamara Kasyanova (PhD Econ.), First Vice-President of the All-Russian Public Organization, Russian Club of Financial Directors, told AiF.ru.</seg>
<seg id="22">Without a doubt, the idea of selling a minimum of 50% of Russian food products in every category will make it possible to secure this sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In this case, they will be competing with each other, and not with goods that cost less as a result of subsidies from a different state.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, competition for consumers will take place between companies that are doing business according to the same industry laws.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian producers are far from being able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of their compatriots in all respects.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in a situation like this, retail chain stores will have to “strive” to ensure that at least half of their product assortment is comprised of Russian goods.</seg>
<seg id="27">Accordingly, there is a growing fear that poor quality products will find their way onto store shelves.</seg>
<seg id="28">It’s possible that foreign goods that are relabelled to make them appear as if they were made in Russia will be supplied”, the expert added.</seg>
<seg id="29">Large retail chains will feel a negative effect from the introduction of quotas, especially those who find it advantageous to collaborate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that, in a situation like this, foreign suppliers themselves will also suffer, since demand for their products will decrease.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko doesn’t discount that the law on quotas could also have an impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some Russian-produced goods may be of a lower quality than their imported equivalents, and, as such, stores may jack up the price of the latter products, as if they were scarce commodities.</seg>
<seg id="33">Import substitution, an idea that had been forgotten about since the beginning of the 2000s, was once again being talked about by economists in February of this year, as a result of the relentless devaluation of the rouble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of renouncing imported goods is becoming ever more relevant.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law is intended to require retailers to reckon with domestic producers when placing orders with suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="36">In this way, we will be on the road to import substitution much more quickly and with greater confidence, and a system for planning the production of essential types of goods will be created in a shorter period of time”, says Deputy Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="37">The quota mechanism will be especially effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly great, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports amounted to 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are entirely capable of wholly filling the shelves of Russian stores.</seg>
<seg id="39">More over, meat production could also receive a powerful boost.</seg>
<seg id="40">As is well known, beef maintains the highest import rate – from 30 to 35%.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that 65-70% still comes from Russian output”, Kasyanova reasons.</seg>
<seg id="42">Experts support the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic goods will contribute to import substitution and may accelerate the process.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, this one initiative on it’s own will not give rise to import substitution, considering that a whole set of measures is needed for that, Litvinenko is certain.</seg>
<seg id="44">In any case, this initiative still allows for 50% of goods sold to be imported from abroad, and that means that wholesale import substitution will not take place, but a significant step in that direction will be accomplished.</seg>
<seg id="45">After all, it’s not enough to establish quotas; we also need to get the production of domestic goods in this country back on track in order to fulfil those quotas.</seg>
<seg id="46">These quotas will in fact provide such guarantees”, the expert asserts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their late mother who died of Ovarian cancer in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="3">Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their city counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="4">Researchers analysed medical records of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding just 35 per cent lived for five years after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lead researcher Susan Jordan, of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, said those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">SMALL STUDY: New drugs may slow lung, ovarian cancer</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers tracked the women's medical journeys across seven years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Dr Jordan said a woman's age at the time of diagnosis, ovarian cancer type, having existing illnesses and socio-economic status also impacted on survival chances.</seg>
<seg id="9">Older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the poorest survival rates.</seg>
<seg id="10">Those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr Jordan suggested delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment might be factors.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncology surgeons and they're mostly based in major cities," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite improving tele-medicine services to lessen the tyranny of distance, she suggested more fly-in, fly-out services to allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people in treatment away from their communities could help.</seg>
<seg id="14">Dr Jordan said regardless of geographical status, the study found long-term survival among women with ovarian cancer was poor, reinforcing the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.</seg>
<seg id="15">The research, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.</seg>
<seg id="16">In March 2012, at 33 years of age, young Gold Coast mum Elisha Neave was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inflation has returned from vacation.</seg>
<seg id="2">Will Russian citizens feel a sharp rise in prices</seg>
<seg id="3">Inflation in Russia will accelerate and exceed the government’s earlier forecast, as a result of reciprocal sanctions between Russia and the West, analysts from VTB Capital are convinced.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the delayed ramifications of the anti-sanctions will lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, RBC Daily writes.</seg>
<seg id="5">As per the most recent forecast from the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, inflation in 2014 will amount to 6.5-7.5%, and will be even less next year, at 6.5%.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to information from Kommersant newspaper, the MEDT is supposed to make “small, but fundamental” corrections to its macroeconomic forecast up until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication’s information, the agency may lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will make it possible to eliminate the expected zero-growth in household incomes.</seg>
<seg id="8">The forecast assumed that Russia’s sanctions on food commodities would last for one year, up until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">How was it possible to anticipate such high inflation in a situation like this?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation suggests a one-time shock, but the overall downward trend in inflation remains unchanged,” claims the newspaper’s source in the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government’s financial economic bloc regarding inflation, and forecast an increase in prices of around 8% in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main impact of the food bans will come into effect at the same time as the possible introduction, in 2015, of a sales tax throughout the Russian Federation, experts are convinced.</seg>
<seg id="13">An inflationary peak of 9% will come in February, after which the annual rate of inflation will start to fall, experts suggest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Incidentally, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflation data since Russia introduced its “measured sanctions”.</seg>
<seg id="15">AiF.ru polled the experts and found out what their expectations are for inflation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Deev, Head of the Analytical Department at the financial company, AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">A rise in prices can already be seen within the core segment of goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when socially significant goods started to increase in price, the government was forced to enact measures for the systematic monitoring of price stability in order to avert the risk of an unreasonable increase in prices in the short-term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers are already reporting to regulatory agencies on a daily basis so that the authorities know precisely who is triggering a rise in prices, when it is happening, and on what grounds.</seg>
<seg id="20">The colossal rate of capital flight, the exorbitant refinancing of the Russian banking sector by Russia’s mega-regulator, domestic conversion as a result of the population’s run on foreign currency, as well as the embargo on the import of foodstuffs from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia, continue to be key factors in the rising consumer price index.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures had remained under control, then the cost for the minimum basket of goods would not have jumped by 12% in just one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">The embargo on the import of foodstuffs provoked a supply shock on the internal market and led to an entirely rational increase in final costs.</seg>
<seg id="23">Since, at this stage, we will not be able to fully implement an import substitution plan or increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, reciprocal sanctions will continue to carry a risk of increasing inflationary elements.</seg>
<seg id="24">If we then include fiscal factors associated with the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the worsening prospects for economic growth, then by the end of this year, inflation could very well exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Aleksandr Razuvaev, Director of the Analytical Department at Alpari</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% a month, and, in the 2000s, it was still higher than the current level, but this was quite a different matter given that inflation was offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think that by the end of the year, inflation will be at 8-8.5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Platon Maguta, Asset Manager for Maguta Fund management company</seg>
<seg id="29">The external factor, connected with the sanctions against Russia, has so far been contained, but if further pressure is applied, most critically, to the financial sector, then it could lead to significant difficulties and increase the public’s inflationary expectations, which usually, and traditionally, manifest in the purchase of foreign exchange cash in order to safeguard one’s savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">One can expect that the government, the Russian Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance will attempt to mitigate the continuous weakening of the rouble by using market measures and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally start to rise after the summer lull, and it is possible that this fall it will become even more perceptible.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of 7.5% for consumer inflation in Russia will likely stand, given that the Russian Federation still has financial savings at its disposal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The drop, coupled with a particular decline in the number of homeowners aged under 35, could result in garden centres losing out on tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the "core gardening age group," according to the HTA's study, which was reported by the Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the report, people renting properties spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that those with their own homes spend on their gardens.</seg>
<seg id="4">It cited the rise in people living in highly urbanised areas with no gardens, the popularity of paving over front gardens for parking and shrinking garden size as other factors threatening the industry, which is worth an estimated £5 billion in sales each year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Greater London, where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, has Britain's lowest spend per household on gardening products.</seg>
<seg id="6">The HTA and Royal Horticultural Society said that renting property or a lack of garden space did not mean people could not grow plants.</seg>
<seg id="7">Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser to the RHS, said: "Container gardening, for example, is especially popular with renters who can move their plants when they relocate."</seg>
<seg id="8">The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the garden retail sector's 'golden age" as a result of increased home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to mid-1990s.</seg>
<seg id="9">It also predicted an improved market this year due to better weather following unfavourable conditions in March and April last year.</seg>

<seg id="1">The largest Chinese companies have joined forces against Alibaba</seg>
<seg id="2">Chinese companies, including the largest developer of commercial real estate in China, Dalian Wanda Group, and the Internet giants, Tencent Holdings (social media, messenger, and others) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online retail market with Alibaba.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it won’t be easy to catch up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has already surpassed even its American competitors – eBay and Amazon.com.</seg>
<seg id="4">Union of the largest</seg>
<seg id="5">The companies plan to invest 5 bln. yuan ($814 mln.) into their joint venture, of which 70% will belong to Wanda and 15% will belong to each of the Internet companies, a statement by Wanda Group says.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is planned to register the firm in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="7">The joint venture will combine the search services of Baidu with Tencent’s popular social platform, WeChat (the largest social media site in China, with close to 438 mln. users), and Wanda’s infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to its chain of 40 fashionable hotels, the Wanda Group controls a minimum of 49 commercial real estate facilities throughout China and 40 shopping centres.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, the company invested 50 bln. yuan (more than $8 bln.) into the construction of a film studio and a theme park in Qingdao (a city in the east of China on the coast of the Yellow Sea).</seg>
<seg id="10">It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 mln. visitors every year and turn a profit of approximately $960 mln.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to this, Wanda owns the American AMC Entertainment Holdings movie theatre chain, making the company the largest movie theatre operator in the world.</seg>
<seg id="12">By 2015, Wanda plans to outfit all of its shopping centres, hotels, and recreational facilities with e-commerce services, the development of which Alibaba, now established as a competitor, will also be engaged in.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Dun Tse, who heads the new company, as a result of the merger, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users for its e-commerce services from the current 40 mln. individuals to already 100 mln. by next year.</seg>
<seg id="14">The new framework should become the largest online-to-offline platform in the world, notes Dun Tse.</seg>
<seg id="15">The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract online buyers to go to regular off-line stores or buy other traditional services.</seg>
<seg id="16">A classic example of O2O includes coupon retail services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.</seg>
<seg id="17">“O2O – is the largest ‘pie’ in online commerce”, stated Chair of Wanda, Wang Jianlin (quoted in Bloomberg).</seg>
<seg id="18">“Currently, no real O2O platform exists in China, and, in a situation like this, everyone’s chances are pretty much equal”, he believes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Chinese Internet sales market is the largest in the world, and, according to an analysis by McKinsey & Co., its value will grow threefold by 2015 in comparison to 2011, up to $395 bln.</seg>
<seg id="20">The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 mln., information that Bloomberg cites from the official statistics, which is larger than the population of any country in the world, except India.</seg>
<seg id="21">Furthermore, according to forecasts, by 2015 this number already may rise to 850 mln. people.</seg>
<seg id="22">Union of the richest</seg>
<seg id="23">Until recently, the Head of Tencent, Ma Huateng, was the wealthiest person in China, however, according to Bloomberg’s index of millionaires, the founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, has already surpassed him by $5.5 bln.</seg>
<seg id="24">Jack Ma’s wealth is valued at $21.8 bln., $11 bln. of which can be attributed to his share of Alibaba.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Head of Baidu, Robin Lee, currently holds third place among the wealthiest people in China, with Wang Jianlin in the fourth spot on the ranking.</seg>
<seg id="26">“It’s really interesting to follow this battle: three of the wealthiest people joining efforts to through down the gauntlet to an even wealthier person,” the Director of the Chinese E-Commerce Research Centre in Hangzhou, Cao Lei, told Bloomberg.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he doubts that the new company will be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately following its creation: “Rome wasn’t built in a day”.</seg>
<seg id="28">The fact that Alibaba is not so easy to compete with, not only for new companies, but also for established leaders in global e-commerce, is confirmed by the report published yesterday on Alibaba’s finances for the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="29">Alibaba is often described as something in between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both American companies combined.</seg>
<seg id="30">Alibaba’s net profits for the period are almost twice as high as the similarly summarized figures of their competitors – it rose almost threefold on an annualized basis and amounted to $1.99 bln.</seg>
<seg id="31">“Alibaba still holds huge potential to generate money, thanks, in great part, to its mobile apps,” an analyst from Hong Kong’s Arete Research Service commented in the Bloomberg report.</seg>
<seg id="32">According to Alibaba’s updated prospectus on the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s website, there were 188 mln. active users of the company’s mobile services in July, which substantially exceeds its figures for March (163 mln. people).</seg>
<seg id="33">Moreover, 32.8% of all of Alibaba’s transactions over the past quarter were made through mobile apps.</seg>
<seg id="34">Alibaba will have to set the price of its shares ahead of its IPO.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the average estimate of 11 analysts polled by Bloomberg, the company may be valued at $187 bln. after the sale of its shares.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to the information of Bloomberg’s sources, Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may happen already on September 16.</seg>
<seg id="37">The company’s roadshow ahead of this event will commence on September 3.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is anticipated that Alibaba’s IPO will set an all-time record on the NYSE and will enable the company to attract around $20 bln.</seg>
<seg id="39">Until now, the record for the largest volume of investment attracted to a US stock exchange belonged to Visa payment system, which first offered its stocks in 2008, making $17.9 bln. on the deal.</seg>

<seg id="4">The goal of the document is to introduce protectionist measures for Russian producers of foodstuffs.</seg>
<seg id="5">An important specification, according to the bill, is that no less than 50 percent of every type of good in stores must be domestically produced.</seg>

<seg id="3">A further 5mm of rain fell on the city in the evening up to 9pm, following the 6.6mm that fell overnight on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The latest rain came courtesy of a couple of short, blustery showers, including a burst that started just before 8pm that dumped almost 4mm in about 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="5">After winter delivered an early dose of spring last week, temperatures dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The squally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.</seg>
<seg id="7">The plane was scheduled to land just after 7.30pm but was hit by windshear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out.</seg>
<seg id="8">Wind gusts were reaching about 50km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.</seg>
<seg id="9">Flight data showed the plane had to pull out of second landing and the plane eventually touched down about 8.40pm.</seg>
<seg id="10">That flight's delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.</seg>

<seg id="3">An expert council on the development of competition in the sphere of construction has been created within the AMS.</seg>
<seg id="4">At a meeting, the Head of the Department for the Control of Housing and Public Utilities, Construction, and Natural Resources of the AMS, Vadim Solovev, stated that “the current method for calculating budgets for construction projects is absolutely incomprehensible”.</seg>
<seg id="5">The regulatory framework makes the determination of prices non-transparent and could lead to unsubstantiated construction costs, the AMS reckons.</seg>
<seg id="6">They are suggesting that construction costs for government-owned facilities should be determined at the design stage on the basis of market prices for design concepts instead of the currently employed estimate standards and unit costs for operations.</seg>
<seg id="7">These proposals have been formulated as a “road map”, which is currently under consideration by the Ministry of Construction.</seg>
<seg id="8">“The replacement of traditional cost estimating documents in construction with calculations of structural components should lead to less corruption in the industry, Vadim Solovev explained to RGB.</seg>
<seg id="9">After all, right now every bolt and nut is calculated into the estimate, and it’s not always possible to check it all, and, as such, every now and then, unethical construction companies can bury “a whole tractor” in the documents.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ministry of Construction is in agreement with the AMS.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The first achievements in the transition to cost calculations of structural components are now ready: methodologies for calculating costs for design concepts and the budgeting process using these indicators have been developed”, the Head of the Department for City Construction Activities and architect with the Ministry of Construction, Elena Zhukova, told RGB.</seg>
<seg id="12">The road construction industry has been chosen to pilot the project.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, experts consider that the problem is much more serious.</seg>
<seg id="14">As the Head of Profi-Invest construction company, Anatoly Demyanko, told RGB, the estimate norms have been out of date for quite some time, but no other mechanism has been offered to businesses thus far.</seg>
<seg id="15">“As for the proposed cost calculation of structural components, it will be difficult to implement in practise, since the construction of buildings often requires the use of totally different technologies”, he declares.</seg>
<seg id="16">It’s no secret that the construction industry is developing in large part thanks to state contracts.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Ekaterina Lezina, Chair of the Board for the NPO, Expert Community of State Contract Professionals, right now, the state is the most solvent client.</seg>
<seg id="18">Vladimir Malakhov, Deputy Director of Engineering at the Industry Expertise Centre for Capital Projects at Rosatom, drew attention to the fact that today’s market is basically divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and those companies that possess a monopolistic area of expertise and refuse to let any competitors into that field.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible under the condition that access to contracts will be fully protected from somebody else’s control.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the Expert Council, it was proposed that the system of government orders be set up so that the same contractor would not be allowed to receive more than one contract valued at more than 1 bln. roubles or several contracts valued at more than 1 bln. roubles.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Ministry of Construction is under the impression that this approach needs to be evaluated from the perspective of its impact on business and the effectiveness of construction management.</seg>
<seg id="22">As Elena Zhukova explained, in a case like this, it would be necessary to entrust the client with the functions of the prime contractor, which would lead to an increased number of staff for the client, as well as an increase in budgetary expenditures to maintain them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, the client’s specialists would have to possess the knowledge required to assess the quality of work completed by contracted organizations, as well as its safety.</seg>
<seg id="24">Oftentimes, with this type of set-up, it would be necessary to determine who will bear responsibility for the safety of the project as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">Furthermore, this approach might lead to an outflow of highly qualified personnel from state procurement contracts as a result of a lack of interest in receiving a state order for only part of a project and a low value contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">Deputy Head of the expert-consulting centre, Public Procurement Institute, Aleksandr Yevstashenkov, believes that, right now, the procedure for state contracts has turned into a professional test of a contractor’s attention to detail.</seg>
<seg id="27">He offered the following example: “upon filling-out an application for tender, a participant must provide ‘concrete indicators’ without using the words: ‘or equivalent’, ‘should be’, ‘up to’, ‘more than’, ‘less than’, ‘analogue’, ‘or’, ‘a type’, ‘a similar type’, ‘not lower than’, ‘lower than’, ‘higher than’, ‘may’, ‘may have’, ‘may be’, ‘earlier’, ‘not earlier’, ‘not higher than’, ‘not permitted’, and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="28">In this way, clients often abuse their right to establish the content requirements for the application given to contracting organizations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem with Federal Law 44, according to Yevstashenkov, was the requirement to once again assess the quality of work at the application submission stage through a “paper” proposal by the participant.</seg>
<seg id="30">But in considering a participant’s application, it is really only possible to assess the contractor’s qualifications, and not the quality of work, which hasn’t even commenced yet, the expert reckons.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of work can only be assessed once it has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="32">At the Expert Council, it was also suggested that marginal revenue be transferred from the upper to the lower echelon in order to remove interim contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Chair of the Expert Council, Official Secretary, and Deputy Director of AMS, Andrei Tsarikovsky, believes that this shouldn’t be done, because the general contractor should be in-charge of the project.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, it will turn out like the line from the famous satirical skit by Arkady Raikin, “At the Tailor’s”: “Do you have a complaint about the buttons?”.</seg>

<seg id="1">Israeli Children Return to School After Gaza War</seg>
<seg id="2">Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars rained on their communities during the 50-day Israel-Hamas war, while schools in Gaza remained shuttered as the territory recovered from the fighting.</seg>
<seg id="3">The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to rocket-scarred communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting remained fresh.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the southern city of Ashdod, employees at the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was struck by a rocket, removed shrapnel marks off the walls and slides ahead of the students' arrival.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We are a little scared but we are excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher in its school.</seg>
<seg id="6">A lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt a "little bit weird" to suddenly be going back to school.</seg>
<seg id="8">"There were some difficult times and we didn't leave our houses at all," she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is located close to the Gaza border, to offer his support.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until a cease-fire halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire.</seg>
<seg id="11">Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community close to the Gaza frontier where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are hesitant about coming back.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Education Ministry said about a dozen families still had not returned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their children have been placed in alternate schools for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="14">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a Gaza border town that has been hard hit by Palestinian fire.</seg>
<seg id="15">He urged the children to study hard and said "we will make sure to provide you with knowledge and provide you with security."</seg>
<seg id="16">Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce last Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cease-fire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of an Israel-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and seaports.</seg>
<seg id="18">Israel wants Hamas to disarm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="20">The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and U.N. estimates.</seg>
<seg id="21">Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants, though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting, mostly in the south.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Israeli military, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters.</seg>
<seg id="26">With tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I hope the school will open soon to complete our education, just like the world's children and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy staying in a Gaza City school.</seg>

<seg id="1">Housing prices have posted their strongest winter gain in seven years, according to a widely-watched gauge.</seg>
<seg id="2">The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic home value index of Australian capital city dwelling prices rose by 1.1 per cent in August, RP data said on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The rise brought the total gain over the June, July and August to 4.2 per cent, the biggest rise over the winter months since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annual growth in prices came in at 10.9 per cent, more than double the gain of the 12 months to August 2013, but the gains were not evenly spread across the country.</seg>
<seg id="5">RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two tier market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The RP Data figures show Sydney home prices rose by 16.1 per cent in the past year, while Melbourne's were up by 11.7 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The next strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price rises averaging between five and six per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the other end of the scale was Canberra, hit by government spending cutbacks, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent through the year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Lawless said that now spring has begun there would be a rise in listings of properties for sale over the coming few months, which would be a "real test" for the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates, a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it's likely that dwelling values will rise even further over the next three months," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">How people live in the oldest house in Ufa</seg>
<seg id="2">There are 18 apartments in the former home of gold producers and mine owners, Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov, located at 57/1 October Revolution Street (formerly Bolshaya Kazanskaya).</seg>
<seg id="3">The 18th century home has remained practically unchanged since it was built, except for the disrepair that is.</seg>
<seg id="4">Strangers come here as if on a tour, but the residents suffer more than they are pleased by their privilege: the right to live in the oldest home in Ufa, the walls of which remember the likes of General Aleksandr Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">The exact date of house’s construction is not clear, but historians point to two dates: 1730 and 1737.</seg>
<seg id="6">In either case, it works out that the building is just shy of 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">There’s the old courtyard, the always-open door, the creaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">The apartment doorways are close together, the walls have cracked, and the street is visible through the occasional gaps in the crumbling plaster.</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems as if everything is hanging on by a thread.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the local residents insist: “It doesn’t just seem that way to you – it really is that way”.</seg>
<seg id="11">It’s difficult living in a wooden home from the 18th century, says Tatiana Lukyanova, resident of Apartment No.3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The building is on the state’s list of protected structures, but no money has been allocated for its upkeep for several decades, and we feel as if we are pieces in a museum, which the authorities have simply forgotten about.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation took place 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The walls are still somewhat holding together, but the foundation has totally rotted out.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still have to go outside to use the toilet, and they wash themselves once a week at the public bathhouse.</seg>
<seg id="16">How could anyone be pleased with these kinds of conditions?!</seg>
<seg id="17">The road runs directly outside of the windows, there isn’t even a pedestrian area.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana moves the curtains to the side.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now it’s possible to see what before was only audible: right outside the windows, traffic rushes past.</seg>
<seg id="20">See, the glass is constantly rattling, we can’t open the windows, but we’ve gotten used to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">A person can get used to anything, the good and the bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment is actually a shining example, thanks to my husband; he is good with his hands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, we have two rooms, and there’s just the three of us with my son.</seg>
<seg id="24">But other families live in much worse conditions: on the second floor the ceiling is not much more than a meter and a half high.</seg>
<seg id="25">For the sake of contrast, Tatiana suggests paying a visit to her neighbour from Apartment No. 6, Lyudmila Starostina.</seg>
<seg id="26">The friendly and hospitable woman immediately offers us a cup of coffee and, with a sad smile, recounts:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m² for four people – this is how we live: myself and my husband, our daughter and granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I’ve lived here since I was born, we never had any other living space, Lyudmila gives us a guided tour of the room with her eyes: entresols, two sectional sofas, her granddaughter is sitting with her laptop on one of them.</seg>
<seg id="29">It’s very cramped and hardly differs from the typical domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, “historic”.</seg>
<seg id="30">But the ceilings often leak – the plumbing is in a sore state.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila speaks in both a mundane and wondrous manner about her apartment, like an Italian whose home stands on Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is to say, combing the very old and the recent, the every-day and the legendary, into one and the same thing:</seg>
<seg id="33">The plumbing was installed around 40 years ago during the time of the last renovation.</seg>
<seg id="34">That was also when they made us a kitchen in the cubbyhole and a toilet from the former closet.</seg>
<seg id="35">We actually live right where Demidov and his family lodged, and the servants lived on the second floor.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment isn’t privatized, but what’s the difference?</seg>
<seg id="37">They say that there is no point in privatizing real estate in the centre of Ufa.</seg>
<seg id="38">We would still only get a one-room apartment; we couldn’t seek any more than that.</seg>
<seg id="39">Just four months ago they promised to relocate us, but it didn’t go any further than just promises.</seg>
<seg id="40">I’m not used to complaining and I won’t do it.</seg>
<seg id="41">A whole dynasty has lived in this apartment (room!): my grandmother and grandfather, my mom and dad, my husband and I, and my daughter and granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">So much has happened during this time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, there were ginormous rats that ran all over the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls of the wing – they’re a meter thick!</seg>
<seg id="45">They say that the mixture was made with eggs and that’s why it has been standing for so long.</seg>
<seg id="46">The house was built well, thanks to the Demidovs!</seg>
<seg id="47">It’s probably the only reason why no one yet has been killed by a collapsed ceiling or post.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only the building is still slowly dying right in front of our eyes: the house’s wooden planks and beams are rotting, the floors have caved in several times, we poured cement, but all to no avail – the mixture just seeps into the ground, like pouring it into a manhole.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say that that’s exactly it – underneath our room is a secret passageway and exit to the Belaya River, which was specially built by some old believers who lived here at one time, so that they could take refuge in case of danger.</seg>
<seg id="50">They were being persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Starostina recalls how some historian came and pleaded with them to let him in so that he could start excavations in the apartment.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then he tried to persuade them to give him their apartment in exchange for his one-room apartment on October Avenue.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila declined the historian’s offer:</seg>
<seg id="54">What would the four of us have done in a one-room apartment?</seg>
<seg id="55">And here there’s at least a glimmer of hope that they’ll give us more spacious accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="56">You have to agree that we would have come out the losers if we had agreed to that exchange.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the Starostin family hasn’t won anything either.</seg>
<seg id="58">Lyudmila’s biggest dream is to be relocated, and that her daughter with her 16 year-old granddaughter would be given a room of their own.</seg>
<seg id="59">In other words, that the two families are allocated a two-room apartment in place of the less than majestic ruin in which the two generations currently reside.</seg>
<seg id="60">A petite, nice-looking young lady, Olesia Karsakova from Apartments No. 11 and No. 12, shows us the second story of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">There, in two cramped little rooms called apartments, with a total area of 23 m², lives her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">Altogether, there are seven of us, two being children.</seg>
<seg id="63">You can see for yourself what conditions are like.</seg>
<seg id="64">The plaster is falling off in chunks and the window frames are just as bad, the walls in the kitchen and other rooms have holes that reach all the way through to the outside.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water from the tap only runs cold all year round.</seg>
<seg id="66">Having walked through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, it is evident that the Lavrentev couple from Apartment No. 4 are the luckiest of the lot.</seg>
<seg id="67">They reside in the most spacious rooms on the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You’re right, there’s lots of space!</seg>
<seg id="69">Three people are registered at this 75 square meter premises.</seg>
<seg id="70">We reside in the very same rooms where, as legend has it, Suvorov stayed during his time spent in Ufa, says the head of the family, Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentev.</seg>
<seg id="71">The ceilings are high and spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">The only downside: everything around us is falling apart at the seams, collapsing, crumbling.</seg>
<seg id="73">The neighbours have probably already told you about this!</seg>
<seg id="74">The biggest bother for us is the floors: the wooden boards are rotten, the soil is literally coming up under one’s feet.</seg>
<seg id="75">I’ve installed props and wedges; the hall isn’t so bad, but when we’re walking in other rooms it’s like we’re riding on the swing, because it’s so shaky.</seg>
<seg id="76">Aleksandr Dmitrievich can talk about the home of the merchant, Evdokim Demidov, better than any tour guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">He treats the gold producer as if he were a relative, and talks about him admiringly.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, this character had a lot going for him: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzyansk factories built homes, cast canons and bells, and kept the Ural mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">The heirs to the merchant’s real estate take pride in their forefather, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.</seg>
<seg id="80">I moved here when I was still a child, in the 1940s, said Aleksandr Dmitrievich.</seg>
<seg id="81">Back then there were wooden structures all around, for the carriage, stables, and watch houses, but later on they were knocked down.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, they even wanted to demolish our house, but something got in the way….</seg>
<seg id="83">History repeated itself in 2014: once again a new home beckoned.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as if by command, collected all the documents, ran around to all of the necessary authorities, and then, suddenly, we found out that the move was being postponed until 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">There’s something we no longer believe in all this….</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentev went to the Ministry of Culture for the Republic of Bashkortostan in order to find out about the fate of the house.</seg>
<seg id="87">The bureaucrats wouldn’t see the residents.</seg>
<seg id="88">They sent me from one desk to another, and then, as if in mockery, issued me a piece of paper without a signature or a stamp that said: "The Ministry of Culture is not adverse to the resettlement of the residents".</seg>
<seg id="89">I even have the sense that our house hasn’t been in the city plan for quite some time now, after all, at first it was No. 57, and then it became 57 A, and now it’s 57/1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if they had already torn it down in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">Russian Planet contacted the Head of the Informational and Analytical Works Section of the Land Resource Department for Ufa, Vladimir Barabash.</seg>
<seg id="92">The house at 57/1 October Revolution Street is included in the programme for the resettlement of dilapidated housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I can’t answer for the actions of bureaucrats in the 1970s, I only know that back then there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, regardless of their historical importance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Thankfully, this didn’t happen, and there is a decree from the current authorities to restore all of the historic buildings on October Revolution Street that have architectural merit, which is being successfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="95">It is planned to resettle the residents in new apartments in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Barabash, Italian specialists, who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice, will restore the Demidov House.</seg>
<seg id="97">Right now, in Italy, an architectural biennial is underway, and the "Old Ufa" project is being represented there along with others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that, by 2016, all of the former Staraya Kazanskaya Street will be fully resorted, the bureaucrat says.</seg>
<seg id="99">The homes will be given an appropriate appearance that corresponds with what they would have looked like before, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Demidov House will most probably become a museum that will be open to the public.</seg>
<seg id="101">Furthermore, a decision has been made at the government level to make the street a pedestrian zone on weekends.</seg>
<seg id="102">Unfortunately, it wouldn’t work during the week, as the city’s streets are too congested.</seg>
<seg id="103">Vladimir Barabash promises that the resettlement of those people living in the future museum will happen in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it’s unlikely that they will end up being satisfied: their new apartments will be the same size as their current ones.</seg>
<seg id="105">However, they’ll be from a different epoch.</seg>

<seg id="2">A dry thunderstorm caused the start of a forest fire within the territory of the Okhotnichy local forest area in the Pozharsky district of Primorsky Krai.</seg>
<seg id="3">The organization of a task force and resources is underway at the site of the conflagration.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to information from authorities at the regional special state-funded organization, Primorsky Airbase, conditions on the ground created by the fire require the use of airpower.</seg>
<seg id="5">Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of the airbase:</seg>
<seg id="6">An observer pilot on-board an An-2 patrol aircraft detected a fire, which began in a hard-to-reach area, over an area of 3 hectares.</seg>
<seg id="7">Woody debris is burning on the remnants of the old scorched forest.</seg>
<seg id="8">The overwhelming amount of debris in the area and a slope gradient of more than 45 degrees, as well as the absence of a suitable area for firefighter-troopers to land, are creating significant obstacles to putting out the fire.</seg>
<seg id="9">An Mi-8 helicopter is needed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The delivery of forces has been seriously hampered by the fact that the airbase only has an Mi-2 helicopter and an An-2 plane at its disposal.</seg>
<seg id="11">Following the detection of the fire, 4 firefighter-troopers were strategically dropped at the fire suppression site.</seg>
<seg id="12">The specialists’ main task is to put out the fire and prepare the area for the delivery of additional forces and firefighting resources.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around lunchtime, a helicopter additionally delivered 3 firefighter-troopers to the area around the village of Okhotnichy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.</seg>
<seg id="2">Never said "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the tunes are upbeat.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry has had to work through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">There was "a lot" of therapy after his mother died and Henry is reflective about his relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very unknowable.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: 'Stop the noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Leave your sister alone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Move!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown-up when I was a kid - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass, the beauty of the stroke in cricket.</seg>
<seg id="15">I never had a conversation with him like that.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was this unsmiling bloke in the corner, reading the paper for a lot of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in his father's day, he got a snapshot of what life must have been like for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's a bit brighter now but they're dark, smoky, Stygian labyrinthine depths with bursts of flame and smoke and lots of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My dad used to get in the bath and just lie there and you'd hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would wash the foundry off him.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I walked round it, I realised that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table, and my estimation of him went up.</seg>
<seg id="21">None the less, Henry emerged from a childhood stripped of parental affection.</seg>
<seg id="22">My dad never did hugging, never said, 'I love you'.</seg>
<seg id="23">It wasn't until my mum was poorly near the end of her life that we started saying 'I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">Having a daughter of his own, Billie, with Dawn French, enabled him to share the love he missed as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">Could you stop with the "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just stop hugging me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why wouldn't I be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mum</seg>
<seg id="31">He's still very good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn's a good person.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why wouldn't I be friends with Dawn?</seg>
<seg id="34">She's a great mum.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry's own mother was diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="36">It was one of the things that killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So when I became very, very overweight and started getting diabetic symptoms, my doctor said, 'You've got to be radical.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I went on a big fitness thing, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it's tedious.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nobody likes eating carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">Henry's change in career trajectory is, perhaps, reflected in his distinguished, close-cropped beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he won critical acclaim for his Othello, he has become engrossed in the theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">Comedy of Errors followed, as did Fences by August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have upholstered his busy working life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and wrote to New Faces about him.</seg>
<seg id="48">His TV career was launched in the mid-Seventies: "For quite a long time I was the only black impressionist/comedian on telly."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learnt on the job.</seg>
<seg id="50">Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye, I had to learn how to be an efficient joke-delivering mechanism between 1975 and 1985, whilst being a star, being on television and it was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny on New Faces in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">Because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment programme in which people "blacked up," Henry found himself performing his comedy in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family were very uncomfortable about it.</seg>
<seg id="54">I sort of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Although it was a weird, reprehensible position to be in, I was working in huge venues and learning how to work a crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But what was an "award-winning light entertainment staple of British television for years and years" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">Introducing characters who both lampooned and celebrated black British culture, Henry worked on the alternative comedy circuit in the Eighties.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first series of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the Nineties he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.</seg>
<seg id="59">Advertisements, documentaries, TV series and parts in films consumed his next decade but after his 2008 BBC series, LennyHenry.tv, he thought: "What are you going to do next, Len, because it all feels a bit like you're marking time or you're slightly going sideways."</seg>
<seg id="60">What came next was a Radio 4 documentary series called What's So Great About...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was on Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">I wasn't really taught it at school properly and thought it was very much the reserve of middle-class white people with tights and a cabbage down the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I was very frightened of it.</seg>
<seg id="65">Everybody we interviewed on that show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, 'You should try it.</seg>
<seg id="66">Don't slag it off if you don't know what you're talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Get some of the words in your mouth and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry delivered 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was hooked.</seg>
<seg id="69">It gave me the feeling that I could do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">It's almost like I had my head put on straight for me.</seg>
<seg id="71">'This is what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your lines, do some research.</seg>
<seg id="72">So the rehearsal process was brutal and I was reading that play for months and months before we did it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They seemed to expect a car crash and it didn't quite happen.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon he was starring in Comedy of Errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre and I just couldn't quite believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment where I thought, 'Oh, you've changed.""</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical fault and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to keep the audience entertained.</seg>
<seg id="79">"A little voice inside me said, 'You're going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer.""</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the stage manager announced the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked off the stage and something in me went, "Oh, thank God".</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can let somebody else sort it out.</seg>
<seg id="84">'You're in a play, stay in character.""</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry appearing in Fences at the Duchess Theatre</seg>
<seg id="86">Learning his lines for Fences was challenging.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic's quite good, it stiffens the sinews.</seg>
<seg id="88">That was well received too, so it's like a big sign from the gods, saying, 'This is what you should be doing.""</seg>
<seg id="89">He says this, of course, in a BOOMING voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I'm sticking with it.</seg>
<seg id="91">I'm really loving it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love being in a rehearsal room.</seg>
<seg id="93">Henry still has a comedian's brain, though - throughout, our conversation is broken with flashes of his humour as he slips in and out of impressions.</seg>
<seg id="94">I'm just choosing not to do stand-up because that thing of getting instant gratification from a room full of strangers I guess is kind of dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you're constantly seeking that it can lead to a brick wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I do Live at the Apollo sometimes when I want to, but generally it doesn't float my boat like it used to.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask whether he'll ever do another stand-up tour.</seg>
<seg id="98">The joy of sitting in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning, middle and end of a journey - I don't think I'll ever want to give that up.</seg>
<seg id="99">So this is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like being an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's good fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">You're always telling a story and that's a great place to be.</seg>
<seg id="104">I love stories.</seg>
<seg id="105">People love stories.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kenya has started biometrically registering all civil servants in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from the government's payroll.</seg>
<seg id="3">Employees who failed to register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service.</seg>
<seg id="5">President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to curb corruption in the public service after taking office in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="6">An audit earlier this year found that at least $1m (£700,000) a month was lost in payments to "ghost workers" and other financial malpractice.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.</seg>
<seg id="8">All public servants are required to present themselves over the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure their data is captured through the biometric registration exercise, a government statement said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anyone who failed to do so without a valid excuse would be eliminated from the payroll, it said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This exercise will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual numbers of public servants and will also be used to cleanse the payroll at both levels of government- hence bring a stop to the issue of 'ghost workers'," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Devolution and Planning.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the formidable chief it needs</seg>
<seg id="2">She comes trailing clouds of glory from the world of banking, media management and the inner conclaves of the Tory party.</seg>
<seg id="3">Indeed, she has had frontline experience of her own.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her career began at global management consultants Bain and Co, then progressed via Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.</seg>
<seg id="5">She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when the top job at its parent company Pearson's went to a junior male colleague.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her pay-off is said to be close to £1 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her political rating is sturdy, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former head of BP, when he was looking to bring private expertise into Whitehall: she became a cabinet office adviser.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her husband is a former Tory councillor.</seg>
<seg id="10">Back in May, I described the chairman's job as a poisoned chalice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is an inner paradox to its structure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The trust faces in two directions: inwards as the upper tier of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also outwards as the voice of public concern and disquiet when things go awry.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is an almost untenable duopoly calling for complete root-and-branch reform.</seg>
<seg id="14">But what incoming chairman would risk coming in, crashing around and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty in case they put themselves out of a job in the process.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's a difficult call.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that weren't tough enough, plenty of people are keen to see the BBC cut down in size - its power, its finances and its status overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="17">As competitors circle ever closer and new technology challenges cosy old certainties, the imminent negotiation of the licence fee is fraught with especial danger for the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public buys into what is surely the greatest media enterprise in the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its output reaches 96 per cent of households, and costs each one of them just 40p a day.</seg>
<seg id="20">What's more, apparently the Beeb's popularity is rising: 53 per cent support today as against 31 per cent 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">Patterns of watching and using the BBC have changed: I receive news headlines on my mobile phone these days, and catch up on missed programmes with iPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it remains a much-loved and formidable institution.</seg>
<seg id="23">It needs a formidable chairman - I hope it has found one.</seg>

<seg id="2">A tweet from Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry's verified account on Sunday night included a disparaging image of the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of his criminal indictment on charges of abuse of power.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account that disavowed the post.</seg>
<seg id="4">A tweet just went out from my account that was unauthorized.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I do not condone the tweet and I have taken it down," the later post said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perry aides did not immediately return messages seeking comment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although the tweets were sent from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who does the actual posting for the feed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The earlier tweet posted an unflattering mock image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">Perry vetoed funds to her office when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury in Austin this month indicting Perry - who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The caption on the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk at 3x the legal blood alcohol limit ... but when I do, I indict Gov. Perry for calling me out about it."</seg>
<seg id="11">I am the most drunk Democrat in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Lehmberg's office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Perry.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was handled by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio-based special prosecutor who was assigned by a Republican judge.</seg>
<seg id="14">Perry has pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.</seg>
<seg id="15">His high-powered legal team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the law being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutionally vague.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perry cut off $7.5 million in state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and prosecutes public corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.</seg>
<seg id="17">That veto drew a formal complaint from a left-leaning watchdog group.</seg>
<seg id="18">Perry's verified account is updated frequently - and sometimes famously.</seg>
<seg id="19">After finishing in fifth place in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry addressed speculation that he might call it quits with a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, and the words, "Here we come South Carolina!"</seg>

<seg id="2">One of London's most prominent property developers has warned that the housing market in southeast England has "reverted" to normal levels of activity.</seg>
<seg id="3">Homes in the capital have been the subject of red-hot demand and surging prices, with widespread fears of a credit bubble prompting the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage borrowing in June.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of upmarket housebuilder Berkeley, on Monday said: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has reverted to normal transaction levels from the high point in 2013," adding that this offered a "stable operating environment."</seg>
<seg id="5">London's property market fared well during the downturn as foreign buyers piled into the capital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Prices in the city have leapt 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to Land Registry data, far outstripping the 6.7 per cent average for England and Wales as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="7">Average selling prices on Berkeley's private, affordable and student schemes have risen by about a fifth in the past year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, a strengthening pound has in recent months made London property less attractive to foreign buyers - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion tax" ahead of the general election next May.</seg>
<seg id="9">London estate agent Foxtons last week warned that April's Mortgage Market Review, which introduced tougher lending rules, would also spark lower rates of market growth in both property sales transactions and prices during the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of mortgage approvals in July, further suggesting the housing market is cooling.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hamptons International, another estate agent, has cut its 2015 forecast for London property price growth to 3 per cent on the basis that house price sentiment is already starting to weaken.</seg>
<seg id="12">Transaction volumes have meanwhile dropped by a quarter year on year in London's most expensive postcodes, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to agent WA Ellis.</seg>
<seg id="13">Still, appetite for homes in the capital has been a boon to Berkeley, pushing up cash due on forward sales to more than £2.2bn.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Pidgley added: "Demand for the right product with good design in the best locations has remained resilient and, reflecting this, forward sales have been maintained."</seg>
<seg id="15">In June the company reported it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="16">Annual pre-tax profits rose 40 per cent year on year to £380m, on revenues up 18 per cent to £1.6bn.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking on Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said Berkeley's earnings for the year were anticipated to be in line with current market expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Analyst consensus is for full-year pre-tax profit of £450m.</seg>
<seg id="19">Berkeley shares were flat at £23.96 in afternoon London trading.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence have been leaked online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of 100 other starlets.</seg>
<seg id="4">A representative for the star of "The Hunger Games" confirmed the photos of Lawrence were real and blasted the hacker for "a flagrant violation of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="5">The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.</seg>
<seg id="6">The photos, which originally were posted on the image-sharing site 4chan, were purportedly obtained through a weakness in Apple's iCloud online storage system, and a purported "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not clear how many of the images are authentic, though "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" star Winstead took to Twitter to denounce the hack as well.</seg>
<seg id="8">"To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home, hope you feel great about yourselves," Winstead tweeted.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter 'J'</seg>
<seg id="2">They dissolved, that was the best way of putting it, they gradually came apart like a cardboard box that had been left out in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Just occasionally a woman told him he was too serious, hard-going, intense, detached, and maybe a bit prickly.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then shook his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">He recognised prickly.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was spiny, like a hedgehog, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The latest casualty of this spininess was an embryo-affair that had given greater promise than usual of relieving the lonely tedium of his life, and perhaps even bringing him some content.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ailinn Solomons was a wild-haired, quiveringly delicate beauty with a fluttering heart from a northern island village more remote and rugged even than Port Reuben.</seg>
<seg id="9">She had come south with an older companion whom Kevern took to be her aunt, the latter having been left a property in a wet but paradisal valley called, felicitously, Paradise Valley.</seg>
<seg id="10">No one had lived in the house for several years.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pipes leaked, there were spiders still in the baths, slugs had signed their signatures on all the windows, believing the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown with weeds that resembled giant cabbages.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like a children's story cottage, threatening and enchanting at the same time, the garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is longlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist is announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">Kevern had been sitting holding hands with Ailinn on broken deckchairs in the long grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, the pair of them absent-mindedly plugged into the utility console that supplied the country with soothing music and calming news, when the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer his father had liked listening to with the cottage blinds down.</seg>
<seg id="16">Your feet's too big.</seg>
<seg id="17">On account of their innate aggressiveness, songs of that sort were no longer played on the console.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not banned - nothing was banned exactly - simply not played.</seg>
<seg id="19">Encouraged to fall into desuetude, like the word desuetude.</seg>
<seg id="20">Popular taste did what edict and proscription could never have done, and just as, when it came to books, the people chose rags-to-riches memoirs, cookbooks and romances, so, when it came to music, they chose ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">Carried away by the day, Kevern began to play at an imaginary piano and in a rudely comic voice serenade Ailinn's big feet.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ailinn didn't understand.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">This his father had always done to stifle the letter j before it left his lips.</seg>
<seg id="25">It had begun as a game between them when he was small.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father had played it with his own father, he'd told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Begin a word with a j without remembering to put two fingers across your mouth and it cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It had not been much fun then and it was not much fun now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew it was expected of him, that was all.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had to explain what jazz was.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ailinn had never heard any.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz, too, without exactly being proscribed, wasn't played.</seg>
<seg id="33">Improvisation had fallen out of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="34">There was room for only one "if" in life.</seg>
<seg id="35">People wanted to be sure, when a tune began, exactly where it was going to end.</seg>
<seg id="36">Wit, the same.</seg>
<seg id="37">Its unpredictability unsettled people's nerves.</seg>
<seg id="38">And jazz was wit expressed musically.</seg>
<seg id="39">Though he reached the age of 10 without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew of jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, she was unlikely to have remembered a time when popular singers weren't black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, no laws or duress.</seg>
<seg id="43">A compliant society meant that every section of it consented with gratitude - the gratitude of the providentially spared - to the principle of group aptitude.</seg>
<seg id="44">People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and physique to entertainment and athletics, and so they sang and sprinted.</seg>
<seg id="45">People originally from the Indian subcontinent, electronically gifted as though by nature, undertook to ensure no family was without a functioning utility phone.</seg>
<seg id="46">What was left of the Polish community plumbed; what was left of the Greek smashed plates.</seg>
<seg id="47">Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents hadn't quickly left the country while WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED was happening - fearing they'd be accused of having stoked the flames, fearing, indeed, that the flames would consume them next - opened labneh and shisha-pipe restaurants, kept their heads down, and grew depressed with idleness.</seg>
<seg id="48">To each according to his gifts.</seg>
<seg id="49">Having heard only ballads, Ailinn was hard pressed to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever have been set to music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music was the expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They're not really insulting," Kevern said.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except maybe to people whose feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never insulted anybody, but he delighted in this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He was saying too much, but the garden's neglect gave the illusion of safety.</seg>
<seg id="55">No word could get beyond the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn still didn't comprehend.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why would your father have loved something like that?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say it was a joke, but was reluctant, in her company, to put two fingers to his lips again.</seg>
<seg id="59">She already thought he was strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It struck him as funny," he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">She shook her head in disbelief, blotting out Kevern's vision.</seg>
<seg id="62">Nothing to see in the whole wide world but her haystack of crow-black hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">Nothing else he wanted to see.</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you say so," she said, unconvinced.</seg>
<seg id="65">But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed in genuine distress.</seg>
<seg id="67">Are my feet too big?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked again.</seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet specifically, no.</seg>
<seg id="70">Your ankles, maybe, a bit...</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">Hate you?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course I don't hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">That's just the silly song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon for that.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Your thick ankles are the very reason I'm attracted to you," he tried instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I'm perverse that way.</seg>
<seg id="78">It came out wrong.</seg>
<seg id="79">He had meant it to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">Meaning to be funny often landed him in a mess because, like his father, he lacked the reassuring charm necessary to temper the cruelty that lurked in jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father intended to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he, Kevern, did.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite his kind eyes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn Solomons flushed and rose from her deckchair, knocking over the console and spilling the wine they'd been drinking.</seg>
<seg id="85">Elderflower wine, so drink wasn't his excuse.</seg>
<seg id="86">In her agitation she seemed to tremble, like the fronds of a palm tree in a storm.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And your thick head's the very reason I'm perversely attracted to you," she said...</seg>
<seg id="88">Except that I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="89">He felt sorry for her, both on account of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes in the moment of her standing up to him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Did she think he'd strike her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She hadn't spoken to him about life on the chill northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he didn't doubt it was in all essentials similar to here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same vast and icy ocean crashed in on them both.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same befuddled men, even more thin-skinned and peevish in the aftermath of WHAT HAPPENED than their smuggler and wrecker ancestors had been, roamed angrily from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand to any woman who dared to refuse or twit them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Thick head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They'd show her a thick fist, if she wasn't careful!</seg>
<seg id="96">Snog her first - the snog having become the most common expression of erotic irritation between men and women; an antidote to the bland ballads of love the console pumped out - snog her first and cuff her later.</seg>
<seg id="97">An unnecessary refinement in Kevern's view, since a snog was itself an act of thuggery.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn Solomons made a sign with her body for him to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He heaved himself out of the deckchair like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She felt leaden herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This wasn't the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She watched him go - as at an upstairs window her companion watched him go - a man made heavy by what he'd brought on himself.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam leaving the garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a pang for him and for men in general, no matter that some had raised their hands to her.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man turned from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, all the fight in him leaked away - why was that a sight she felt she knew so well, when she couldn't recall a single instance, before today, of having seen it?</seg>
<seg id="107">Alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">A score or so years before the events related above, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher employed by Ofnow, the non-statutory monitor of the Public Mood, prepared a short paper on the continuance of low- and medium-level violence in those very areas of the country where its reduction, if not its cessation, was most to have been expected, given the money and energy expended on uprooting it.</seg>
<seg id="109">"Much has been done, and much continues to be done," she wrote, "to soothe the native aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in those twisted knarls and narrow crevices of the country where, though the spires of churches soar above the hedgerows, the sweeter breath of human kindness has, historically, been rarely felt.</seg>
<seg id="110">But some qualities are proving to be ineradicable.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions it goes on engendering.</seg>
<seg id="112">The populace weeps to sentimental ballads, gorges on stories of adversity overcome, and professes to believe ardently in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the old brutishness retain a pertinacious hold equally on rural communities as on our urban conurbations, evidence suggests the emergence of a new and vicious quarrelsomeness in the home, in the workplace, on our roads and even on our playing fields.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have an unfortunate tendency to overwrite," her supervisor said when he had read the whole report.</seg>
<seg id="114">May I suggest you read fewer novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also enquire: are you an atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I believe I am not obliged to say," Esme Nussbaum replied.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you a lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Again Esme protested her right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">A feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Silence once more.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said at last, "because I have an objection to atheism, lesbianism or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">This is a prejudice-free workplace.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of a prejudice-free society.</seg>
<seg id="125">But certain kinds of hypersensitivity, while entirely acceptable and laudable in themselves, may sometimes distort findings such as you have presented to me.</seg>
<seg id="126">You are obviously yourself prejudiced against the church; and those things you call "vicious" and "brutish," others could as soon interpret as expressions of natural vigour and vitality.</seg>
<seg id="127">To still be harping on about WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as though it happened, if it happened, yesterday, is to sap the country of its essential life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme Nussbaum looked around her while Rabinowitz spoke.</seg>
<seg id="129">Behind his head a flamingo pink LED scroll repeated the advice Ofnow had been dispensing to the country for the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">Smile at your neighbour, cherish your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your telephone, converse, explain, listen, agree, apologise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Talk is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand the points you are making," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice, once she was certain her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I am saying no more than that we are not healed as effectively as we delude ourselves we are.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that, if we are not forewarned, we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time it will not be on others that we vent our anger and mistrust.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz made a pyramid of his fingers.</seg>
<seg id="136">This was to suggest infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "in describing as "mistakes" actions which our grandparents might or might not have taken.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far, as well, in speaking of them venting their "anger" and "mistrust" on "others."</seg>
<seg id="139">It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past, as in protecting the present, we do not speak of "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "we" and there were no "others."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of disorder, that is all we know of it.</seg>
<seg id="142">"In which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to interject, "no section of society can claim to have acquitted itself well.</seg>
<seg id="143">I make no accusations.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was done ill, or done well, what was done was done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then was then.</seg>
<seg id="146">No more needs to be said - on this we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And just as there is no blame to be apportioned, so there are no amends to be made, were amends appropriate and were there any way of making them.</seg>
<seg id="148">But what is the past for if not to learn from it -</seg>
<seg id="149">The past exists in order that we forget it.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I may add one word to that -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I will consider your report," he said, dismissing her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, turning up for work as usual, she was knocked down by a motorcyclist who had mounted the pavement in what passers-by described as a "vicious rage."</seg>
<seg id="154">Coincidences happen.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lesotho military officials denied staging a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were acting against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the country's military had surrounded his official home and seized government buildings in the capital of Maseru.</seg>
<seg id="4">The premier took his family to neighboring South Africa after saying he received an assassination threat.</seg>
<seg id="5">Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was not, in fact, a coup, but that the military was responding to a threat from "political fanatics" whom police were attempting to arm.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened this morning was that the command of the Lesotho Defense Force was acting after receiving several intelligence reports that amongst the police service, there are some elements who are actually planning to arm some of the political, party political youth fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc," he told Voice of America.</seg>
<seg id="7">South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military's actions had the appearance at an overthrow.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Although no one has claimed to have taken over government through the use of force, by all accounts the activities of the Lesotho defense force thus far bear the hallmarks of a coup d'etat," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lesotho military officials said soldiers returned to their barracks Sunday and there was calm in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="10">Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing in control of the government in Thabane's absence.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thabane said he believes he is being targeted due to his attempt to fight corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="12">Tensions have been high in Lesotho since June when Thabane suspended parliament sessions due to feuding in his unity government.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said his actions have not undermined the government, despite allegations otherwise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eurozone manufacturing at 13-month low</seg>
<seg id="2">Manufacturing growth in the eurozone slowed to a 13-month low in August, according to a closely-watched survey.</seg>
<seg id="3">The final Markit's Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">A figure above 50 indicates expansion.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders dwindled and factories suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The figures come ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets will be looking for a clear plan from the bank to deal with a stalled eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation standing at just 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB boss Mario Draghi could offer further indications later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone, similar to those taken by the UK and US during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers is becoming more visible," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.</seg>
<seg id="10">The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's biggest trade partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.</seg>
<seg id="12">France remains a real concern, as does Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Signs that growth impetus waned in the key industrial engine of Germany, and in Spain and the Netherlands too, is also less than reassuring," Mr Dobson said.</seg>
<seg id="14">The slowdown in industry is likely to add further fuel to the fire for analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="15">One positive note was from the Republic of Ireland, which saw its PMI grow to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said for the August eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' survey is that it indicates that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Eurozone manufacturers are clearly finding life very difficult at the moment as current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly related to Russia/Ukraine - add uncertainty to still challenging conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This heightened uncertainty has clearly hit business - especially, and consumer confidence, and it is likely causing some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, particularly big-ticket orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said it was looking "ever more likely" that the ECB would ultimately have to undertake some form of QE, "although we suspect that it will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="2">Everything was calm in Mariupol up until last week – no one was eager to set up a Mariupol People's Republic – people in the city on the Azov Sea were busy working and living.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now residents wait in terror for the “rebels” to arrive.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to political analysts, the separatists are descending on Mariupol in order to access the Azov Sea – the city of Novoazovsk, which was also not previously a part of the self-proclaimed republics, was recently captured.</seg>
<seg id="5">Residents of Mariupol decided that although the Ukrainian army would defend them its strength was no match against the well-equipped representatives of the DPR and LPR, and so they decided to help out their soldiers.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Beslan survivors' decade of hell: Ten years since the horrific school siege, how the children caught up in it are still suffering</seg>
<seg id="2">Ten years ago over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia</seg>
<seg id="3">More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world</seg>
<seg id="4">We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly a decade after the appalling Beslan school siege in which 334 perished, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">When fanatic Islamic terrorists kidnapped and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the start of a new term, it seemed like the nadir of all evil.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tragedy united east and west in revulsion, which amazingly then turned to action and hope for the future in the direst misery.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ten years on, we went back to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity.</seg>
<seg id="9">We discovered amazing young people, who have defied adversity, though the memory of this terrorist hell will live with them forever.</seg>
<seg id="10">Their greatest hope?</seg>
<seg id="11">That the war now scarring Ukraine - in which children like them are dying - will now stop.</seg>
<seg id="12">The girl pictured trying to climb back inside the blitzed school gym</seg>
<seg id="13">She was famously snapped by top Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov wearing only her underwear as tried to climb back inside the blitzed school gym after a mine exploded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bewildered, Aida was desperately searching for her mother, Larissa, now 40.</seg>
<seg id="15">Both were feared dead, but in fact they survived.</seg>
<seg id="16">'A woman told me to run for my life but I couldn't,' said Aida at the time.</seg>
<seg id="17">My legs were covered in blood.</seg>
<seg id="18">I got up and climbed back in to look for my mum.</seg>
<seg id="19">A soldier plucked her to safety.</seg>
<seg id="20">After a series of surgeries, she thought she had totally recovered but said yesterday: 'Three months ago, the pain came back.</seg>
<seg id="21">I fear I may need more surgery.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some shrapnel pieces are still in my knee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Her aim now is to become a dentist, to help people as she has been aided by medics.</seg>
<seg id="24">'This tragedy changed my life but it surely did not break it,' she said defiantly.</seg>
<seg id="25">'It happened to me and you can't change this fact.</seg>
<seg id="26">Once a year I always go to the gym to recall those who remained there.</seg>
<seg id="27">My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.</seg>
<seg id="28">The pain is too much.</seg>
<seg id="29">My best friend and my classmate-to-be Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.</seg>
<seg id="30">We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together.</seg>
<seg id="31">'I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.</seg>
<seg id="32">I will think about a family later.</seg>
<seg id="33">She says the siege remains with her though memories fade a little each year.</seg>
<seg id="34">I am pleased that many people in the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in Britain and everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="35">When I see online the photograph of me climbing into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, understand about our disaster, and stop this from happening any more.</seg>
<seg id="36">The boy who fled through a hail of bullets believing his mother to be dead</seg>
<seg id="37">He was on his first day at school (Russians start school aged 7) and survived the three day siege hugging his mum Tamara.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then seven he said: 'Mummy told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.'</seg>
<seg id="39">After one explosion he thought she was dying.</seg>
<seg id="40">She told him: 'Run'.</seg>
<seg id="41">Fearing she was dead, he fled and on his way he saw a crying toddler, grabbed the child by the hand, and fled through a hail of bullets.</seg>
<seg id="42">His dad Vladimir, who scooped up his son outside, said: 'Damir told me his mother had died.</seg>
<seg id="43">He said: 'I couldn't save her'.'</seg>
<seg id="44">In fact, Tamara had stumbled free and was in hospital with leg wounds, in turn believing her son had perished.</seg>
<seg id="45">After their reunion she said: 'I wept with joy.</seg>
<seg id="46">I couldn't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="47">He ran in and hugged me.</seg>
<seg id="48">Damir was later flown to London (by the now defunct News of the World newspaper) to be crowned a Barnardo's Children's Champion by then premier Tony Blair and wife wife Cherie.</seg>
<seg id="49">'This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop recalling it,' he said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still I can say that in my mind it is fading.</seg>
<seg id="51">I remember right afterwards, I threw away all my toy guns.</seg>
<seg id="52">But now I can play computer games with shooting and it is not a problem for me.</seg>
<seg id="53">'I'm not scared to go back in the gym but I don't think about myself.</seg>
<seg id="54">I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard who never got out.</seg>
<seg id="55">We never say they were killed or dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say they stayed in the gym.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember my trip to London so well, specially the toy shop where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted, and riding in an open top car.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he fears for places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of misery he and his friends suffered.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop recalling it</seg>
<seg id="60">'I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,' said Damir, who was last week doing voluntary work at a nunnery.</seg>
<seg id="61">I want to help so much.</seg>
<seg id="62">I want to serve in the police one day and hope they enrol me to the training academy next year.</seg>
<seg id="63">His mother Tamara, 48, said: '37 kids were killed in our neighbourhood, can you imagine?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember terrible silence right after the siege, there were just no children to shout and run around, and that silence lasted for many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">She vividly recalls her trip with Damir to London.</seg>
<seg id="66">People in London were crying when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I realised then how folk on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, can show their support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was grateful to 'Cherie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I wish I could call Cherie and just say it myself that 10 years have gone but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember when Damir wanted to eat borsch soup, they called all the local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he was playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir was shooting at them from his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And we were just one month away from our horror then.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was amazed that the British people were so ready to share our pain and to support us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: 'I keep thinking this world did not get better within these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">Now in Ukraine the war goes on, people are dying every day, and I believe many children were killed and will be killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">They are just the same children, like ours.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bored or busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I just know what those people feel, the horror of it.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and it is so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became a very gentle and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not seeking revenge for example, he is not preoccupied with this past horror.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to recall it but he is very close with six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was smaller he suffered from it - I remember he used to lie down on the sofa with his face turned away from us, for hours at a time.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not sleeping, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw away all his guns and other army-type toys.Damir is 17 now, taller than me, nice looking, clever and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that for some hours I was so sure he was dead and I'd never see him again.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I managed to recover after the explosion and got on my feet I looked around, I saw the hell around me, when body parts were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that there was no way my little boy could have survived in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">'I remember I was shouting to him 'Damir, run, run away' but again I was so sure he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he did hear, and he did run away.</seg>
<seg id="92">So life goes on for us unlike for so many.</seg>
<seg id="93">Georgy Ilyin, 17</seg>
<seg id="94">The boy whose shocking image after the siege came to define the horror of Beslan</seg>
<seg id="95">Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mum Fatima after the siege in 2004, while on the right is Georgy today</seg>
<seg id="96">His bloodstained face was etched with fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates.</seg>
<seg id="97">His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity at Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, a senior GP, had dropped him for his first day at school before rushing to take her elder son Vladimir to university.</seg>
<seg id="99">'I left two minutes before the terrorists rushed into the yard, so my little boy was left there alone for three days of horror,' she recalled.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not completely alone, we had a family of relatives there but all of them were killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my Georgy managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is no single day when we do not recall this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not feel it was long ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes from those days come to my mind all the time.</seg>
<seg id="105">Nobody will ever forget, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Haunting: The image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and has been immortalised in a statue (right)</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember Georgy so much wanted to go to school on that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I only got to know he was alive when I saw him TV.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there is even a statue to crying Georgy in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">Georgy does not like to look at this picture and it is hidden it in the bookcase in our home.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand, but I also think that thanks to this picture people from all over the world feel our pain.</seg>

<seg id="114">People keep investigating such tragedies and never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is moving to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">'I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no-one wants a war, so how does it happen?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years to pass in order to forget it a little.</seg>
<seg id="121">It affected my health and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege but then it got better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I got back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">This is why I keep going to the gym as each 1 September approaches.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is hard for me to go inside the gym but I must do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I do not feel myself a victim, this story is the part of my past now.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it but I do not feel sorry for myself.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I finished school this year entered a medical university in Vladikavkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I will learn to be a heart surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was to go in the army.</seg>
<seg id="134">I wanted to be a military man, but my health did not let me.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country but it will not happen.</seg>

<seg id="138">Miraculous: Georgy Farniyev was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege but still managed to survive</seg>
<seg id="139">As the siege was underway, he was pictured trapped inside the gym, sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a murderous terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="140">It is truly a miracle he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">'We feel as if it was just yesterday,' said Georgy, who wanted to train as an intelligence officer in the FSB, but was unable to because of damage to his health in the siege.</seg>
<seg id="142">It is still with me, this is not something I left behind.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now and people use to say children easily cope with bad experience - I must say this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">'In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I did feel a bit better afterwards but I can't forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when I went inside the gym again.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I would never ever go there again and please don't ask me to show where I sat in that well-known picture.</seg>

<seg id="150">My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I do not like to think or discuss it and they never asked me about the school.</seg>
<seg id="152">In terms of physical condition I am well.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful with my knee which was injured but I walk fine now.</seg>
<seg id="154">Still my health did not let me go and study in FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.</seg>
<seg id="155">I sent my documents, including medical papers, and they replied it was not possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have completed two years there.</seg>
<seg id="158">He is learning to treat all animals 'from cats to cows'.</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: 'I know I would never tell my children about my experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">This is not something children should know about, and of course not something they should experience.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother Marina, 42, said: 'This pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets close.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go and attend ceremonies being held to mark it.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know Georgy won't go.</seg>
<seg id="165">It must be even stronger for him because he was there and I was not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home, not able to help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me.Here in Beslan the imprint is on everyone.</seg>
<seg id="168">It stays with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Georgy is an adult now but that horror is still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is hard to accept it when something so terribly unfair happens to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he likes sports but he can't take part because of his knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several surgeries, he walks but cannot exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say he 50% overcame this horror, but one can never completely overcome and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This horrible experience will stay with us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege, and it only adds to my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost many people I knew well and they were dear for me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could do for me but my heart aches about those killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know families where new children were born, but also widows who never married again.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want it.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget my heart jumping out of my chest at the moment I saw him in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">Now I look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">What are those people fighting for?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why are they killing each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We used to be one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children are suffering, I am sure many children were already killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we could only grab all the rebels and throw them away - as far away as possible.</seg>

<seg id="192">The world gasped in 2004 when baby Alyona was carried out of the Beslan siege cradled in the arms of a Russian policeman.</seg>
<seg id="193">Terrorists let her go but cruelly kept her 30 year old mother, ten year old older sister Kristina, and brother Makhar in the school gym.</seg>
<seg id="194">Makhar, then three, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.</seg>
<seg id="195">Her father Ruslan has since remarried and with his new wife Svetlana he has a baby girl, who he named Kristina after the daughter he lost.</seg>

<seg id="4">Third place is confirmation of the considerably high level of our team.</seg>
<seg id="5">It’s nice that the French and even the Americans only have a slight advantage over us.</seg>
<seg id="6">It needs to be taken into account that we did not prepare for these competitions.</seg>
<seg id="7">The season is over and we didn’t want to compel our top athletes to compete in the DecaNation meet.</seg>
<seg id="8">Over the past few years, we have come in second at this tournament, but this year, we have a brand new team.</seg>
<seg id="9">The French, on the other hand, came into it with a battle-worthy team, including 13 European champions.</seg>
<seg id="10">They didn’t hide their intention to win this year, speaking about it publicly on several occasions.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips for better underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you're interested in shooting photos or video underwater, you have a variety of equipment choices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both go for around $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I shot these photos at a family party using several cameras, all priced under $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what gear you use, a few rules apply for getting the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Double-check your gear.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera's battery and other compartments are tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Also, set your camera to match the type of photos or video you'll be shooting.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders have scene or shooting modes that will optimize the exposure for dim undersea settings.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in, know how deep your equipment can go.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are rated to only 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Check out our buying guide and Ratings for digital cameras for both conventional and waterproof models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Take multiple shots - because many of them won't work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point-and-shoot cameras have LCDs to help you compose photos, while action cams generally don't.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have an LCD, it's going to hard to see it underwater, and composing your shot will be a hit-or-miss process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So shoot multiples.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera has a bracket mode, which shoots a burst of shots at slightly different exposure settings, take advantage of it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay near the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">Light falls off dramatically the deeper you dive underwater.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay close to the surface when you shoot in a pool, a lake or the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">This will also allow you to capture more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you'll see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Get close to your subjects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is great advice for shooting on dry land, but it is even more important underwater because of the dim lighting conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's particularly important if you're shooting with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed, wide angle lens, which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the picture frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose force of personality could shake things up, even in a gargantuan organisation like the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">A consultant anaesthetist, he devoted his career to sparing the sick both the agonies of illness and the torments of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who sought him out, his wife remembers, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the crippling after-effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson understood that while doctors are captivated by diagnoses and diseases, those being treated are overwhelmingly concerned with something else entirely: pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have not felt myself," he wrote in May that year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I've had difficulty in energising myself.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found himself impatiently berating his wife, Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want everything to happen sooner rather than later," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet went away on business for a week, Lawson found himself unusually, and unaccountably, upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was up.</seg>
<seg id="12">He got a colleague to perform a chest X-ray.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks earlier he had been skiing in the French Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the X-ray came back.</seg>
<seg id="15">He had mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lining of the lung.</seg>
<seg id="16">With most cancers, it is hard to know the exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Though some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer sufferers have smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But mesothelioma is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost every case, the cause is exposure to asbestos - a fibrous building material once dubbed "miraculous," but now known to be mortally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us, mesothelioma has been an easy disease to ignore.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, after all, is a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when a voluntary industry ban came into effect.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it was used, only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pipe laggers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">An industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such complacency is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is today at the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more mesothelioma deaths here than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">With an annual toll of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die of the disease as die in accidents in motor vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mesothelioma annual deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason that we are feeling its deadly effects now is that, though asbestos use has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), it usually takes decades for mesothelioma to develop.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the mesothelioma scourge is not confined to veterans of industrial building jobs.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, embedded in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we are educated in, and the stores we shop in.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma is no respecter of class, wealth, occupation, or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The bastions of privilege, from smart London department stores to public schools, have proved no refuge.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Houses of Parliament are riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even the hospitals that are meant to make us better have been reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nor was he a pipe lagger.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he struggled to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he put his finger on it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital where I spent six years training," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">Everybody - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used the tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question to which, sadly, he was able to provide a partial answer.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of four doctors who trained at Guy's Hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one left alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us will get this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died, on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">To survive so long is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty per cent of mesothelioma sufferers are dead 8 months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So now we can only echo Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, our best guess is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should have played itself out, some 90,000 people will have died.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most currently have no idea that they will die this way.</seg>
<seg id="55">An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick glance at the reports from the courts, where those affected often turn for compensation, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma has spread.</seg>
<seg id="57">This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, supervising clothes sections at two sites - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Allen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now she has two children in their 20s.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never would have dreamed that I would be affected by it.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people do know much about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos describes not one substance but a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "asbestiform" - which describes the fibrous structure which endows them with strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of the six, three have commonly been used in the building trade.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, commonly known as White Asbestos, is by far the most frequently found in buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was used in roofing panels, floor tiles, pipe insulation, boiler seals, even brake linings in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it's still considered a "major health hazard" that can kill by the EU and WHO.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, are Brown Asbestos (amosite) and Blue Asbestos (crocidolite).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of Brown Asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major cause of the uniquely high mesothelioma rate [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">A Marks & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at its flagship store in Oxford Street, London Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice Allen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is far from uncommon.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has produced a study of sufferers which suggests that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas with no known occupational or domestic exposure were probably caused by environmental asbestos exposure."</seg>
<seg id="75">Much of that exposure, he says, is due to "normal occupation and weathering" of our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can be sure that they are safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report from Goddard Consulting, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of government, might have been exposed unawares.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009 Goddard reported that service shafts and piping ducts behind Parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be disturbed by something as innocuous as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">MPs are frequently accused of looking after their own interests, but in this case it seems the opposite may have been true.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the Parliamentary Works Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had been given "a clean bill of health," it is now accepted £1bn of work lasting several years is required to overhaul Parliament, upgrading electrics and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election MPs may sit in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than on the Green Benches at Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard report noted that "the presence of asbestos has not been managed in accordance with the various regulations."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know if this mismanagement will cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All anyone can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One person who has never been able to pinpoint his exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a GP.</seg>
<seg id="85">Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I have worked at a hospital where positive asbestos claims have been made," he says, "But I can't prove it in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places one has worked in, and the dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">What he remembers clearly is the day early in December in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a fever.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and in the middle of a late evening surgery.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I started feeling shivery.</seg>
<seg id="91">It came on very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt dreadful.</seg>
<seg id="93">I didn't think I was going to be able to drive all the way home.</seg>
<seg id="94">Being a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the pleura, the lining around his lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">But like Janice Allen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="96">He ended up spending a month off work.</seg>
<seg id="97">Puzzled doctors gave him chest X-rays, and administered pleural catheters to draw off fluid from the lungs and send it for assessment.</seg>
<seg id="98">Yet the condition went undiagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="99">Slowly his health improved and he went back to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he took exercise and was breathing hard.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of Abbott's patients arrived at his GP's surgery with similar symptoms to him, and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then Abbott didn't make the connection with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">After all, his patient was decades older, and had worked directly asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The link in that case was clear.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his consultant took his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started feeling unwell, a probe, equipped with a camera, was fed into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I tend just to plod along," he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">I hadn't worried about it too much to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, was worrying.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly Abbott was plunged into meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he should get in touch with a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">That was when he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos was widely used, particularly in big public buildings which quite often had asbestos lagging on the pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who were exposed to asbestos in those buildings are now coming down with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">So mesothelioma is now affecting younger people not in the typical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous asbestos-lagged pipes in hospitals were below ground level, so patients are unlikely to have been affected.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many staff, walking in pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or eating in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott frequently did) almost certainly did come into contact with the toxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were potentially life-saving places for patients, but life-threatening places for the doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It is still being removed today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Pupils perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats</seg>
<seg id="123">And it is not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was frequently used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls for its marvellous insulating and flame-retarding properties.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact many people will have been first exposed to asbestos in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Up and down the country, in myriad chemistry lessons, pupils have perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="128">Websites have sprung up to address the issue of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, items as innocuous as floor tiles or shed roofs have routinely contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It's an industrial poison built into large amounts of our housing stock," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his case against Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case the only contact the woman sufferer could think of was pulling down a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful how you pull down the garden shed.</seg>
<seg id="133">The impact of diagnosis, knowing that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"It takes a while to sink in," says Graham Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to carry on but realised that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I was at the surgery for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realised that I would have to leave and sort myself out.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I won't see Christmas again</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the hardest things was moving from the position of doctor to that of patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling bewildered by the amount of information to get to grips with.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was hard to take everything in," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my consultant "How long do I have?"</seg>
<seg id="143">I was quoted about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember thinking "Well, I won't see Christmas again.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's it.""</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly pernicious, because it is the mechanics of how we stay alive - the very act of breathing - that causes the cancer that kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most Mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is made up of tiny fibres.</seg>
<seg id="149">When the asbestos is disturbed and the fibres are inhaled, they can become embedded in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibres irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem comes from inhaled needle-shaped fibres of asbestos," Professor Tom Treasure, a cardio-thoracic surgeon who moved in 2001 to Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="152">The very hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading centre in treating mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson, and treated some others who are likely to have been exposed while training at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">Once the asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, "the act of breathing pushes them on the periphery, which is where the lining is.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is by its nature invasive from the very beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">The normal options for treating other forms of cancer work less well with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some feel it is worth trying.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't excise the pleura," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">You can't get your knife round it.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile the cancer "is not very responsive to chemotherapy," which "has an effect" but does not cure.</seg>
<seg id="163">"Every now and again you get long survivors," says Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Happily, some patients do live far, far beyond expectations.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two-and-a-half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still battling on.</seg>
<seg id="168">After contacting mesothelioma Abbott was put in touch with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and advice bureau for fellow sufferers.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Hello, Cancer Central," he would announce cheerily when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="171">He had been diagnosed 4 years before and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Initially, Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months, and likely prolong his life by just one month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I felt desperate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I felt like giving up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, "managed to put a slightly better tint on things."</seg>
<seg id="176">After seeing several consultants, Abbott decided to pursue his treatment with Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski, professor in thoracic surgery at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I didn't have to be referred, I just rang them up and they saw me," Graham admits.</seg>
<seg id="178">The average patient would have to get a referral and have funding approved.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is crucial for those with mesothelioma to pursue the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when those treatments eventually, inevitably, fail, many sufferers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they turn to the courts in pursuit of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is noxious to health since 1898," says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what changed in the 1960s is that it was realised that even very low levels could be a risk to health.</seg>
<seg id="185">That is where company negligence came in.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full-value settlement" since Lawson could not prove definitively that his mesothelioma was down to asbestos exposure at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the inquest into his death, a spokesman for Guy's did confirm, however, that "the asbestos in the basement area concerned was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">That was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, pinning lethal asbestos exposure on one company or place of work - usually decades after the fact - has proved a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have changed hands or gone out of business.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance records may have been lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side, which the claimants certainly do not.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year has seen major new legislation which makes it easier for those with mesothelioma to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be traced.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law has created a £350m pot of money, funded by the insurance industry, for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases sufferers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court might have awarded in a normal compensation case - about £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims to the scheme are expected each year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many involved with mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350m represents "a very good job" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers" he says, suggesting that the sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the passage of time had not intervened, and mesothelioma sufferers were able to track down companies and sue them in the normal way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Penning, then Works and Pensions minister, admitted that the law was "not perfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning and Morgan admit that, with seven victims dying each day, quick action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People are suffering so much, and need help today," said Penning during the Mesothelioma Bill's second reading in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After their initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski advised surgery which, in contrast to Tom Treasure, he believes has a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a tri-therapy for which Lang-Lazdunski can boast five year survival rates as high as 40 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt empowered.</seg>
<seg id="207">"That of course is one of the most important things," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see it in patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is some drive that keeps you going.</seg>
<seg id="210">When you give up you can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott went in for surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he had completed the last of his six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">Follow-up scans revealed no sign of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had my scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There was multiple spotting [of cancer] around my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I was just about to turn 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">It's not life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">It's life ending.</seg>
<seg id="219">Once again Abbott put himself through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no sign of the tumours.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is both physically and emotionally gruelling.</seg>
<seg id="222">You have to think about practical things - about the finances when I'm gone for example, or showing my wife how the boiler timer works.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news you start getting negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">You have to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It's hard as a parent," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is difficult to know what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I was first diagnosed I told the girls that I had a condition that meant I wasn't going to become old.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is very sociable and boisterous.</seg>
<seg id="231">She told her friends and we got lots of calls very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more reserved.</seg>
<seg id="233">She didn't say much.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such conversations are something that all cancer patients must face.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for mesothelioma sufferers such discussions are not leavened by hope, by even a glimmer of a possibility of survival.</seg>
<seg id="236">The disease carries with it (even as it did, eventually, for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.</seg>
<seg id="237">As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life threatening.</seg>

<seg id="243">Modern commercial asbestos use begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even bank notes) and cloth.</seg>
<seg id="244">Major asbestos mines open in Canada and South Africa, and soon after in America, Itlay and Russia.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong right to choose leaders; protesters vow vengeance</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday against letting Hong Kong voters nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing agitation for democratic reform.</seg>
<seg id="3">The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision by China's National People's Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to weed out any candidates not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not unexpected, but it is still infuriating," said legislator Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not what Beijing promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They've lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it's clear we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending China's ruling, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said allowing public nominations in the election for Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing had promised to allow the region's residents to vote for the chief executive beginning in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese leaders presented the Sunday ruling as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kongers a direct vote, but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders would retain a firm hold on the process through a nominating committee tightly controlled by Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new clause, only candidates who "love the country, and love Hong Kong" would be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ruling comes after a summer that has featured some of the largest and most high-profile protests in Hong Kong in years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not grant authentic universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday night, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had assembled in the rain outside the Hong Kong government's headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the demonstration, organizers said that their movement was entering a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would mount waves of protests in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, they did not give details, apparently looking to avoid problems with authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In an online statement, organizers said the movement "has considered occupying Central only as the last resort, an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are very sorry to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of Central will definitely happen.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security was tight Sunday at the government headquarters, with police and barricades deployed.</seg>
<seg id="21">Driving the unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">An influx of mainlanders is fueling competition for products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to bend under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong - at risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest they are talking about, it could result in much economic damage, depending on how many are involved and for how long," said legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want concern to spread that Hong Kong is getting out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is a perception that is bad for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">China's state-run media also has run stories in recent days painting Hong Kong's democracy activists as agents of subversion directed by Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights that drew 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in July, tens of thousands turned out for one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.</seg>

<seg id="1">US prom culture hits university life with freshers offered private jet entrances</seg>
<seg id="2">We're excited to be answering this demand by launching the UK's first luxurious travel service for the students of today.</seg>
<seg id="3">To make the maximum impact arriving at university, the company also offers transport options including private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Stewart also claimed the service had a safety aspect.</seg>
<seg id="5">The service is an ideal alternative for students who would usually have to haul their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.</seg>
<seg id="6">Paired with our new VIF options, we're looking forward to ensuring this year students reach university with minimum fuss and maximum luxury.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesman for the company said that because the service has just launched there have been no bookings yet but added that "students will be booking the service over the next few weeks."</seg>
<seg id="8">The company also said that despite students facing tuition fees of £9,000 a year, it still expected to find a market for the service.</seg>
<seg id="9">Students of today are quite different in terms of expectations and aspirations, compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression and VIF is just the way to do that.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the National Union of Students criticised the service as out of touch.</seg>
<seg id="11">Megan Dunn, NUS vice president for higher education, said: "This scheme seems incredibly out of touch with the lives of the majority of students.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many students starting university this month are facing a cost of living crisis, with available financial support in loans and grants failing to keep pace with spiralling bills for basic essentials, before they can even start thinking about forking out thousands of pounds for something as simple arriving at their halls of residence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists take on race and police conduct post-Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Attendees hold their hands up while chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," as they wait in line before the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo. over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, white feminist commenters prioritized gender above race when it came to pushing forward reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">But as tensions rose in the Midwest and drew nationwide coverage, Perez saw responses from white women that centered 100 percent around race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared to the responses of black women soon after the shooting on August 9, the personal essays with titles like "thoughts on ferguson as a white woman" and "Feminism Is Not Just About Women's Oppression" came relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But to Perez, it demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think you get a lot of people talking about whiteness and privilege in such a high level way," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People felt called to voice something about what happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's very emblematic of the crisis we face and because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racialized, they have to call that out.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light issues that black American women face every day but that aren't seen as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can post something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and it will get 150 likes from all over the place," said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">"How is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere?" she asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues regarding race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">To her, black women have not had the luxury of neatly separating the issues; they live the combined reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women are now combining issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist spheres, Angela Hattery, women and gender studies professor at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">You needed the white woman to be complicit in the narrative to justify the lynching.</seg>
<seg id="21">To Hattery, the breakdown between white and black women came when white suffragists like Susan B. Anthony surveyed the landscape in the late 1800s and saw that the fight for voting rights would only work for one group at a time: women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They made the decision to put their eggs in the basket for votes for women and votes for Blacks would come later," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="23">To look back at things like that gives us a powerful perspective on why women of color don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We haven't done a good job.</seg>
<seg id="25">We haven't helped black women protect their husbands and sons ever.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to organize against lynching as the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group came nearly 40 years after black women originally asked for assistance, said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">To Mitchell, the upswell of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police conduct, racial discrimination - reflect the times white feminists have had to play "catch up" to issues black women have grappled with for generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have those [traditional feminist] platforms took as seriously the right to raise a child as they did their right to have birth control?" posed Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">Second wave feminists who made careers out of fighting for reproductive rights and access to birth control are now figuring out what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">Noted white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's shooting to post a pointed column by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll that demanded more protest from white Americans on the issue of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope women, who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger that is located in the body - and racial opinions that are measurably different in public polls - will lead the change," Steinem wrote.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem has vouched for a more intersectional feminism that includes issues of race as well as gender, her comments on race in America still puzzle some.</seg>
<seg id="34">American Enterprise Institute scholar Christina Sommers, author of "Who Stole Feminism?," told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson counter the criticism she has launched in the past.</seg>
<seg id="35">We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate growth of the electric vehicle market</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce a plan to the government for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, Deputy Director of a Department at the Ministry, Oleg Pluzhnikov, said at a roundtable organized by Vedomosti at a Moscow car dealership in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan was drafted by order of the government and one of its main goals is reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September or the beginning of October, Pluzhnikov says, the proposed measures deal with electric vehicles and hybrids – a development plan for transport vehicles that use natural gas motor fuel already exists in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The plan (Vedomosti has a copy) is intended for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">The development of assessment criteria for electric and hybrid transport vehicles and a decision on how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly transport vehicles still lies ahead.</seg>
<seg id="7">The report to the government, which will include tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; a plan for preferential financing and preferential leasing will emerge by April 2015; and proposals on price reductions for cars, stimulus for localization, and the creation of service infrastructure will be prepared by October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, it is expected that changes to laws and regulation will be introduced to simplify conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, at gas stations, and so on).</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, federal civil servants intend, over the course of 2015, to formulate proposals for regional authorities, so that they can also stimulate the use of environmentally friendly transport – in terms of providing such types of transport with preferential treatment on the roads and for parking; and by February 2016, proposals on the expansion of state procurements of this type of transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development, already by October 2014, will introduce a list of criteria to assess the activities of regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of environmentally friendly transport and the development of charging infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="11">The electric vehicle market in Russia is only just developing – in 2013, around 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the entire country.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the beginning of 2014, the import duty on electric vehicles was reduced to zero, and, as such, sales will amount to approximately 500 units, predicts Chief Executive Officer for Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.</seg>
<seg id="13">But even a fivefold increase won’t make electric vehicles anymore noticeable: according to data from the Association of European Business, 2.78 mln. light motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles into Russia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Renault is preparing to start imports – the company is focusing primarily on corporate clients, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships for Renault in Russia, Nikolai Remiz.</seg>
<seg id="16">The majority of other producers of electric vehicles have taken a wait-and-see position as concerns Russia.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even Russian producers have developed electric vehicles – GAZ – but output is pitiful.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, according to ASM Holding’s data, between January and July, 2014, AvtoVAZ produced 30 electric vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="19">Demand is low because of the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the Director for Engineering at AvtoVAZ, Sergei Amanov, without state support there will be no breakthrough in this segment….</seg>
<seg id="20">Development of the Russian market of electric vehicles, in addition to the high cost of the cars (the electric vehicles that are sold in Russia are, on average, twice as expensive as their counterparts with internal combustion engines), is being constrained by the underdevelopment of charging infrastructure (charging stations are few and far between), sighs General Director of Avtostat, Sergei Tselikov.</seg>
<seg id="21">Owing to the high cost and slow rate at which production costs are declining, electric vehicles will remain a niche segment over the next 3-4 years, forecasts the Editor-in Chief of AvtoReview, Mikhail Podorozhansky, and Tselikov agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Auto producers, on the other hand, say that certain models of electric automobiles are already close in price to regular ones.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market for electric vehicles has good prospects, the most important thing is to instil confidence in consumers that the electric vehicle is a reality; this will in part be accomplished by the appearance of all the new charging stations, emphasizes the President of BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects are already being implemented, for example, by state company Rosseti: in Moscow several stations have already been built, and soon there will be another 80 or so.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negotiations on the construction of a network of charging stations are currently underway in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the Director of a Department at Rosseti, Vladimir Sofin, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build charging stations throughout the country, but there are some problems: the small amount of electric automobiles in the country and the absence of a universal charging standard for all brands of electric vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="27">Moreover, as a distribution company, Rosseti doesn’t have the right to sell electricity, and the possibility of doing so in terms of charging electric vehicles is still being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="28">Pankov believes that the most effective state measure to support the development of an electric vehicle market in Russia is the removal of customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">The zero duty rate will be in place until the end of 2014, and the possibility of its extension, as well as an extension of the subsidy list, are being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The replacement of the transport tax with an environmental one (the idea is being discussed and would concern all vehicles) will also support the market, but not as substantially as customs preferences, Pankov reckons.</seg>
<seg id="31">The transport tax in Russia isn’t very high, says Pankov, in contrast with Norway, for example, where a lowering of the tax resulted in rapid growth in the sales of electric vehicles – they now account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, stimulus measures are also needed for automobile owners; for example, free parking in the centre of the city (as has already been done in Moscow), Pankov is certain, or the ability of electric automobiles to travel in a specially-designated lane, which is something Russia still doesn’t have.</seg>

<seg id="1">Captured fighters from the Donbass battalion are being dealt with in Donetsk Oblast.</seg>
<seg id="2">The assailants were encircled outside of Ilovaisk.</seg>
<seg id="3">Their own commanders betrayed them, and dozens of security forces were killed under fire.</seg>
<seg id="4">They say that those who survived wouldn’t have gone to fight if they had known about the actual situation in the southeast of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="5">You might call the 108 captives lucky.</seg>
<seg id="6">The assailants from the Donbass battalion were still alive after the “bloodbath” they stumbled into outside of Ilovaisk.</seg>
<seg id="7">They spent several days surrounded by fighters from the Donetsk People’s Republic army, basically abandoned by their commanders and authorities in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="8">When command headquarters announced that it was possible to leave the “ring” through an allegedly granted corridor, the column made a move.</seg>
<seg id="9">But after just a few minutes, the sound of shells and bullets could be heard from all directions.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Judging by the information that they gave me, we had a corridor that they were going to let us leave by”, recalls the Temporary Deputy Commander of the battalion, who goes by the nom-de-guerre, “Lermontov”.</seg>
<seg id="11">But when we started to descend between Mnogopolye and Chervonoselsk, the cross-fire coming from anti-tank guided missiles, "zushka" rocket-propelled artillery systems, 30mm grenade launchers, BMD automatic guns, and small arms began.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were four vehicles travelling in front of me and three behind, but when it was all said and done, there were only two vehicles left.</seg>
<seg id="13">The officer calling himself “Lermontov” recalls how, almost immediately, no fewer than 60 people were killed, dozens were wounded, many of whom later died.</seg>
<seg id="14">The surviving fighters are currently receiving medical treatment from the very ones who came to kill them.</seg>
<seg id="15">Now, the captives are surprised that these so-called “terrorists” are treating them well, giving them food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="16">Whereas, in contrast, their own commanders essentially deceived them, sentencing them to a certain death.</seg>
<seg id="17">We were quite simply betrayed, they say.</seg>
<seg id="18">The column, the whole battalion, was sent to the slaughter.</seg>
<seg id="19">Aleksei, like many of his comrades, volunteered to join the Donbass battalion, given how Ukrainian news was describing the atrocities that were allegedly being caused by the “separatists” in Southeastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here, Aleksei finally saw a very different picture.</seg>
<seg id="21">His mother was killed in Luhansk, not just by anyone, but by Ukrainian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="22">A friend phoned me, and told me that a mortar attack was underway, and that it was most likely the Ukrainian armed forces, recounts one of the soldiers, Aleksei.</seg>
<seg id="23">After that, I wanted to leave the battalion.</seg>
<seg id="24">They wouldn’t let us leave Ilovaisk, they said that we were surrounded.</seg>
<seg id="25">I had already come to an agreement with my commander, and had already written a discharge report.</seg>
<seg id="26">They transported the whole lot of us straight from Zurakhovo to Ilovaisk.</seg>
<seg id="27">According to the captives, 300-350 people were stuck in the “trap” outside of Ilovaisk.</seg>
<seg id="28">Now, some of the survivors admit that if they could turn back time, they wouldn’t have joined the counterinsurgency battalion under any circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="29">The rebels handed over all of the captives to DPR security forces.</seg>
<seg id="30">Each of them is being checked for their participation in war crimes.</seg>

<seg id="9">To recap, on July 18, two oil storage tanks were burnt down and two storage buildings were destroyed in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansky oil refinery plant.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Lisichansky oil refinery plant is the main petroleum refinery in Ukraine, the first phase of which was put into operation in October 1976.</seg>
<seg id="11">General output for the Lisichansky oil refinery plant amounts to almost 7 mln. tonnes of oil stock per year.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is capable of producing Euro-4 standard fuel as well as batches of Euro-5 diesel fuel.</seg>
<seg id="13">In March 2012, the delivery of oil to the Lisichansky oil refinery plant was halted due to its unprofitability.</seg>

<seg id="14">Case, however, published an image showing how an event can change depending on how you take and process a photograph of it.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the interview with Kill Screen, Case explained how he came up with the idea for this game quite a while ago, however, he had originally wanted to base it not on protests in the USA, but on events in the Gaza strip.</seg>
<seg id="16">After starting to collect information for the game, the game designer admitted that he didn’t have enough knowledge or expertise to portray the history of the region.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, when he saw how the media was presenting the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nicky Case is an independent designer who produces browser games.</seg>
<seg id="19">Coming Out Simulator, which was released in 2014, became his is best-known project.</seg>
<seg id="20">This game, which addresses events from Case’s own biography, focuses on how a bisexual teenager attempts to tell his homophobic parents about his relationships.</seg>

<seg id="2">With an appeal to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims, Ukraine’s Minister of Defence, Valery Heletey, drags the people into a continuation of bloodshed, reads a statement from the Russian MFA.</seg>
<seg id="3">“In Moscow, of course, we took note of the statements made by the head of the Ukrainian military agency, Valery Heletey, who spoke about the ‘completion of operations to liberate the East of Ukraine from the terrorists’ and about the beginning of a ‘Great Patriotic War’, the losses of which would be counted in the ‘tens of thousands’.</seg>
<seg id="4">The degree of appropriateness of the head of the Ukrainian military agency, who published the aforementioned post on his Facebook page, is a subject for analysis by specialists outside of the military sphere”, reads the statement by Russian diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="5">They find it hard to believe that the minister of defence of a civilized state could make such statements.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Monday, Ukraine’s Minister of Defence wrote the following on his Facebook page: “According to unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times to use tactical nuclear weapons against us if we continue to resist”.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, he stated that “the operation to liberate the east of Ukraine” was complete.</seg>

<seg id="3">Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tire blew out on lap 172, ending his night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Stewart drove his battered car to the garage and then exited without speaking to reporters.</seg>
<seg id="5">His crew chief Chad Johnston said the 14 team was disappointed, but will now start focusing on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="4">Higher salaries are also among a list of requests due to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.</seg>

<seg id="2">General Prayuth (on the right) appointed Pravit Vongsuwan (on the left) to the post of Minister of Defence</seg>
<seg id="3">The military governor and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prayuth Chan-ocha announced the composition of the new cabinet of ministers for the country, in which more than a third of positions are held by either generals or retired generals.</seg>
<seg id="4">Members of the army received key positions: ministers of defence, finance, foreign affairs, and trade.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Monday, Prayuth Chan-ocha was officially confirmed in the position of prime minister, following official approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of the head of the interim military government to that post.</seg>
<seg id="6">The 60 year-old military man, who seized control of the country following a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for the post of prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="7">He was chosen as the prime minister during a session of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="8">Earlier, the army appointed the members of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Prayuth Chan-ocha, a coup was the only way to ensure stability.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was preceded by six-month long demonstrations, in which those protesting demanded the resignation of the government’s Prime Minister, Yingluck Shinawatra.</seg>
<seg id="11">Officially, Prayuth Chan-ocha will be the temporary prime minister, since army leaders plan to hold general elections at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, there are concerns that military leaders plan to consolidate their power over the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">The army came to power on May 22</seg>
<seg id="14">against the backdrop of a totally paralysed civil government.</seg>
<seg id="15">The leaders of the main political parties were subjected to temporary arrest.</seg>
<seg id="16">Immediately following the military leaders’ seizure of power, they began the temporary arrest of the country’s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.</seg>
<seg id="17">Those arrested included several journalists and public figures.</seg>
<seg id="18">The current political crisis traces its roots back to 2006, when the army removed Yingluck Shinawatra’s brother, Thaksin, from his post as prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="19">Both of them are popular with the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which brought them success several times at the polls.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, many members of the middle class and the elite in the capital joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralysed the country since November 2013.</seg>

<seg id="1">No one told you that the mussels would be better in a salad, I didn’t promise you that, joked the waitress from the new Palm brasserie.</seg>
<seg id="2">It must be formally recognized that this is indeed the case, but the mind and the stomach remain adamant.</seg>
<seg id="3">After all, everyone knows that when we say “Belgium”, we mean mussels, and when we say “mussels”, we mean “Belgium”.</seg>
<seg id="4">Restaurants love to sagaciously proclaim that the success of an establishment is dependent on three factors: location, location, and, once again, location.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are certain places that are not just well, but rather superbly located, and yet they are still unlucky.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a word, having sat down at a table at Palm, I remembered how, some time ago, this used to be the site of a café called Gorodok (in tribute to the television show of the same name), then there was Odessa Mama, as well as the restaurant, Beaujolis, and the Druzhba beer hall.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now there is another beer hall here, but this time it’s not a nostalgic soviet-style one, but Belgian.</seg>
<seg id="8">Above ground is just the tip of the iceberg – a bar counter and a few tables – the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="9">But still, it is pleasant here, like a child’s bedroom: red, yellow, and green walls, different coloured chairs, and, in place of a window, a television that shows mermaids swimming.</seg>
<seg id="10">Belgian establishments are far from new in Saint Petersburg, so there is something to compare this one to.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are eight types of beers on tap here (260-300 roubles for 0.5L) and countless numbers of bottled ones (170-1550 roubles).</seg>
<seg id="12">A sociable and friendly waitress happily presents me with a menu, while telling me that “mussels are large filling seeds”, and here it should be noted that the service, in spite of other shortcomings, is the best feature of Palm.</seg>
<seg id="13">The menu contains what one might expect, but the preparation of the dishes is often rather unexpected.</seg>
<seg id="14">For example, who would be able to predict that the Meat Roll with Walloon plums (280 roubles) was actually a carpaccio, that, moreover, was so thinly sliced that parchment paper would seem to be an outrageously thick material in comparison.</seg>
<seg id="15">The only way to be able to detect some sort of flavour would be to shove half the plate into your mouth all at once.</seg>
<seg id="16">The salads are even worse.</seg>
<seg id="17">It would be fair to call the Classic Salade Liegeoise (260) a crime against the Belgian people: some sort of withered-up iceberg lettuce, potato that was boiled some very long while ago, soggy Kenyan beans, overly hard pieces of bacon, plus, for some reason, pickled onion.</seg>
<seg id="18">You wouldn’t wish this salade liegeoise on your worst enemy!</seg>
<seg id="19">The list of ingredients for the Belgian Salad was a bit different, but the impression it made was no more positive.</seg>
<seg id="20">If it was possible to turn a blind eye to the unripened quartered cherry tomatoes and over-fried mushrooms, it was impossible to ignore the mussels that looked as if they had been boiled and refrozen several times during their lifetime!</seg>
<seg id="21">After all, I already know that absolutely normal White Sea mussels are available here!</seg>
<seg id="22">They are served in small pots “with your choice of sauce” (490-560 for 0.5 kg).</seg>
<seg id="23">Out of half a dozen sauces, the one made with white wine, celery, and carrots honestly wasn’t a success.</seg>
<seg id="24">There were vegetables in the sauce, but no aroma, and whether or not there actually was any wine in the sauce remains a mystery.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the plus side, the frites with homemade mayonnaise served alongside the mussels were good.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Chicken Waterzooi served here is not a broth, but so thick that, depending on your mood, you might decide you have either a first or a main course in front of you – it’s simply a nice creamy soup.</seg>
<seg id="27">It was stated that the local chef prepares the rabbit in a beer sauce, but nothing was said about rosemary.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the situation turned out to be the diametric opposite: the rosemary took over the whole dish.</seg>
<seg id="29">I was given the impression that this rabbit was exclusively fed rosemary bushes throughout its life, and, as a result, its meat had taken on a highly unusual aroma.</seg>
<seg id="30">But, at the same time, the rabbit leg was served with a wonderful – no, utterly outstanding – pear in a caramelized crust.</seg>
<seg id="31">Palm offers not only sweet, but also savoury waffles with beef, chicken, or bacon and cheese (220-280).</seg>
<seg id="32">The maple syrup turned out to be too runny and the waffles were a bit dry.</seg>
<seg id="33">However, the manager came up to my table and rather casually asked about my impressions of the meal.</seg>
<seg id="34">That means it’s worth coming in another time.</seg>

<seg id="1">The dollar exchange rate on the MICEX rose to more than 37 roubles on news of new sanctions being prepared by the West in relation to Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2">This is a new historical record.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dollar rate for ‘tomorrow’ settlements rose by 26.9 kopeks to 37.02 roubles by 10:29 (MSK), while the euro exchange rate increased by 30 kopecks to 48.73 roubles, according to Moscow Exchange data.</seg>
<seg id="4">The bi-currency basket rose by 28 kopeks to the level of the previous closing and stood at 42.28 roubles.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the events in Crimea, the dollar hit its peak on February 19, 2009, when it stood at 36.43 roubles, but on March 3, 2014, it was already at 37.005 roubles.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the night of August 29, the White House announced that US President, Barack Obama, and German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, are discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weakening of the rouble against both the euro and the dollar is here for the long-term.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast suggested this mark, says Anna Bodrova, a Senior Analyst with Alpari.</seg>
<seg id="9">One way or another, everything associated with Ukraine will affect the exchange rate.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will respond to it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today there were rumours about a military incursion that were not substantiated by any side, but the market turned out to be highly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="12">All the talk about it being resistant to such kinds of news was proven wrong yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to experts, the week will close at around the levels of 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tax season has ended, the price of oil is weak, politics, sanctions, and difficulties with delivering gas through Ukraine – these are all a part of the same chain.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is also expected that inflation will soar: by fall, current prices will rise by between 5-10%.</seg>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the season for vegetables and fruits will soon end and a vacuum of sorts will appear while the network reorients to alternative suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="17">“The dollar went up to the 37 rouble mark, went over it, and then returned to its previous position – there is no overwhelming hysteria here, comments Konstantin Bushuev, Head of the Market Analysis Department at Otkritie Broker.</seg>
<seg id="18">Everyone will also be watching to see if the promised sanctions will be introduced on Saturday, as there will be a NATO meeting.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rouble, according to him, weakened sharply after the end of the tax season, then came the news about Ukraine, and, to top it off, the Central Bank announced last week that it will move to a fully floating rate by the end of the year and will renounce any kind of currency intervention.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you take a look at the daily fluctuations, they are in no way different from those previously seen over the course of this month; everyone was frightened by the 37 rouble mark, the analyst continued.</seg>
<seg id="21">But, in terms of volume, nothing spectacular occurred.</seg>
<seg id="22">I'll remind you of the anxious times in the currency market at the end of January, when there was an increased demand for foreign currency, as well as on the third of March, when the Central Bank sold off a record volume of foreign currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">But UFC Investment Company sees a positive side to the weakening rouble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First and foremost, this means growth for the revenue side of the budget from export operations, as well as an improvement to the competitive advantage of domestic producers as a result of the rising cost of imports, says Chief Analyst for UFC Investment Company, Aleksei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the downside, this may mean increased prices for imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency are significantly decreasing the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy and provoking an increase in inflationary pressures, which, as a consequence, has become a reason for the increased cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, slows the country’s economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we’re taking about the stock market, the depreciation of the rouble somewhat mitigates the decreasing price of stocks denominated in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">By way of example, during Thursday’s trading session, the MICEX index fell by 1.67%, but the RTS lost 3.27%.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of decline in the indices is explained by the weakening of the rouble by more than 1.5% over the course of the day.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the rouble has an emotional element to it, which explains the widespread rush to buy foreign currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">Experience shows that emotions will slowly fade away and the rouble’s listed price will either partly or fully recover its losses.</seg>
<seg id="32">“We suspect that, before long, we will see a ratio between the dollar and the Russian currency closer to the level of 36 roubles to the dollar”, Aleksei Kozlov remarks.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British woman says she spent many years thinking she was going to die after a misdiagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage life believing that she only had years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">She actually had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.</seg>
<seg id="5">Charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition.</seg>
<seg id="6">About 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have CMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, an awkward gait and curled toes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sufferers can also experience numbness or pain and the condition is incurable and progressive, meaning symptoms get worse over time.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Rodgers was 13 she was under the impression that she suffered from Friedreich's ataxia (FA) - a condition which had a very poor prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rodgers thought that she was going to be wheelchair bound by the time she was 18 and dead before she reached her 30s.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mother-of-two, who is now 51, said: "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.</seg>
<seg id="11">I was falling daily and everything took me longer to do.</seg>
<seg id="12">I could never roller-skate or skateboard with other kids and got bullied at school a lot because of the way I walked and ran.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rodgers said when she was aged 13, after several operations to release her Achilles tendons and straighten out her feet, she took a peak at her medical notes when her consultant left the room which said that she suffered from FA.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I felt guilty because I'd been nosy and so I didn't tell anybody, but I did come home, look up the condition at the library and wrote to the FA Association," she said.</seg>
<seg id="15">When I got the information back I was gobsmacked and in the worst state of panic possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and dead by the time I was 25 and in between gradually lose all my ability.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was going through this on my own and I planned my own funeral.</seg>
<seg id="18">She said by the time she reached 17 she realised that her walking abilities hadn't deteriorated as much as she thought they would have and asked her surgeon about it.</seg>
<seg id="19">He just stood up and hugged me and said 'my dear I don't think you have it, as you would be in a wheelchair now.'</seg>
<seg id="20">I think you have something a lot less life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="21">After some genetic testing she was found to have CMT.</seg>
<seg id="22">"When he explained what CMT was, I thought I'd drawn the lucky straw," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">A rebounding economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">State and local tax bills for companies across the country grew modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to new research released last week, and Washington-area firms were no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">District, Maryland and Virginia businesses collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">Businesses" state and local tax burdens last year expanded by 4.3 percent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after back-to-back years of shrinking bills in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes rose at a faster clip, 4.3 percent, than local levies, 3.9 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, a tax policy group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from firms.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, at 28 percent, generates the least amount of tax revenue, proportionately, from business.</seg>
<seg id="10">Much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a rebound in companies" real estate values, researchers say, which pushed property taxes up 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of sub-1 percent growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large share of those gains came from big states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears to be the same story in the Washington area as well.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively forked over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012 - year-over-year growth of 4.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent bounceback in property values isn't doing nearly as much to inflate state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of companies" tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and D.C. firms pay nearly half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their property, especially the tax base surrounding the D.C. area, is owned either by the government or by nonprofits, which don't pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">So Maryland is forced to rely much more heavily on, for example, its income taxes to pay for the same services you have in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent rebound in business tax revenue cannot all be attributed to the recovering real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Business incomes also appear to be on the mend, according to the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region reported state corporate income taxes of $2.3 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">While trending in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses isn't growing at the same pace in all three places.</seg>
<seg id="22">The District's rate of growth was level with the national average, at 4.3 percent, while Maryland's growth was substantially faster at 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia posted a below-average tax bill bump of 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax by far of the three jurisdictions (all of which have flat corporate rates) at 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Maryland's corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while the District's stands at a relatively high 9.975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia had lower state and local business taxes and an overall better business tax climate than Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">The District wasn't evaluated in the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite its advantage, Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering its corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, in line with Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state continues to meet revenue goals in the coming year, the law could push the state's business income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington region seem to be faring better and thus paying more state and local taxes, according to the recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - the pass-through structure by which most small firms are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia surged 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster rate of growth than overall business taxes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Researchers say that trend and the increase in business taxes nationwide are likely to continue this year, with overall sales tax revenue for state and local governments up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, the Washington area may lag behind as the slowdown in federal spending takes its toll on the region's labor market.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Bronze Age of Russian Judo</seg>
<seg id="2">The World Judo Championships held on home soil, brought Team Russia two silver and seven bronze medals.</seg>
<seg id="3">Given these results, the Russians only gave way to the competition’s main favourites – Team Japan.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, with the first day already bringing the Russian team a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The award’s winner was Beslan Mudranov, who was competing in the 60kg class.</seg>
<seg id="6">Furthermore, in the tied final fight with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the result of the match was decided by just one penalty, received by the Russian.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the second day of the tournament turned out to be the most successful for Team Russia – three medals were won on Tuesday alone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mikhail Pulyaev, competing in the men’s 66kg class, achieved a silver medal, and the bronze went to Kamal Khan-Magomedov.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the final fight, the Russian went up against the Japanese 2011 and 2013 World Champion, Masashi Ebinuma.</seg>
<seg id="10">Khan-Magomedov, having lost to his fellow countryman in the quarterfinals, successfully made it through repechage and won the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the women’s 52kg tournament, Natalia Kyzyutina made it to the third spot on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="12">She lost the semi-final to the current World Champion, Majlinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who competed under the flag of the International Judo Federation in this competition and successfully defended her title.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the fight for the bronze, Kyzyutina defeated Ma Yingnan from China, but after the tournament, she admitted that third place was not at all what she was expecting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Once again, Kelmendi, who earlier beat Kuzyutina in the final match of the European Championships, stood as an obstacle to the Russian’s road to gold.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Musa Mogushkov, competing in the 73kg class, added another bronze to Team Russia’s collection.</seg>
<seg id="16">His opponent in the quarterfinals was Viktor Skovortsov, a former representative of Moldova who now competes for Team UAE.</seg>
<seg id="17">But then, the Russian won two fights and became a medal winner.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mogushkov entered the home championships with an injured ankle, which he plans to rehabilitate in the near future, and is why he will take a break from competing.</seg>
<seg id="19">As concerns the ex-Moldovan competitor, Skvortsov, well he won himself a bronze medal in this tournament.</seg>
<seg id="20">Interestingly, his other fellow countryman, Ivan Remarenko, who also took on sporting citizenship from the UAE, likewise finished his competition in the 100kg class with a bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="21">The fourth day of the 2014 WC also brought the Russians one bronze, won by Ivan Nifontov in the 81kg class.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a difficult semi-final fight, he won against Frenchman, Alain Schmitt, as a result of a penalty against his opponent.</seg>
<seg id="23">On Friday, three groups of medals were up for grabs at the tournament, but the Russians, as per tradition, were limited to just one bronze in the men’s 90kg class tournament.</seg>
<seg id="24">The recipient was Kirill Voprosov, but Team Russia was guaranteed to win this medal: his opponent in the repechage final was fellow countryman, Kirill Denisov.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the actual fight was never held: Voprosov’s opponent wasn’t able to walk out onto the judo mat as a result of an injury.</seg>
<seg id="26">A men’s bronze was also won by the home team on the sixth day of the competition – it was added to the team’s collection by Renat Saidov, who competed in the over 100kg class.</seg>
<seg id="27">He achieved a clean win in the repechage final against the Brazilian, David Moura.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus ended the individual portion of the World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="29">On Sunday, the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, the titles of world champions in the team competitions were up for grabs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Both Russian teams – the men’s and the women’s – were amongst the top contenders for the award, but, as in the individual competitions, things didn’t work out for the representatives of the fairer sex – they didn’t achieve any medals.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the Russian male judokas won the team silver.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the deciding match of a hard-fought battle with a score of 2-3, they gave up first place to the competition favourites – Team Japan.</seg>
<seg id="33">Moreover, Team Russia was leading 2-0 after the clean fight victory of Khan-Magomedov and the comeback win by Denis Yartsev (in the 73kg class).</seg>
<seg id="34">However, in the heavier weight classes, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90), and Aslan Kambiev (100) weren’t able to defeat their Japanese opponents.</seg>
<seg id="35">The same scenario played out in the bronze medal match of the women’s tournament, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, ended up losing 2-3 to the Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="36">Russian President, Vladimir Putin, attended the team competitions in Chelyabinsk, and congratulated the men’s team with their silver medal following the closing of the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="37">“Second place is very honourable, but I want to say that it was obvious you could become champions, Putin said according to RIA Novosti.</seg>
<seg id="38">To lose to the Japanese, the pioneers of judo – there is no shame in this.</seg>
<seg id="39">But I am confident that you are also capable of beating them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Team Russia’s performance at the World Championships on home soil was much better than last year’s showing at competitions of a similar calibre held in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="41">At that time, the Russian team only managed to get three medals under its belt – one silver and two bronze.</seg>
<seg id="42">Moreover, this tournament was held without Olympian champions, Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev.</seg>
<seg id="43">Of course, we are all big maximalists.</seg>
<seg id="44">Yes, we want gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">But let’s remember that if a person ends up in the top eight of an Olympic cycle, then they are considered a contender for an Olympic medal.</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially, in a type of sport like judo”, Russian Minister of Sport, Vitaly Mutko, said in summing up the tournament, as reported by the press service for the Championships.</seg>
<seg id="47">As predicted, Team Japan came out on top in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various value, five of which turned out to be gold.</seg>
<seg id="48">The next World Championships will be held next summer in Astana.</seg>

<seg id="1">The kings can do it all</seg>
<seg id="2">The now on-sale debut album by the group, Royal Blood – the new hope for British rock – has taken rock duos from nightclubs straight into stadiums.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Royal Blood duo has only be on the stage for a year, but they have already managed to earn a nomination for a BBC music award, tour as the opening act for the Arctic Monkeys, and receive a visit from the one and only Jimmy Page in the dressing room at their New York concert.</seg>
<seg id="4">Their self-titled debut album has already received 100 thousand pre-orders several months ahead of its release, and the contract for its distribution belongs to one of the major labels – Warner Music.</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the sorry state of the current music industry, this situation is quite remarkable; after all, we’re not talking about the next Lana Del Rey or your run-of-the-mill, sweet-sounding representative of the “new R&B”, but about a moody-looking duo of Brits that plays with such a level of volume and intensity that hasn’t been in vogue for several decades.</seg>
<seg id="6">Overall, given everything mentioned above, the expectations for the first album were particularly high – and they have been fully justified already.</seg>
<seg id="7">The duo chose their name, which up until now one might only expect some desperate long-haired metalheads to take on, for good reason: it’s clear that they feel as if the blood of kings runs in their veins.</seg>
<seg id="8">Here, we of course are talking primarily about the heroes from a previous level, Led Zeppelin: just like the great foursome, Royal Blood have made it their goal to shake up the stagnant blood of British rock, taking it to new heights.</seg>
<seg id="9">While it’s probably still too early to forecast the success of this enterprise, it’s not too early to make some predictions.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ten songs laid out over thirty-something minutes aren’t so much a demonstration of phenomenal compositional talent, as they are a confident and strong declaration of such intent.</seg>
<seg id="11">It’s impossible to deny the merits of certain tracks: for example, the lead single, “Out Of The Black”, stands out in that one remembers it not for its melodic line, but for its drumming.</seg>
<seg id="12">The musicians jokingly say that this song is easier to tap out a beat to than to sing.</seg>
<seg id="13">It’s also worth singling out the equally powerful “Little Monster” and the record’s closing composition, “Better Strangers”, with a Shakespearean reference in its title.</seg>
<seg id="14">While there is truth to the notion that each of these songs would sound great at a party for hard rock fans, when playing them back to back they begin to merge into a more or less uniform canvas.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is not necessarily a bad thing, but rather quite the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="16">Royal Blood’s strength is that they aren’t trying to become the next Lennon or McCartney (they’d be more likely labelled as Motörhead’s successors), but they have brought many rock duos out of the indie club ghettos.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their music, in spite of some variety, is made for stadiums, whereas, in places that are meant for less than a couple thousand of people, it feels noticeably cramped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The secret, in part, is in the clever use of bass, which supplants the traditional place of the guitar – a technique that was pioneered by The White Stripes at the start of the 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="19">Admittedly, it’s not only about the instruments, but also in the very approach to the composition of the songs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Members of the retro rock movement in the 2000s, with great difficulty, pushed themselves beyond the postmodernist paradigm, and, with great reluctance, moved to call themselves not just imitators, but independent creative entities.</seg>
<seg id="21">Royal Blood already sounds so brazen and powerful that such drive helps to successfully cover-up some of the repetitiveness and bullheadedness of the musical material.</seg>
<seg id="22">After all, who said that rock had to be intelligent?</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion</seg>
<seg id="2">AMAZON just confirmed what the Information reported Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a hundred other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was widely expected to be the buyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago the sale of Twitch to Google's video service, for a cool billion, looked all wrapped up, and the pairing seemed natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, set out to be a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to broadcast their in-game feats; a "YouTube for live gaming," in Business Insider's words.</seg>
<seg id="7">Twitch's interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And "let's play," a genre of videos in which wiseacres give (mostly older) games the Mystery Science Theater treatment, are already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">The point is, YouTube comes up a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube was acquiring Twitch was greeted with a yawn, a textbook example of an entrenched tech company buying out a potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube fell through, considering it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All we have at the moment is this statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery, frankly, is Twitch's incredible success.</seg>
<seg id="13">To snobs like me who declare that they'd rather play sports than watch them, it's hard to see the appeal of watching games rather than taking up a controller myself.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's one thing to look over your friend's shoulder at 3 in the morning as she creeps through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch some rando get 20 headshots in a row in Call of Duty.</seg>
<seg id="15">All the games you could be watching right now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are first-person, so watching footage of them, without controlling the viewpoint yourself, can be a Do It Right-worthy recipe for a headache.</seg>
<seg id="17">I concede that speedruns, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time, are entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But unless someone is a virtuoso at gaming or humour, his Twitch channel isn't likely to be all that interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what do sceptics like me know?</seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch has 55 million unique visitors monthly and is the fourth-largest source of peak internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">How, exactly, will Amazon capitalise on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It's hard to imagine Twitch being folded into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have just swallowed Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Twitch has something any company would love to attract: hordes of advertiser-coveted young men.</seg>
<seg id="24">As Twitch chief Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "are both believers in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no sign of shrinking, even - gulp - as a spectator sport.</seg>

<seg id="1">Deputies have proposed accelerating the entry into force of the law on personal data</seg>
<seg id="2">In the event of the initiative’s success, the storage of personal data of Russian citizens on servers outside of the country will not be permitted from January 1, 2015 on</seg>
<seg id="3">A bill, which seeks to change the date of the entry into force of the already approved law on the personal data of Russian citizens from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015, has been introduced in the State Duma.</seg>
<seg id="4">The initiative is on the legislative docket of the lower chamber.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its authors are State Duma deputies Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parakhin (A Just Russia) and Aleksandr Yushchenko (CPRF).</seg>
<seg id="6">This change, according to the authors of the initiative, will support a more timely and effective enforcement of the rights of Russian citizens as concerns the storage of personal data and the confidentiality of private correspondence on information and telecommunication networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">The law, whose entry into force parliamentarians are trying to hasten, requires that the personal data of Russian citizens created on-line be stored within the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="8">It also requires that the recording, categorization, accumulation, storage, updating, and retrieval of personal data of Russian citizens be on databases that are located within the territory of the Russian Federation, and that information about the location of such databases be provided.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, the law grants Roskomnadzor with the power, based on a court ruling, to restrict access to information gathered in contravention to Russian law in the area of personal data.</seg>
<seg id="10">The law also proposes the creation of so-called “black lists” of sites violating the automated information system: “List of violators of the rights of the subjects of personal data”.</seg>
<seg id="11">The State Duma passed this law in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Andrei Lugovoi and Vadim Dengin from LDPR and Aleksandr Yushchenko from CPRF were the authors of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="13">Dengin and Yushchenko are also two of the authors of the current bill that aims to push forward the date of the entry into force of the already passed law.</seg>
<seg id="14">Those who do not have data centres within Russia will have to lease them</seg>
<seg id="15">Commenting on the bill introduced in the State Duma today, Deputy Head of the Duma Committee for Information Policy, Leonid Levin, stated that he sees no problem with changing the date of the entry into force of the law on the storage of personal data.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to him, those companies that won’t have their own facilities for the storage of personal data of Russian citizens within the Russian Federation by January 1, 2015, will be able to lease them, for example, “from Rostelekom, who have many times said that they are prepared to offer their servers for lease and who have already made their servers available, or from Mail Group, or from Western companies who currently are already making their servers available”.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Additionally, there are several independent data centres that are willing to cooperate in this area”, he added.</seg>
<seg id="18">“If companies decide to abide by the law and continue to work within the Russian Federation, then I don't see any problem with it – they will receive the technical capabilities they require to function”, Levin summed up.</seg>
<seg id="19">A controversial bill</seg>
<seg id="20">Immediately following the publication of the bill, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications warned that if the bill were to pass, Russian citizens wouldn’t be able to use many global internet services anymore.</seg>
<seg id="21">In part, this refers to online booking services for airline tickets and hotels.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to the Association, “the bill denies subjects of personal data – citizens of the Russian Federation – control over their own personal information, by mandatorily determining that the recording, categorization, and so forth of this information should only take place in databases that are located within the Russian Federation”.</seg>
<seg id="23">In its announcement, the RAEC emphasizes that a more effective measure would have been to create a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording, categorization, and so forth of his or her personal information is being carried out.</seg>
<seg id="24">In this way, a person could choose for himself or herself where the operation in question will be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="25">The passing of similar bills on the “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the departure of global service providers and economic losses.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Army of Novorossiya confirms that they have shot down a Ukrainian Su-27, and fault the enemy for violating the ceasefire agreement</seg>
<seg id="3">At 10:00 on September 1, the rebels transferred 402 captives to the Ukrainian side, 72 of which were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead service personnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was reported to Interfax by a representative of the press service for the Army of Novorossiya.</seg>
<seg id="5">He added that: “A Su-27, which was in violation of the ceasefire agreement, was shot down near Mereshka by air defence forces”.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to an agency informant, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions, which are banned under international conventions, during the bombardment of Luhansk airport.</seg>
<seg id="7">The press service representative noted that, during the night, the rebels had managed to damage two Ukrainian Air Force helicopters on one of the airstrips, as well as destroy two armoured vehicles and two weapons caches.</seg>
<seg id="8">“Enemy causalities amounted to as much as one hundred killed and wounded, while 13 surrendered as prisoners”, a representative from staff headquarters briefed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Interfax cannot confirm this information with Ukrainian sources.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Sunday, armed groups of the “peoples’ republics” of Donbass announced the transfer of 223 captured service personnel and soldiers of the Ukrainian National Guard to the Ukrainian side in accordance with the ceasefire framework.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time that night, according to information from the Army of Novorossiya, the army of the DPR “thwarted an attempt by members of the National Guard, in violation of previously reached agreements, to remove heavy equipment from the encircled area”.</seg>
<seg id="12">Next, the rebels reported the destruction of two tanks and two infantry combat vehicles, the capture of six tanks, and the disarming of 198 service personnel in a hit-and-run battle.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to information from staff headquarters, overall enemy losses on that night on all fronts (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) totalled five tanks, eight armed vehicles, and more than 120 killed and injured</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of last week, the rebels encircled a large group of Ukrainian service personnel nearby Ilovaisk in Donetsk Oblast.</seg>
<seg id="15">The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, asked the leadership of the “people’s republics” to let the service personnel out of the encirclement.</seg>
<seg id="16">The DPR agreed to this concession on the condition that the enemy surrender their weapons and ammunition.</seg>
<seg id="17">The first several dozen service personnel started to drop-off their weapons at communities on Saturday morning.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the commander who was encircled by a battalion of the Donbass Ukrainian Territorial Defence, Semyon Semyonchenko, another 14 people escaped from the “entrapment” on Sunday night.</seg>
<seg id="19">Semyonchenko wrote on his Facebook page that the injured Ukrainians “are being held captive by the 137th regiment of the 32nd division and the 9th tank brigade of the Russian Federation”, where they are being treated well.</seg>
<seg id="20">That being said, Russia’s MFA and Ministry of Defence deny statements made by Ukrainian soldiers and NATO about the presence of Russian detachments in Ukraine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian MFA: Russia will take countermeasures in the event of the introduction of new sanctions by the EU</seg>
<seg id="2">Russia reserves the right to enact countermeasures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, reports the Russian MFA.</seg>
<seg id="3">A statement by the Russian diplomatic agency says that the “findings” of the European Council, made on August 30, demonstrate the inability of EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support of the Kievan authorities.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brussels continues to insist that Russia is implicated in the situation in Eastern Ukraine, based on “absolutely unevidenced allegations about the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of that country”, the agency’s website states.</seg>
<seg id="5">Russia’s MFA expresses regret that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, has come under the influence of countries that seek to escalate confrontation with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6">Members of the European Council ought to call for the peaceful resolution of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, as well as provide support for meaningful “dialogue between the opposing parties”, the agency emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Furthermore, it is noted on the agency’s website that, currently, there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-blown humanitarian crisis has broken out, coupled with a growing number of causalities within the civilian population.</seg>
<seg id="8">To recap, over the course of the coming week, the European Union plans to develop a concrete proposal on sanctions against the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, EU representatives are closely cooperating with American officials.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is expected that they will work together to coordinate the established measures in terms of their duration and degree of severity.</seg>
<seg id="11">New sanctions by the European Union might affect the energy and financial sectors.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, the Australian government announced the broadening of its sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance, and the oil and gas industries.</seg>

<seg id="1">Smart ways to save on college textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">With the cost of college textbooks surpassing $1,000 a year for many students, soon-to-be sophomore Matt Schroeder came up with a smart way to trim costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He worked out a system of borrowing books from upperclassmen, offering nominal compensation to get them to delay selling them back.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My calculus book that usually costs $180, I got for the semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A biscuit," says Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Required texts for his last semester would have cost $430, he says.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">The College Board says the average student will spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have a variety of options for managing these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Online outlets and creative approaches like Schroeder's are increasingly the go-to choices for students.</seg>
<seg id="9">Renting textbooks is on the rise, allowing students to use a book for the semester, often at a significant discount to buying.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 campus bookstores, says textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry research shows that about one-fourth of books at college bookstores in this past spring semester were rented, says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fewer than half of all texts are purchased at campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores trade association.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the 101 on the best ways to score a deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buying online</seg>
<seg id="15">Some new book prices can be one-third of what you might find at the campus bookstore if you go online.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler carries a list price of nearly $290 but can be purchased new for $239.99 at specialty textbook retailer Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying used</seg>
<seg id="18">If you do not mind other people's notes or wear and tear, used texts are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Calculus" is selling for $93.49 used on Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he had paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book was selling for $48 new.</seg>
<seg id="22">Academics like Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's College Without Walls, suggest students check with their professors to see if previous editions are acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the classwork.</seg>
<seg id="24">If so, old editions can often be found for a tiny fraction of the cost of the latest version.</seg>
<seg id="25">Besides Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for used books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Renting</seg>
<seg id="27">Renting your textbooks is worth considering if you take reasonable care of them, you remember to return them and you do not care to own them after you complete the class.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80 per cent of the cost of buying a book new.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the length of the semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Know the rules of the store you rent from, including any penalties you could be assessed for taking notes, highlighting, or wear and tear.</seg>
<seg id="31">Renter, beware: If you fail to return the book, penalties can actually exceed the cost of buying it new.</seg>
<seg id="32">E-books</seg>
<seg id="33">Getting e-books instead of traditional texts is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes those books are essentially rented by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc .</seg>
<seg id="35">Chegg will rent "Calculus" for six months for about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Bracey says students in literature classes can often find the best bargains since many classics are now available to download for free, while science and engineering texts can be extremely expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">No matter what, shop around.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Gault, 29, who is about to enter Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to price books since it ensures you are shopping for the right text.</seg>
<seg id="39">Before ordering online, Gault says, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">He learned that lesson the hard way.</seg>
<seg id="41">A book he purchased was back-ordered for four weeks, and he ended up paying full price at the college bookstore.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin made a statement about the total ineffectiveness of the development fund for the Russian Far East</seg>
<seg id="2">The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at a meeting concerning state support for priority investment projects and development areas in the Far East, asserted that the budgetary investment fund for development of the Far East, which was created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.</seg>
<seg id="3">“The 15 billion roubles are still sitting in the deposit account”, the President emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the course of the meeting, the head of state ordered that approval of the list of priority development areas in the Far East be expedited.</seg>
<seg id="5">He pointed out that the bill, which is necessary for the creation of priority development areas, must be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Federal Assembly, the President noted, had still not approved the list of priority development areas in the Far East and their criteria by July 1st.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vladimir Putin also laid out the primary objectives to ensure development of the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="8">They include improving transport accessibility in the region, and removing infrastructure constraints, both in the domestic market and to develop exports.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among other matters, it is essential to create the preconditions to attract additional investment into the region, as well as to form priority development areas, which should become competitive vis-à-vis major business centres in the Asia-Pacific region, the President emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="10">To recap, it was reported earlier that the priority development area might replace the SEZ.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the box office</seg>
<seg id="2">Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 3 has made back less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while Sin City: A Dame to Kill For has made back only $12 million of its $70 million budget.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Cameron Diaz vehicle Sex Tape took only $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films such as How To Train Your Dragon 2 are also showing disappointing box office returns.</seg>
<seg id="4">An article from Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that, when it comes to children's movies, the poor quality of the films themselves might be to blame.</seg>
<seg id="5">Collin called 2014 the "the worst" year yet for children's films, and described How To Train Your Dragon 2 as a merely "functional" fantasy sequel.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when it comes to film pitched at a slightly older market, it appears that the issue might not necessarily lie with the quality of the films themselves.</seg>
<seg id="7">In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for every summer release playing on at least 2,000 screens between May's Memorial Day holiday and July 20, for 2013 and for this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">The results, which take the opinion of both cinema audiences and film critics into account, suggest that this year's crop of films are of similar calibre last year's hits.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some commentators have suggested that changing viewing habits and the increased popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix may be to blame.</seg>
<seg id="10">Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's forthcoming Jungle Book film, told the website Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."</seg>
<seg id="11">We have to acknowledge that and not try to chase what used to be.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast to Hollywood's current box office slump, Netflix recently saw revenue from its streaming content service reach $1.2bn, almost doubling last year's figure of $837m.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and predicted a Hollywood "meltdown."</seg>
<seg id="14">In light of the current downturn, some commentators are arguing that his dire prophecy may have held some truth to it.</seg>
<seg id="15">With summer 2015 set to usher in a slate of potential big box office hits, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other figures within the film industry are feeling more optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="16">X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the drop in box office takings as simply "cyclical," telling Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest box-office summer in history, and nobody will be worrying about the business."</seg>

<seg id="1">The food sanctions aren’t frightening owners of Caucasian and Central Asian establishments, but for European and Japanese restaurants, Russian suppliers are a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2">In general, the food service industry still prefers to substitute banned imports not with goods from Russia, but rather from Latin America, Israel, and China.</seg>
<seg id="3">“It’s better to eat lightly-pickled cucumbers, than bad mozzarella”, laments Mariano Valerio, Executive Chef at Barlotti Italian restaurant, in regards to the quality of cheeses his suppliers are offering him in lieu of Italian ones.</seg>
<seg id="4">The mozzarella and burrata cheese ran-out at the restaurant first – they have a short shelf life.</seg>
<seg id="5">The stockpiles of parmesan should last for another couple of months.</seg>
<seg id="6">What to do?</seg>
<seg id="7">Switch to Russian products?</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2005, I went to Dorogomilosky market.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mariano Valerio makes such a face, that it is clear: the shocking memories have never left him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Meat was sitting out on carts just 30 centimetres from the floor!</seg>
<seg id="11">There were cats there!</seg>
<seg id="12">Rats!</seg>
<seg id="13">That’s when I said that we would never buy anything for our restaurant from Russian markets.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don’t know, maybe things have totally changed there.</seg>
<seg id="15">But this week, I was sent some fish on appro from the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it turned out to be rotten!</seg>
<seg id="17">I said that I didn’t even want to speak with the person who sent it to us.</seg>
<seg id="18">Valerio is surprised that many things that are common in Italy are a rarity for the Russian producer.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several years ago, I was in a position where I needed to buy Russian beef.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Italy, meat is hung in a cold room for 10 days at a temperature of 1 to 2 °C.</seg>
<seg id="21">It needs to hang there to become tender, so that the muscles relax.</seg>
<seg id="22">I did all this with the local meat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then, they would ask me: where did you get such tender meat?</seg>
<seg id="24">I would say: it’s actually your Russian meat!</seg>
<seg id="25">Why doesn’t anyone do this here?</seg>
<seg id="26">A five-minute walk from Barlotti, in the kitchen of the French restaurant, Brasserie Most, hangs a stop list that shows which items are out-of-stock: French oysters, sea urchin.</seg>
<seg id="27">Executive Chef at Brasserie Most restaurant and Strelka bar, Triguel Regis, isn’t as pessimistic as Valerio: they’ve already replaced oysters from France with oysters from Turkey, and in place of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss ones.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, Regis gets more emotional when the conversation turns to Russian suppliers: “200 roubles for cauliflower!</seg>
<seg id="29">I ask: "Why? On what grounds should it cost that much?"</seg>
<seg id="30">They answer me: "We need to make a living too".</seg>
<seg id="31">But that cauliflower shouldn’t cost more than 80 roubles!</seg>
<seg id="32">We buy oysters from the Far East by weight, and they live for 15-20 years, but can you imagine how much their shells weigh?</seg>
<seg id="33">At that price, they really are a super delicacy.</seg>
<seg id="34">It appears that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of horror for foreign chefs.</seg>
<seg id="35">A typical story: “Everything was fine for the first three months and then the quality dramatically declined”.</seg>
<seg id="36">The main complaints: Russian suppliers can’t sustain consistent quantities and quality.</seg>

<seg id="39">A sanctions menu</seg>
<seg id="40">On August 6, Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which principally refer to food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The import of beef, pork, poultry meat and by-products, deli meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheeses, vegetables, fruit, nuts, kielbasa, and sugar syrups into the country is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="42">A game of leapfrog has begun between restaurants and suppliers: prices for food products have risen, and they must urgently look for comparable products from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">This has most significantly affected expensive restaurants that exclusively serve French, Italian, and Spanish cuisine, and import their goods directly from their “home” countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">The food service industry has had to make alternative arrangements in the past.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, at the beginning of 2014, Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and, the year before that, American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">Instead, suppliers established supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay, and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But the sanctions of the summer of 2014 have turned out to be a lot more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which removes baby Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, planting potatoes, sweet corn, peas, and onions for planting from the ban.</seg>
<seg id="49">Valerio the Italian hopes that the sanctions will be relaxed even further.</seg>
<seg id="50">In the meantime, part of the restaurant industry waits in a state of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="51">According to data from the company, Vostok-Zapad, one of the largest suppliers of the HORECA sector, the share of imported products in the premium segment of the market amounted to as much as 70%.</seg>
<seg id="52">“Expensive restaurants will have to change their menus to fit with what local farmers and other countries are producing, says Sergei Mironov, restaurateur and owner of Reskonsalt agency.</seg>
<seg id="53">If the head chef is talented, then it shouldn’t be a problem for them.</seg>
<seg id="54">But, we only have very few chefs like this, and the preparation of a new menu could take two or three months.</seg>
<seg id="55">Triguel from the restaurant, Brasserie Most, is ready for this: he will have to abandon 10-15% of his dishes, and still rework half of the menu.</seg>
<seg id="56">Restaurants that offer fusion cuisine are already starting to substitute their dishes, for example, beef stroganoff in place of a marbled beefsteak, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">“Cheeses from Europe can be substituted with Russian and Belarusian cheeses, and cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, and Chile, lists Oksana Glibchuk, a representative from the company Vostok-Zapad.</seg>
<seg id="58">Cream and dairy products from Europe have equivalents in Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chicken from the USA can be substituted with chicken from Russia and Belarus, and salmon and summer salmon from Norway – with salmon, summer salmon, and trout from Belarus and Chile.</seg>
<seg id="60">The absence of European-produced vegetables and fruits can be offset by domestically produced goods, and by offers from Serbia, Moldova, and China.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to Mironov, it will be easier for lower-end restaurant chains to adjust than for the premium sector: it’s doubtful that they are frequented by food connoisseurs who are capable of telling the difference between an Italian mozzarella and a Russian one.</seg>
<seg id="62">Although, it will be difficult for Ginza Project establishments, he considers.</seg>
<seg id="63">The Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.</seg>
<seg id="64">Changing this will take an enormous amount of time”, Mironov says.</seg>
<seg id="65">Ginza declined to comment, citing the owners’ absence from the country.</seg>
<seg id="66">Owners of cafés that offer Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that food products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European ones</seg>
<seg id="67">But there are many restaurants that are barely affected by the sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="68">This includes establishments with cuisine from CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian, and Azerbaijani.</seg>
<seg id="69">“There aren’t any expensive ingredients in Georgian cooking, says Khatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant, Saperavi, and the café, Vai Me!.</seg>
<seg id="70">All of our cheeses are produced in Russia, chicken fillet is the base for many of our dishes, and we don’t use exotic greens”.</seg>
<seg id="71">As of yet, none of Kolbaya’s establishments have removed a single dish from their menus.</seg>
<seg id="72">The sanctions are also no bother to Timur Lansky, the owner of Chaikhona N1, which serves Uzbek cuisine: he will only have to switch to lamb from New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="73">If Russia can establish imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, we'll be even better off, as it will be even cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">It’s possible to get cheaper fillet steak, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, and fruit from the CIS.</seg>
<seg id="75">Moreover, goods imported from Central Asia are much better than the "plastic" from Italy, Spain, and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="76">Everyone knows that Uzbek tomatoes are delicious and sweet.</seg>
<seg id="77">Nobody says that about Spanish ones.</seg>
<seg id="78">Following the introduction of sanctions, a representative from Uzbekistan’s Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources, Olimboy Artykov, announced plans to double exports of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by 2016.</seg>
<seg id="79">Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports to Russia almost immediately after the introduction of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="80">The fast food restaurants that responded to Kommersant-Dengi’s survey were also fairly calm about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="81">McDonald’s press service announced that their localization exceeds 85% and that the chain works with 160 Russian suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="82">According to Tatiana Bogdanova, Head of the Supply Management Department for Subway Russia, the chain buys around 80% of its food supplies in Russia, although temporary difficulties, associated with the supply of vegetables and increasing prices for meat products that are produced using imported materials, may arise.</seg>
<seg id="83">At Teremok, “sanctioned goods” generally accounted for no more than 4%.</seg>
<seg id="84">The sanctions also haven’t affected Wokker noodle house.</seg>
<seg id="85">KFC, Burger King, and Kroshka Kartoshka didn’t respond to Kommersant-Dengi’s survey, however, other market participants confirm that Burger King’s level of localization is significantly lower than McDonald’s.</seg>
<seg id="86">In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are more likely to buy Chilean fish than those from Russia’s Far East</seg>
<seg id="87">B(u)y one’s own pink salmon</seg>
<seg id="88">In the meantime, restaurateurs are complaining that, as a result of increasing demand, prices are rising even on local goods.</seg>
<seg id="89">“The prices of goods for Grabli have gone up by an average of 10-15%, and for the Italian restaurant, Cherry Mio, they have doubled”, says restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovsky.</seg>
<seg id="90">Even in Georgian restaurants, the prime cost of dishes will increase by 5-10%, Kolbaya acknowledges.</seg>
<seg id="91">Vostok-Zapad doesn’t disagree: “For example, Belarusian dairy products have increased in price by 10-15% since the beginning of August”.</seg>
<seg id="92">“Brazilian suppliers increased prices on pork by almost twofold, complains Sergei Rak, Assistant General Manager of Stardogs.</seg>
<seg id="93">Chicken legs have gone up in price by 35%.</seg>
<seg id="94">We are waiting for the prices from China; perhaps they will cool down the Brazilian hotheads.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the near future, Stardogs will go ahead with a planned 8% increase in its prices.</seg>
<seg id="96">Right now is not a very desirable time to raise prices, Rak says.</seg>
<seg id="97">According to the statistics, revenue growth in the food service industry was only 1.8% for the second quarter of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="98">This is the lowest figure since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="99">Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how quickly: the majority of restaurateurs have already stocked-up on goods for the next two months, in hopes of riding out the fluctuations in purchasing prices.</seg>
<seg id="100">But nobody knows what things will be like two months from now.</seg>
<seg id="101">On the square in front of Moscow city hall, there are dozens of tents decorated by greenery and trees.</seg>
<seg id="102">In the centre, there is a stage where musicians are playing a waltz.</seg>
<seg id="103">It’s a festival of regional food with the fun name “It’s time to eat”.</seg>
<seg id="104">“Actually, we’ve been planning on having a celebration of local food for quite some time, and now, with the sanctions, we rushed to put the festival together”, says one of the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="105">On the side of the stage with the musicians, the Greek chef, Anastas, prepares a salad from macaroni and homemade sweets; during the week there was a workshop on how to prepare borsch with caramelized apples.</seg>
<seg id="106">Everything is made from Russian goods, the organizers attest.</seg>
<seg id="107">In the tents, there is an exhibition on the achievements of the Russian national economy.</seg>
<seg id="108">Honey from Bashkiria, reindeer from Salekhard, vegetables from the Lenin State Farm outside of Moscow, cheeses by the Russified Italian, Jay Klouz.</seg>
<seg id="109">“Salmon for restaurants can easily be substituted with a different fish from the salmon family from the Far East, says the owner of the fish stall, Our People, Filipp Galkin.</seg>
<seg id="110">We catch all sorts of salmon: Sockeye, Chum, Coho, Pink, and Chinook – the "king of salmon".</seg>
<seg id="111">Sure, they’re not as fatty as Norwegian salmon, because they are wild fish.</seg>
<seg id="112">Norwegian salmon are actually an aquaculture product.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can grab it with your hands and it won’t even wriggle.</seg>
<seg id="114">But you wouldn’t be able to hold our salmon from the Far East in your hands.</seg>
<seg id="115">Only an establishment without any particular pretensions would be willing to substitute Italian mozzarella with a domestic one</seg>
<seg id="116">In the display case in his tent, there are shrimp with a tag reading “Magadan”, cod, omul, muksun, and mussels from Crimea, and scallops from the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="117">Galkin is sure that it’s high time to switch to fish from the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="118">According to statistics, the annual fish catch in Russia for 2013 was more than 4 mln. tonnes, with a significant portion of the fish caught being sent to Japan, Korea, and even the USA.</seg>
<seg id="119">Fish imports for 2013 totalled around 800 thou. tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="120">The Our People stall has been operating since 2012, selling fish through its on-line store, and was already supplying a dozen and a half restaurants, including Simple Things, before the introduction of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="121">Now, Galkin has received requests from another 15 restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="122">You can make the very same sushi from our fish, he says excitedly.</seg>
<seg id="123">We racked our brains and tried out various recipes.</seg>
<seg id="124">Now we sell a million roubles worth of sushi per month through our on-line store.</seg>
<seg id="125">Our fish is several times less expensive and the delivery charge is no more than 15 roubles per kilogram.</seg>
<seg id="126">To vouch for his wares, Galkin prepares a Philadelphia roll with chum salmon for me to sample at his stall.</seg>
<seg id="127">In contrast to rolls made with Atlantic salmon, these ones take longer to chew, but the knowledge that this is our fish, our own domestic fish, gives one the strength to do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">On Our People’s on-line store there are even rolls made with halibut and ocean perch.</seg>
<seg id="129">Sushi bars, however, prefer to substitute Norwegian salmon with the Chilean variety.</seg>
<seg id="130">Galkin chalks this up to chefs who are too lazy to come up with new recipes using fish from the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="131">“So far, our suppliers haven’t offered us Russian fish”, Dmitry Evseev, the owner of Killfish Bar, offers his explanation.</seg>
<seg id="132">It’s a similar situation with other food products: Russian producers could very well fill these now vacant niches, but it isn’t happening.</seg>
<seg id="133">According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project, Boris Akimov, right now, one can talk more about the substitution of imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="134">There, they have large transnational corporations with strong logistics networks and large volumes.</seg>
<seg id="135">Unlike our farmers, they are capable of quickly providing substitutes for banned imports.</seg>
<seg id="136">That is to say, large producers from other countries will be the biggest winners of the import ban”, says Akimov.</seg>
<seg id="137">However, last month the restaurant industry received a warning signal even bigger than the food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="138">Following the results of widespread random inspections by Rospotrebnadzor, three McDonald’s establishments in Moscow and two of its regional establishments in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily closed.</seg>

<seg id="140">The truth is that no one understands what will happen next.</seg>
<seg id="141">If all of this is limited to just food sanctions, then this is an option we can live through, an employee from a company involved in restaurant consulting said, on the condition of anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="142">But if they start to close down all the McDonald’s throughout the country, then this will be an entirely different case.</seg>

<seg id="1">A “europrotocol” instead of a certificate from the STSI</seg>
<seg id="2">It will be possible to receive payouts from fully comprehensive vehicle insurance policies without a certificate from the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate – the Central Bank is determined to stimulate the implementation of European Accident Reports or “europrotocols” in Russia by such means.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bank of Russia has developed a draft directive according to which, starting from September 1 of this year, an insured driver would be able to receive a payout from a fully comprehensive vehicle insurance policy without a certificate from the STSI.</seg>
<seg id="4">Truth be told, this issue only concerns those situations where an accident is processed using a “europrotocol” without the involvement of the road police.</seg>
<seg id="5">In other words, only in cases where two vehicles are involved in a motor vehicle accident, there are no injured individuals, the damage does not exceed a set limit, and both drivers have reached a consensus as to who is at fault in the accident.</seg>
<seg id="6">From August 2 on, the payout limit for accidents processed using a “europrotocol” amounts to 50 thou. roubles; whereas, on October 1, the limit will be raised to 400 thou. roubles in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, as well as in both Moscow and Leningrad Oblasts.</seg>
<seg id="7">The issue is that, more often than not, even in a situation where there is only minor damage and the motor vehicle accident could be processed using a “europrotocol”, the drivers who have gotten into the accident still call the STSI.</seg>
<seg id="8">After all, it wasn’t possible to receive repayment from a fully comprehensive vehicle insurance policy without a certificate from the STSI.</seg>
<seg id="9">The parameters prescribed in the draft directive specifically call for the removal of this barrier on the road to the implementation of the “europrotocol” in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">In accordance with them, the maximum payout on a fully comprehensive vehicle insurance policy for a motor vehicle accident that is processed without STSI officers, should not be lower than the limit for an accident processed using a “europrotocol”.</seg>
<seg id="11">But, at the same time, it cannot be higher than the limit set out in the contract of the fully comprehensive vehicle insurance policy.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea is, without a doubt, useful and, in theory, could free up both STSI officers and the roads.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, it’s not likely to be met with delight from either drivers or insurers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The latter are already talking about the serious threat of an increase in fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules on payouts for fully comprehensive vehicle insurance policies.</seg>
<seg id="15">As far as drivers are concerned, it’s hard to imagine exactly what kind of work would have to be done to overcome our long-standing Russian conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driver, in the majority of cases, will wait hours for an officer to process a minor accident, just because it is more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="17">It’s still not clear what will be easier: defeating the fraudsters or convincing drivers of the reliability of the “europrotocol”.</seg>
<seg id="18">The savings certificate will be made registered and irrevocable</seg>
<seg id="19">The Ministry of Finance wants to ban bearer savings certificates, but allow banks to offer an irrevocable deposit as a substitute.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Ministry of Finance is preparing a draft bill, which would ban bearer savings certificates.</seg>
<seg id="21">Lately, this instrument has gained popularity, since the rates are higher than those paid on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The issue is that bearer savings certificates are not covered by the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for a bank to offer since it doesn’t have to contribute funds to the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).</seg>
<seg id="23">The poignancy of the situation is that plans to take this step were made as a result of small and medium-size banks distributing these certificates, but it is Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which according to DIA estimates control 98% of the niche market, that will suffer as a result.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreover, Bank of Moscow’s share, according to the agency’s estimates, amounts to around 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The issue, the DIA explains, is that clients of a small bank who have purchased this certificate might try to get money from the DIA in a case where the bank’s license is revoked.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some investors don’t have a sufficient level of financial understanding and, when purchasing bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">The legitimate absence of insurance compensation for such certificates, in a case where a bank’s licence is revoked, might lead to misunderstanding and social unrest.</seg>
<seg id="28">The agency has dealt with actual situations where the holders of bearer certificates have attempted to collect insurance compensation through the courts”, the DIA stated.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, is far-fetched.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, no one will ever pay the buyers of such certificates since they don’t have any rights under the law to seek compensation from the state.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the issue was that the instrument isn’t insured by the DIA, then they also would have banned metal accounts, in which citizens’ wealth is recorded according to grams of one of four metals: gold, silver, platinum, and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">After all, these accounts also are not covered by the deposit insurance system, but so far no one is trying to snuff them out.</seg>
<seg id="33">Most likely, the issue is that these bearer certificates are a very convenient valuable security, which can basically be used as quasi-money.</seg>
<seg id="34">Moreover, their movement is almost uncontrollable: any client of a bank can buy the certificate and hand it over to any other citizen, and, until it is converted into cash, this certificate can change hands between a multitude of owners.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is no accident that the wording of the draft bill requires that a savings certificate be a registered security that is held at a depository institution.</seg>
<seg id="36">But, in order to sweeten the deal for the banks, these certificates can be issued without the right to early redemption.</seg>
<seg id="37">In other words, bankers will finally get an equivalent to the irrevocable deposit that they have long been dreaming about.</seg>

<seg id="1">Two unions meet</seg>
<seg id="2">High-level negotiations in Minsk have failed to solve the issues for which they were convened, but they have created a new format: dignitaries from the European Union met with dignitaries from the soon-to-be Eurasian Union</seg>
<seg id="3">Albeit, given the alarming matters (the situation surrounding Ukraine won’t tolerate delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union first discussed a series of “hot topics”.</seg>
<seg id="4">It isn’t clear if a structure like this is capable of working effectively; however, it is obvious who’s skimmed the cream off the top of this summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Any question about this was put to rest on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, and after them other Eurasians, saw a new President Lukashenko on the television news broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader was a model of polished gallantry, giving off the manner of a person who has just hit the jackpot and is planning to spend their old age in the lap of luxury.</seg>
<seg id="7">How Maidan helped Lukashenko</seg>
<seg id="8">The simultaneous arrival in Minsk of three major European commissioners (EU ministers), who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to present the final briefing on their behalf, was not only a legitimization of the President with 20 years of service.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was a declaration of the acknowledgment of Minsk as a full-fledged member of European politics and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">Senior Analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Denis Melyantsov, is certain that, from now on, Brussels won’t be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The fact that Catherine Ashton met face-to-face with Lukashenko gives one a basis to assume that relations with the EU will continue to thaw”, he told Ogonyok.</seg>
<seg id="12">This iceberg has a hidden part: Belarusian authorities had been preparing for this breakthrough since the summer of 2013, long before the start of the November Maidan movement in Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="13">“Results with the EU had already been achieved: successful negotiations on simplifying the visa regime and readmission, dialogues on modernization, lists Ogonyok’s source, and negotiations on international security had been conducted with the USA.</seg>
<seg id="14">The States even loosened their sanctions a little.</seg>
<seg id="15">As far as Ukrainian events are concerned, well they themselves, as well as the Belarusian leadership’s response to them, simply ratcheted up the process.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the one hand, Minsk succeeded in keeping its relations with Ukraine rather warm, so as to not significantly hurt mutual trade, and President Poroshenko was able to come to Belarus for the negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure didn’t recognize Crimea’s unification with Russia and called for the pro-Russian rebels in Donbass to be punished to the fullest extent, hasn’t had a falling out with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk hasn’t withdrawn from the Customs Union or CSTO, and there is a Russian airbase stationed in Baranovichi.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington noticed Minsk’s balanced position on the Ukrainian question and put stock in it, the Belarusian experts are convinced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Just how successful Lukashenko’s move towards political diversification turns out to be, will be seen by how often, in the near future, Minsk has the occasion to host meetings in the EU-CU format.</seg>
<seg id="21">The press service for the EU High Representative for External Affairs and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton, wasn’t able to provide an impromptu response to questions about what Brussels expects from mutual relations in this new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ashton’s Press Secretary, Maya Kosyanchich, only told to Ogonyok that, within the context of solving matters of war and peace, this issue isn’t a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">Furthermore, a statement came out that suggests that the next meeting place for negotiations on the Ukrainian question, with the participation of dignitaries in the new format, could be Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">The fly in the ointment for Minsk turned out to be a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that European Union representatives, it turns out, personally asked him about this.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nevertheless, in the final briefing, Aleksandr Lukashenko made it clear that all sides are not opposed to having Minsk remain as the main forum for meetings in the Russia-OSCE-Ukraine format, as well as for meetings between heads of state and EU high commissioners.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that “Europe’s last dictator” has attained the status of a being a hand-shakeable European leader, who is helping to solve a global issue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Best friend to the European farmer</seg>
<seg id="28">Later the EU delegation itself, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, came to the conclusion that the main rationale for the summit wasn’t in fact the tragic situation in Donbass, but rather the economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">As a matter of fact, the schedule for upcoming negotiations prepared at the meeting, which will deal with the supply of gas and overcoming the misgivings of CU countries regarding Ukraine’s association agreement with the EU, appears to be a much grander achievement than the peaceful declarations lacking concrete dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Commissioner for Trade, Karel De Gucht, nevertheless, indicated that EU representatives “came to Minsk to find a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, and not the other way around”.</seg>
<seg id="31">It appears, however, that, even in terms of economics, the crisis in Ukraine “works” for Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences – first and foremost the reciprocal sanctions between the West and Russia – have provided Minsk, which is still feeling the pressure of sanctions itself, with long-awaited room to manoeuvre.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to Jaroslav Romanchuk, Head of the Mises Scientific Research Centre and former Belarusian presidential candidate, European investors are keenly interested in Belarus’ ability to supply Russia with agricultural products in circumvention of the sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">Moreover, the supply network structures, which Vladimir Putin admonished Minsk for at the summit, are pushing forward.</seg>
<seg id="35">“The initiators of these structures”, Romanchuk stressed to Ogonyok, “are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They spent a long time developing networks to supply goods, including in Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and now, these networks have been destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business critically needs to re-establish them, even if it’s through Belarusian structures acting as intermediaries.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second subject, the expert continues, is connected to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to setting up production in Belarus, using Ukrainian raw materials, which is intended for the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">Ukrainian producers do about 4 bln. dollars in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trading structures could now turn out to be in very high-demand”.</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Romanchuk, the role of forum host to negotiations between the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko, as well as in terms of developing economic relations with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He reminds us that losses to the EU’s agricultural sector, as a result of Moscow’s sanctions, are valued at between 5-10 bln. euros, and that the European Commission has, as of late, only offered agrarians 125 mln. euros in compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian President could offer Brussels the opportunity to work together to minimize the impact on European farmers.</seg>
<seg id="43">This could raise Lukashenko’s profile in the EU to an unprecedented level.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiative</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked Belarusian authorities for their initiative to hold a summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that official Minsk denies its active role in creating the CU+EU format, and the Belarusian leader, at a meeting with his Ukrainian colleague, underscored that Kiev alone was the author of the new format.</seg>
<seg id="47">“It was your suggestion to get together, without all the distractions, to discuss and to make a decision, in a direct manner, following the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to deal with the situation that was developing at that moment in Ukraine”, he said to Petro Poroshenko in front of the cameras.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers have interpreted this as an attempt to appease Moscow, which is rumoured to have initially been against Minsk’s mediation, which has significantly increased its political clout.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Belarusian diplomatic agency assiduously stresses that Belarus does not have ulterior motives in organizing cooperation between the EU and the CU on its soil, given that the final goal of such a format is the creation, in the future, of a unified trading area from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">“This is absolutely in keeping with policies in other fields, including in the field of security, that are advanced and promoted by the leadership of our strategic partner – the Russian Federation”, Ogonyok was told by the MFA of Belarus, an agency, which, as of late, has been choosing its words wisely.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Moscow City Government is considering the option of introducing entry toll zones as a method for combatting congestion on roads in the centre, in a similar way to other major world cities, reports M24.ru, with reference to the Deputy Mayor of Moscow for transportation issues, Maxim Liksutov.</seg>
<seg id="3">One of the options that has proven itself to be effective is an entry toll.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is the expert opinion, which we will certainly examine and we will look at all the positives and the negatives.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Deputy Mayor emphasized that the experiences of Asian cities, which in terms of structure and congestion are very similar to Moscow, were of particular importance to authorities of the capital city.</seg>
<seg id="7">One of the solutions taken from these countries is the construction of a central ring road, which is already being implemented, Liksutov added.</seg>
<seg id="8">The recently launched construction of the Central Ring Road is one example of how it is not necessary for all traffic to pass through Moscow.</seg>

<seg id="1">Boredom is a sin</seg>
<seg id="2">The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For, accomplished a totally different revolution than one might have expected it to.</seg>
<seg id="3">The first Sin City (2005), shot with the minimal, but symbolic, participation of Quentin Tarantino, accomplished a revolution in the relationship between film, comics, and noir fiction.</seg>
<seg id="4">The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys a formula that is fundamental to modern thinking, “thesis – antithesis – synthesis” (if we understand thesis to mean the universe of noir, and antithesis to mean space comics).</seg>
<seg id="5">From now on, it will have to be read as follows: “thesis – antithesis – chaos”.</seg>
<seg id="6">Sin City 2 is chaotic both on a dramatic and philosophical level: it is chaotic in the idiotic sense of the word on both accounts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yes, some of the characters are familiar from the first “City”, although, there’s the hoodlum, Marv (Mickey Rourke), who, if memory serves, ended his life in the electric chair, and now, as if nothing happened, he just manages – in the role of something like a people’s guard – to snatch out of thin air, knives, and all sorts of hatchets, and nooses.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the newcomers simply push the old fellows aside with their elbows, as if they were breaking into the city from some other film, the meaning and story of which the audience is asked not to worry about.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now, there’s the story, shamelessly interrupted by the authors at the most interesting moment, of the extra lucky gambler, Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).</seg>
<seg id="10">There’s the story of the salaciously-frigid Ava Lord (Eva Green) and Dwight (Josh Brolin), who takes revenge on her for some reason.</seg>
<seg id="11">But this confusion, in which, let’s say, Dwight can’t be differentiated by sight from Johnny – moreover since their faces, as with the other body parts of the characters, are demolished with relentless regularity – is not a big deal or even a little bit of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="12">These aren’t real people, of course we understand that these are archetypes of the noir genre: a fatalistic bitch, an overconfident gambler, a detective who falls into a sex “honey trap”, and a corrupt parasitic senator.</seg>
<seg id="13">But when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and gets kicked out by an archetype, then it’s not really a film anymore, but almost like an abstract painting.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it’s simply ridiculous to ask an abstract painting questions about the logic of its subject matter.</seg>
<seg id="15">By the same token, even in this hectic world, there are some things that remain constant.</seg>
<seg id="16">The fighting prostitutes from the first “City” still hold a security perimeter around their native slums, against the besieging forces of darkness.</seg>
<seg id="17">And, while at first, the ghost of Detective Hartigan isn’t anywhere to be seen, he later joins the party, and it’s always nice to look at Bruce Willis.</seg>
<seg id="18">The major problem with Sin City 2 has to do with something else.</seg>
<seg id="19">Frank Miller was great in that, as an illustrator, he skilfully fused comics with noir fiction, and, as a director, in how he reinvented our understanding of how to take comics from the page to the screen.</seg>
<seg id="20">Comics and noir fiction are two diametrically opposed “realities”.</seg>
<seg id="21">The comics phenomenon, in its modern context, was born at the end of the 1920s, when Dashiell Hammett’s novels, Red Harvest (1929), The Maltese Falcon (1930), and The Glass Key (1931), created the noir cannon, which at that time was called the hard-boiled school.</seg>
<seg id="22">Or pulp fiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">Comics have given Hollywood many dozens of characters: from Popeye the Sailor Man – who ate spinach to give himself heroic strength – Superman, Batman, and the gumshoe, Dick Tracy, to the Hulk, Thor, Spiderman, and other such “avengers”.</seg>
<seg id="24">But there was always something lacking in every film based on a comic: the illustrated characters stubbornly refused to come to life on the screen, and continued to be imposters in the like it or not “real” world that surrounded them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Simply put, they were totally devoid of “existence”.</seg>
<seg id="26">Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre in world literature.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the world wars, the traditional novel, with its dilemmas, characters, family scandals, and historical background, lost all persuasiveness.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Forsytes, what Thibaults, or Rougon-Macquarts, or even Bolkonskys or Rostovs are even conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz, or Hiroshima?</seg>
<seg id="29">That type of novel could easily be twisted into a soap opera, but the crime novel – by definition on the margins – rose to the level of philosophical prose.</seg>
<seg id="30">Hammett learned first-hand what it was like to work as an orderly on the front.</seg>
<seg id="31">He was a communist.</seg>
<seg id="32">Incidentally, other pillars of the genre, such as writers, Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, and directors, Jules Dassin, Joseph Losey, and Edward Dmytryk, were also close to the Communist Party, albeit to a lesser extent.</seg>
<seg id="33">This is why noir, and the archetype that they created, is, first of all, crude and cynical, and, secondly, particularly social.</seg>
<seg id="34">It’s almost like an American version of socialist realism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first Sin City was remarkable because it counterintuitively, yet organically, blended comics with noir.</seg>
<seg id="36">It was the very first time comics came to life on the screen, not a bit ashamed of their illustrational nature, and without pretending to be a “real” film.</seg>
<seg id="37">The gloom of the corrupt world, where a cardinal orders a hit, and a senator covers for his monstrous sadistic son, was entirely worthy of Hammett’s pen.</seg>
<seg id="38">While the picturesque details, such as the severed heads that the sadist used to decorate his flat, are as if from the pen of the genius, James Ellroy, author of The Black Dahlia, and the best – that is to say, declaratively stomach-turning – representative of the neo-noir genre.</seg>
<seg id="39">Sin City 2 is not just a retreat, but an utter capitulation of the radical Miller-Rodriguez stylistic addition to the comic tradition.</seg>
<seg id="40">Probably, much of this is the result of 3D technology.</seg>
<seg id="41">When you’re watching the second Sin City, you feel as if you are imprisoned in a glass sphere, inside of which snow covers a toy-sized cesspool.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, more often than not, it’s not snow at all, but bloody scraps, however, in the grand scheme of things, what’s the difference?</seg>
<seg id="43">There is nothing to be said about sociality here.</seg>
<seg id="44">After all, such a thing is only possible when somewhere, in some place, we, at some time or another, have, even if it’s along the margins of a dirty swamp, a normal world that exists, to which a girl, who has been down a crooked path, can return, or, let’s say, where it’s possible to tell her devastated parents that the one who destroyed her has been punished.</seg>
<seg id="45">When there is no room in sin city for anything other than sin, then sin is no longer a sin, but just the norm.</seg>
<seg id="46">It's boring, just like any other norm.</seg>
<seg id="47">The chaos of Sin City 2 is just boring.</seg>
<seg id="48">To be fair, the domestic release added a little extra spice to this unsavoury sin.</seg>
<seg id="49">The on-screen captions warn that the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.</seg>
<seg id="50">In relation to the show, which in its least bloody scene shows a person’s fingers being broken with pliers, this reads as hellish humour.</seg>
<seg id="51">Hammett would have liked it.</seg>

<seg id="5">As a placatory gesture, the prime minister insisted his government would not call into question France's controversial 35-hour working week, despite inflammatory suggestions it should relax the rules earlier in the week by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, Mr Hollande had implored his fellow Socialists to remain "united" with the government.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, put a spanner in the works by turning up to a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs and criticising the Socialist Party for letting the French "lose faith in their future."</seg>
<seg id="8">Marine Le Pen, the far-Right National Front leader, heaped scorn on the Socialists' constant in-fighting by saying she did not see the new Valls government lasting more than just a few months.</seg>
<seg id="9">Francois Hollande the Emperor has no clothes, but neither has Prince Manuel Valls, forced to put together a new government when the previous one didn't even survive the summer.</seg>
<seg id="10">"And the new one won't survive the fall or the winter either," Miss Le Pen told supporters.</seg>
<seg id="11">She reiterated her party's call for a parliamentary dissolution, saying she was confident it could win early elections and stood ready to govern.</seg>
<seg id="12">France's ruling party suffered a drubbing in March municipal elections and the far-right National Front came out on top in EU elections in May.</seg>
<seg id="13">A poll in Sunday's Journal du Dimanche found 76 per cent of French believe the Socialist Party risks breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Mr Hollande's presidential term in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="14">Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po university, warned the French would fast lose patience unless the new Socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It has a small window of opportunity, but public opinion needs to quickly feel things are changing," he warned.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, the situation could further degenerate.</seg>

<seg id="1">“City Without Drugs” is left without a suit</seg>
<seg id="2">The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed without prejudice a lawsuit by the Administrative Directorate of the Regional Ministry for the Administration of State Property against the City Without Drugs Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="3">The agency intended to recover more than 7 mln. roubles by way of payment for the lease of a building in the centre of Yekaterinburg.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the claimant failed to show up to court on two occasions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, the Arbitration Court for Sverdlovsk Oblast dismissed without prejudice a lawsuit by the Administrative Directorate of the Ministry for the Administration of State Property (MUGISO) against the City Without Drugs Foundation (one of whose founders is the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Roizman).</seg>
<seg id="6">Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect 7.3 mln. roubles from the organization as payment for the lease of a building.</seg>
<seg id="7">Today, it came to light that the claimant failed to appear in court twice, which is why the decision was made to deny the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="8">We were unable to clarify the reason for the absence of representatives from the Directorate of the MUGISO, as the Head of the Legal Department, Maksim Titov, wasn’t answering phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were also unable to get in contact with representatives from the Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a reminder, the issue at hand concerns the mansion at 19 Belinsky Street in the centre of the city, where the Foundation has been located on a free-of-charge basis since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">The previous Governor, Aleksandr Misharin, made this decision.</seg>
<seg id="12">In November 2012, the Administrative Directorate of the Ministry for the Administration of State Property for Sverdlovsk Oblast filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court to evict the Foundation from the building.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the lawsuit, the agency sought, via the courts, a declaration that the contract for the free-use of the premises of the historical mansion was void.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the Directorate of the MUGISO, the material terms for the lease of the cultural heritage site were not written in the contract.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the lawsuit and then an appeal was lodged with the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was granted.</seg>
<seg id="16">Then, in the same court, the Foundation filed a cassation appeal against the decision which did not receive approval; this decision then was appealed by the Foundation in the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court sided with the Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="17">In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded, according to which the Foundation started to pay rent; head of the city, Yeveny Roizman, spoke about this.</seg>
<seg id="18">The rental fee was set at 300 thou. roubles a month.</seg>
<seg id="19">The previous regional administration gave us free-use of this building, in recognition of our achievements in the fight against drugs, and as a sign of respect for the Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="20">The current administration decided differently”, he stated.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tatiana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg</seg>
<seg id="22">Why the Mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to voluntarily resign</seg>
<seg id="23">On July 24, United Russia Deputy for the Yekaterinburg City Duma, Aleksandr Kosintsev, suggested that the Mayor and Speaker of the City Duma, Yevgeny Roizman, resign.</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason for this being the criminal case against City Duma Deputy, Oleg Kinev, who was arrested as a suspect in the murder of a female pensioner, and who is deemed a close associate of the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="25">How they found a criminal case against Evgeny Roizman</seg>
<seg id="26">On July 1, it came to light that a criminal case had been initiated in connection with “slander” (Art. 128.1 of the Russian Criminal Code) in the blog of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Roizman.</seg>
<seg id="27">This was reported by the Main Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior for Sverdlovsk Oblast, to whom the General Director of the Protection Centre for Rights, Anna Filatova, appealed with corroborating documents.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her, in his blog entries, of participating in crimes that were allegedly committed by her ex-spouse.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Mayor of Yekaterinburg is confident that “this is yet another attempt to avenge the truth”.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the run-up to September 9, when Apple is set to introduce its new developments, more leaks about what to expect from the presentation have started to appear in the press.</seg>
<seg id="3">With reference to sources, the American media reports that the sixth generation iPhone will be fitted with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project between Apple and Visa, MasterCard, and American Express payment systems.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to information from Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource, Re/code, at the September 9th presentation on new products, among other things, there may be an announcement about the joint project with the Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, which has resulted in the availability of a mobile wallet function on the new iPhone 6 smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The companies themselves refuse to make any comments on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="6">This function will make it possible to complete a transaction at a till using a smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="7">The user will complete authorization of the payment by using his or her fingerprint with the help of the TouchID function.</seg>
<seg id="8">It’s being reported that this iPhone will be the very first with built-in NFC (near field communication) technology, which makes it possible to complete contactless payments using a smartphone and a corresponding reading device at the till.</seg>
<seg id="9">The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company, NXP (previously Philips Semiconductors).</seg>
<seg id="10">The NFC function was featured for the very first time in 2004, within a framework of cooperation between Sony, Nokia, Phillips Semiconductors, and more than a hundred other companies, included in the so-called NFC Forum – an association for the further development of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nokia released the first phone with NFC in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="12">The first Android smartphone with an NFC function was the Samsung Nexus S, introduced in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="13">In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which enables users to link bankcards to their Google profile and make payments using an Android smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, American experts emphasize that, in spite of the massive investments made by high-tech companies into NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about the innovation and are not all that excited about spending money to equip their stores with these systems.</seg>
<seg id="15">As such, observers are now hoping that Apple’s entry into this market will force retailers to hurry up and quickly introduce this technology into their retail stores.</seg>

<seg id="3">A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships and affluent clientele as it competes with bigger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).</seg>
<seg id="4">An agreement may be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, cautioning that the talks could still fall apart.</seg>
<seg id="5">The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.</seg>
<seg id="6">The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are not public.</seg>

<seg id="4">All candidates must first obtain majority backing from a nominating committee likely to be stacked with Beijing loyalists.</seg>
<seg id="5">The decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot prompted pro-democracy activists to renew their vow to bring Hong Kong's financial hub to a halt with "Occupy Central" protests.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demands Kiev open 'statehood' talks with eastern Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease battling separatists in the country's east and immediately begin negotiations on the breakaway region's "statehood," according to Russian news accounts of his remarks.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin didn't mean to imply that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Putin's call upon the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russia insurgents as equals corresponded with the apparent strategy he has followed since the violence began five months ago: Help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region virtual independence to align with Russia instead of the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with state-run Channel One television, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to recover separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were seized in March and April, after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have lately branded the seized territory "Novorossiya," or "New Russia," a term that harkens to pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin said that anyone who believed peace talks are in the offing as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns for an Oct. 26 parliamentary election and while government troops are attacking civilian communities in separatist-held regions is "a prisoner to illusions," Itar-Tass reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately commence substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the statehood status of southeast Ukraine in order to serve the interests of people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood was meant in the context of the broader autonomy that has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership as it struggles to allay fears in the Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's not a matter to be negotiated between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it's not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Kremlin spokesman's intercession to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the Russian leadership's approach to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east differently from its outright seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have a much more difficult fight to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian and pre-conflict polls showed broad support for staying within Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would grant regional governments in Ukraine the authority to determine their own trade agreements and foreign relations, effectively handing the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago is home to Russia's main naval fleet as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic coastal resorts.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between Russia's Rostov area and Crimea are also home to mines, factories and foundries that produce vital components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections -- weigh constitutional amendments to give more control to the disparate regions over their finances and the status of languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But his vision of autonomy appears to differ sharply from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels Moscow is accused of arming and instigating.</seg>
<seg id="19">Putin's latest call on Kiev to deal with the separatist leaders as equals followed new advances by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Russian-backed separatists took control of the town of Novoazovsk in a drive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the opening of a campaign to seize the strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">That has spurred a massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a steelmaking port of 500,000 that lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway into the Crimean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to urge action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are close to the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The EU summit took no definitive action; the leaders called for drafting more punishing sanctions on Russia to be imposed in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armor and 1,000 troops last week moved into the Donetsk region to bolster the beleaguered separatists, Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="27">The first of a reported 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped in Ilovaysk by the Russian incursion were swapped Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured inside Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Geoffrey Edelsten has vented his disgust at hackers who may have stolen nude images of fiancee Gabi Grecko and a who's who of Hollywood A-listers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tinseltown is reeling after a series of explicit photos showing a nude Jennifer Lawrence hit the internet in a major celebrity hacking scandal.</seg>
<seg id="4">The hacker responsible is said to have 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and superstars including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actors Kirsten Dunst.</seg>
<seg id="5">Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Melbourne-based Grecko also had personal pictures allegedly retrieved due to an iCloud leak.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are 101 celebrity names on the list.</seg>
<seg id="7">Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting".</seg>
<seg id="8">All private correspondence and images should remain private.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's disgraceful that personal information can be stolen and dispersed to others.</seg>
<seg id="10">Grecko, who is in New York, reportedly told a news website the hacking was "shameful" and those targeted would "feel violated."</seg>
<seg id="11">The hacker is believed to have 30 images of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two frames where she is lounging topless in a pool.</seg>
<seg id="12">Palmer's film credits include Love And Honor, opposite Liam Hemsworth.</seg>
<seg id="13">Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actress Browning yesterday had no comment on the hacked pictures.</seg>

<seg id="1">The potential method for stealing photos of nude celebrities has been discovered</seg>
<seg id="2">It is possible that the massive hack of celebrities’ accounts was carried out using a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Next Web resource described the potential scenario of events.</seg>
<seg id="4">A script written in Python language was published on the GitHub resource, which made it possible to collect passwords for the Find My Phone service from Apple.</seg>
<seg id="5">This service makes it possible to keep an eye on an iPhone’s location.</seg>
<seg id="6">To gain access to it one uses the same Apple ID login and password combination that is used to gain access to Apple iCloud, which is where the photographs of celebrities were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="7">The script made it possible to use a brute-force computing method to figure out the Find My Phone password.</seg>
<seg id="8">With this approach, every possible combination of symbols is sequentially entered, starting with the most commonly used passwords.</seg>
<seg id="9">The script’s creator confirmed that the Find My Phone service has an infinite number of password input variations.</seg>
<seg id="10">When it’s working properly, the security system should block an account after several unsuccessful login attempts and alert the user about the attempted attack.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of a vulnerability, the users didn’t receive any messages about the attempt to match the password to their account.</seg>
<seg id="12">The hackers figured out the password from Apple ID and then used it to gain access to iCloud.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Hackapp’s message on Twitter, the vulnerability was found two days ago, on Saturday, and a script programme was then written for it in order to collect the passwords.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the present time, the vulnerability has been fixed: after the five failed login attempts, the service is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="15">The resource contacted the Hackapp user and he noted that the aforementioned vulnerability is common with many services; however, he also noted that he has no proof that this specific vulnerability was used to gain access to the “stars’” accounts.</seg>
<seg id="16">It’s not me, plz RT</seg>
<seg id="17">Once again unauthorized messages have shown up on the Prime Minister’s Twitter account</seg>
<seg id="18">Although there is no hard evidence that the vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photographs, there has already been a wave of injurious acts committed using that service.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hackers intercepted control of a device and ordered owners to pay ransom.</seg>
<seg id="20">In that case, Apple told the media that the safety of the cloud was not compromised in this incidence, however, they had not conducted an investigation into how the users lost their accounts.</seg>
<seg id="21">In Russia, the Twitter account of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, was also previously hacked.</seg>
<seg id="22">If the hackers gained access to iCloud using the above-described method, then the password to the account of the head of the government may also be stored in the microblog service.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Next Web resource was not able to get a comment from Apple regarding the Find My Phone vulnerability.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger turns out the be the most universal and functional of human emotions</seg>
<seg id="2">An angry facial expression turns out to be biologically universal to all of humankind, and every organ and muscle that participates in the creation of this expression is not accidental, but rather an additional means of expressing power and intimidation, scholars from Australia and the USA have discovered.</seg>
<seg id="3">They discuss their discoveries in the journal, Evolution and Human Behavior, but a summary of them can be read in a press release from the University of California, Santa Barbara.</seg>
<seg id="4">An angry facial expression – knitted and downcast brows, lips stretched into a thin line, flared nostrils – is the same across all cultures, and even congenitally blind children, having never seen it before, do it, notes the study’s lead author, Aaron Sell.</seg>
<seg id="5">As part of a major research project devoted to the nature of anger, scholars discovered that this emotion was developed to effectively manage disputes during a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">The greater one’s ability to cause physical injury to another, the more opportunities one has to dictate their terms, and a person is able to convey this to their interlocutor through anger.</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers also found confirmation of their other hypothesis: physically strong people become angry more frequently and are more likely to resort to physical force, they consider themselves entitled to dictate unfavourable terms to others, and they prefer forceful rather then peaceful means to resolving conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="8">Starting from the notion that anger is primarily a “bargaining emotion”, the scholars decided that the movement of each of the seven groups of muscles that create an angry facial expression should make the angry person look more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of their interlocutor, thereby forcing agreement with the angry person’s demands as quickly as possible in order to avoid conflict.</seg>
<seg id="9">To test this hypothesis, the researchers created a computerized facial model, to which they added or removed each of the seven elements of an angry face, and then showed it to their test subjects.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although downcast eyebrows or a pushed out chin on their own didn’t make the face look malicious, study participants unanimously recognized an image of a more physically strong person with the same characteristics as being such.</seg>
<seg id="11">Human anger, just as in animals, conveys a threat: an exaggerated expression of one’s personal strength that compels others to consent and obey.</seg>
<seg id="12">A person flares their nostrils and presses their lips together for the same reason that a frog puffs itself up, or a baboon bares its teeth.</seg>
<seg id="13">“Anger is ‘triggered’ when an interlocutor declines to accept the situation, and the face immediately takes on a form that is maximally effective in demonstrating to the opposing side the consequences of that refusal.</seg>
<seg id="14">But what’s most astonishing is that not one of the components of an angry face is arbitrary, they all express the very same message”, anthropologist, John Tooby notes.</seg>
