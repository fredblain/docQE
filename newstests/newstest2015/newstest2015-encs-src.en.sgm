<seg id="1">Petr Čech: Transfer at the last minute?</seg>
<seg id="2">Everything is possible</seg>
<seg id="3">Today is the last day when it is still possible to jump through the transfer window and make a major change.</seg>
<seg id="4">The next chance won't come until winter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Petr Čech is currently a substitute goalkeeper for Chelsea, but now he does not await a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or even Paris.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is sitting at the NH Hotel in Prague, talking to Czech reporters, and he is planning to participate with the Czech team in a rehearsal match with the Americans, after which he will also start the process of qualification for Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="7">Chelsea will give priority in the new season of the Premier League to Thibaut Courtois in the goal, and Čech for the first time in ten years in the London team has ended up in the position of substitute.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some time ago, it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in Čech.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the start of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup in competition with Athletics and did not even manage to enter the league season, when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.</seg>
<seg id="10">Interest from Paris SG was also speculated about.</seg>
<seg id="11">It started the French League season with two wins and two draws, and on Sunday it defeated St. Etienne 5:0.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is putting the most pressure on AS Monaco.</seg>
<seg id="13">It so far has a balance of 1-1-2 in the league, and over the weekend it parted with Lille with a 1:1 tie.</seg>
<seg id="14">Today news appeared on tabloid English-language websites stating that the Queens Park Rangers may want Čech.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, according to English bookmakers, Čech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.</seg>
<seg id="16">Skybet assigned him odds of 4:1.</seg>
<seg id="17">Petr, is it possible that during the remaining few hours you will change your uniform?</seg>
<seg id="18">I don't anticipate it, but in soccer nothing is ever 100%.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, during the day an offer can arrive that can't be refused.</seg>
<seg id="20">How would such an offer have to look?</seg>
<seg id="21">(laughs) "Well, I don't know yet, how the kind of offer that can't be refused basically looks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There would have to be a consensus among all parties, and mainly would depend on Chelsea's position as to whether or not to examine the offer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Is it even technically possible to make such a transfer when you're in Prague now?</seg>
<seg id="24">Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in a new location?</seg>
<seg id="25">Well, I haven't considered that.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in such a situation, there are a lot of players today, and all of them are somewhere in representation matches, and certainly today a lot of transfers will be finalized.</seg>
<seg id="27">So it could be somewhat achievable.</seg>
<seg id="28">How many clubs are there in the world that could afford you?</seg>
<seg id="29">Well, I really don't know.</seg>
<seg id="30">And are you not pushing for departure?</seg>
<seg id="31">The situation when I have not ended up anywhere as a goalkeeper in the first three games of the new season is new for my fifteen-year career.</seg>
<seg id="32">Nonetheless, there is no need to panic, pack up and go somewhere.</seg>
<seg id="33">I want to stay in the competition for the position of Chelsea goalkeeper, and it's up to the coach who gets selected and what decisions he will make in the weeks to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">What role has your family played in your decisions?</seg>
<seg id="35">I take all factors into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sports prospects are understandably important for me, but I also look at everything from a personal point of view, which of course includes consideration for the family's needs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Is it possible that you could play as a goalkeeper for different team in England?</seg>
<seg id="38">That's a question that I though would never apply to me.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in soccer everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">I don't want to rule out anything.</seg>
<seg id="41">I don't know the answer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Reconnecting With the Very American Ideal That Labor Rights Are Human Rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"As go unions, so go middle-class jobs," says Ellison, the Minnesota Democrat who serves as a Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's why I'm proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act with civil rights icon John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This ground-breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti-union forces in their tracks</seg>
<seg id="6">Amending the National Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for engaging in union organizing to sue for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compensatory and punitive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the cosponsors of their legislation are proposing is as a reconnection with a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the battering that unions have taken in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to embrace, extend and respect labor rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, within the living memory of millions of Americans, when this country championed democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize in the same breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that Hideki Tojo's militarized autocracy would be replaced with democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan, they included language that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize and to bargain and act collectively is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides urged the Germans to write a constitution that would assure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced with muscular democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers would need to organize and make their voices heard in the new nation, the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared: "The right to form associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or profession.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to impair this right shall be null and void; measures directed to this end shall be unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that would in 1948 be adopted by the United Nations as a global covenant, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">For generations, Americans accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country counseled other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, with those rights under assault in America, it is wise, indeed, to recommit to the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not diminish the strength of the nation but enlarged it.</seg>
<seg id="23">By raising the living standards of millions, labor miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to undreamed of levels of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack labor forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers, as should we.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing ideals that have historically enlarged America and made real the promise of democracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judge temporarily blocks law that could close all Louisiana abortion clinics</seg>
<seg id="2">A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked enforcement of a Louisiana law that advocates say would likely have closed all five abortion clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">The measure, signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and due to take effect Sept. 1, would require doctors who perform abortions to have patient admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the judge's ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while seeking such privileges.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Plaintiffs will be allowed to operate lawfully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in the decision.</seg>
<seg id="6">A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Abortion rights activists applauded the decision, the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privileges.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's ruling ensures Louisiana women are safe from an underhanded law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued to block the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the suit and have also applied for admitting privileges.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently ruling unconstitutional such measures in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of a Texas law that would have shuttered most remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abortion rights campaigners, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admitting privileges laws impose medically unnecessary requirements on doctors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anti-abortion advocates have countered that the measures aim to protect women's health, though some have also lauded their effect of shuttering clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admitting privileges, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, that doctor, fearful for his safety, would stop carrying out the procedure, the group said.</seg>
<seg id="16">In arguing against the ruling, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors performing abortions while their applications for admitting privileges were pending.</seg>

<seg id="1">Delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment mean ovarian cancer kills more in rural areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their late mother who died of Ovarian cancer in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="3">Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their city counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="4">Researchers analysed medical records of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding just 35 per cent lived for five years after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lead researcher Susan Jordan, of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, said those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">SMALL STUDY: New drugs may slow lung, ovarian cancer</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers tracked the women's medical journeys across seven years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Dr Jordan said a woman's age at the time of diagnosis, ovarian cancer type, having existing illnesses and socio-economic status also impacted on survival chances.</seg>
<seg id="9">Older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the poorest survival rates.</seg>
<seg id="10">Those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr Jordan suggested delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment might be factors.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncology surgeons and they're mostly based in major cities," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite improving tele-medicine services to lessen the tyranny of distance, she suggested more fly-in, fly-out services to allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people in treatment away from their communities could help.</seg>
<seg id="14">Dr Jordan said regardless of geographical status, the study found long-term survival among women with ovarian cancer was poor, reinforcing the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.</seg>
<seg id="15">The research, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.</seg>
<seg id="16">In March 2012, at 33 years of age, young Gold Coast mum Elisha Neave was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Garden centres rue fall in homeowners</seg>
<seg id="2">The drop, coupled with a particular decline in the number of homeowners aged under 35, could result in garden centres losing out on tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the "core gardening age group," according to the HTA's study, which was reported by the Financial Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the report, people renting properties spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that those with their own homes spend on their gardens.</seg>
<seg id="4">It cited the rise in people living in highly urbanised areas with no gardens, the popularity of paving over front gardens for parking and shrinking garden size as other factors threatening the industry, which is worth an estimated £5 billion in sales each year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Greater London, where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, has Britain's lowest spend per household on gardening products.</seg>
<seg id="6">The HTA and Royal Horticultural Society said that renting property or a lack of garden space did not mean people could not grow plants.</seg>
<seg id="7">Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser to the RHS, said: "Container gardening, for example, is especially popular with renters who can move their plants when they relocate."</seg>
<seg id="8">The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the garden retail sector's 'golden age" as a result of increased home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to mid-1990s.</seg>
<seg id="9">It also predicted an improved market this year due to better weather following unfavourable conditions in March and April last year.</seg>

<seg id="1">When an Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.</seg>
<seg id="2">At a meeting of his youth organization, which must resembles Hitler Youth, rattled his sabers by pointing out that Russia has nuclear weapons and basically made clear to everyone that he doesn't care about their opinions, today he gave us a lecture about democracy.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia has many characteristics of a Fascist state.</seg>
<seg id="4">Large countries have one thing in common, and that is that they can both take advantage of passionate nationalism and transform an inferiority complex into imperialist appetites.</seg>
<seg id="5">Time apparently passes differently in the East than in the West.</seg>
<seg id="6">While the Western world has been believing that the era of wars and dominance over Europe is over, in the East they think on the contrary that they have been overlooked for too long already and that it is necessary to regain their international position.</seg>
<seg id="7">Such moods and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, shortly before the Nazis took power, and that was followed by an eruption of nationalism not unlike today's situation in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="8">The absolutely identical cult of a powerful leader, beating of journalists, liquidation of political opponents and discrimination against gays and other minorities are all very close to that mindset.</seg>
<seg id="9">Vladimir Putin and certainly many Russians apparently miss the time when Russia ruled half of the world and the other half feared it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Western politicians must have caused it themselves, maybe by not patting Vladimir on the shoulders enough, maybe by not inviting him to where he wanted to go and maybe by starting to underestimate him, after which he just behaved like a typical Russian strongman.</seg>
<seg id="11">He established order at home, he acted like he didn't even want to go anywhere, and he sharpened his knives at home.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now he has decided that he wants to regain his country's lost position.</seg>
<seg id="13">He'll start gradually, because he has time.</seg>
<seg id="14">He'll probably be leader for life, so why hurry?</seg>
<seg id="15">He stepped on the Caucasus, now he's stepping on Ukraine, and the dwarfs from the Baltics are probably next.</seg>
<seg id="16">They have been a thorn in the eye of the Russian bear for a long time already.</seg>
<seg id="17">This certainly will also be noticed by China, who has been making a lot of waves and has its eye on the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="18">And the Germans too are really upsetting Vladimir with how well they are doing, and we really kicked their asses in 1945.</seg>
<seg id="19">How about establishing a Novorossiya in Karlovy Vary?</seg>
<seg id="20">That could be a small base, and there are plenty of compatriots there, and they are so oppressed there, and some locals already have wanted to demolish some of their houses.</seg>
<seg id="21">After all, our veterans still remember how well they had it in Czechoslovakia.</seg>
<seg id="22">And their prime minister, Gospodin Sobotka, he so soft that he can be peeled like an onion, and with him their entire EU too.</seg>
<seg id="23">That's how it would play out, so that great Russia could re-emerge.</seg>
<seg id="24">They need to be reminded where their place is.</seg>
<seg id="25">And we can use our countrymen who live on their territory as weapons.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are plenty of Russians everywhere, and when it is said that they are oppressed, then they are simply oppressed, and we will not leave it like that, but we will protect them.</seg>
<seg id="27">And then the Russians will be in control again, because what else are they born for after all?</seg>
<seg id="28">After all, Europe is merely a stepping stone, on which proud Ivan can do a Cossack dance.</seg>

<seg id="3">The head of Calvià police on the holiday island of Majorca has been arrested following corruption claims filed by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot of Magaluf.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro has been remanded in custody following corruption claims made against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to online daily Mallorca Diario, the claimants presented proof of extortion by policemen and Calvià Town Hall civil servants at the office of Majorca's anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Two other local police officers were arrested by Spanish Civil Guards in connection to the corruption claims and will have to be questioned by a judge alongside Navarro.</seg>

<seg id="2">SPRING has sprung a wintry surprise on southern South Australia, bringing heavy showers and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport.</seg>
<seg id="3">A further 5mm of rain fell on the city in the evening up to 9pm, following the 6.6mm that fell overnight on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The latest rain came courtesy of a couple of short, blustery showers, including a burst that started just before 8pm that dumped almost 4mm in about 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="5">After winter delivered an early dose of spring last week, temperatures dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The squally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.</seg>
<seg id="7">The plane was scheduled to land just after 7.30pm but was hit by windshear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out.</seg>
<seg id="8">Wind gusts were reaching about 50km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.</seg>
<seg id="9">Flight data showed the plane had to pull out of second landing and the plane eventually touched down about 8.40pm.</seg>
<seg id="10">That flight's delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars rained on their communities during the 50-day Israel-Hamas war, while schools in Gaza remained shuttered as the territory recovered from the fighting.</seg>
<seg id="3">The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to rocket-scarred communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting remained fresh.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the southern city of Ashdod, employees at the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was struck by a rocket, removed shrapnel marks off the walls and slides ahead of the students' arrival.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We are a little scared but we are excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher in its school.</seg>
<seg id="6">A lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt a "little bit weird" to suddenly be going back to school.</seg>
<seg id="8">"There were some difficult times and we didn't leave our houses at all," she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is located close to the Gaza border, to offer his support.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until a cease-fire halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire.</seg>
<seg id="11">Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community close to the Gaza frontier where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are hesitant about coming back.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Education Ministry said about a dozen families still had not returned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their children have been placed in alternate schools for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="14">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a Gaza border town that has been hard hit by Palestinian fire.</seg>
<seg id="15">He urged the children to study hard and said "we will make sure to provide you with knowledge and provide you with security."</seg>
<seg id="16">Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce last Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cease-fire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of an Israel-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and seaports.</seg>
<seg id="18">Israel wants Hamas to disarm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="20">The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and U.N. estimates.</seg>
<seg id="21">Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants, though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting, mostly in the south.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Israeli military, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters.</seg>
<seg id="26">With tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I hope the school will open soon to complete our education, just like the world's children and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy staying in a Gaza City school.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vrba at event: I'm behind Váchou.</seg>
<seg id="2">And Lafata has a fever</seg>
<seg id="3">Today before noon, the Czech soccer team met in Prague ahead of the Wednesday preparatory match with the United States and the subsequent initial match of the qualification for the European Championship in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the team's 23 members, Sparta's offensive player David Lafata, has a fever.</seg>
<seg id="5">David is not here yet, but last week Sparta had some problems, which involved multiple players, and David apparently still has some of those problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">But we want him to be here and for him to be feeling better as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Whether it will be two or three days or he will be fit tomorrow will depend on his health condition, about which our doctor will decide.</seg>
<seg id="8">The other players are fine.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Of course, someone has some pain from time to time, but it's not so bad that they cannot practice or participate in the match with the United States on Wednesday," the Czech coach said.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Sunday evening, Vrba called up Sparta reserve player Lukáše Váchu last.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has admitted that it was not an easy decision, and other mid-fielders were considered.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I made my decision based on the fact that Lukáš is a perspective player who is 25 years old.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was very difficult, but I stand behind it," Vrba said regarding Váchu.</seg>
<seg id="14">And what about Šural?</seg>
<seg id="15">Time will tell what will happen with Lafata.</seg>
<seg id="16">The possibility that the nomination could still be changed if there are health problems cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the weekend, Liberec's Josef Šural, for example, performed excellently when he did a hat trick.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course, they are players who have been demonstrating their talent recently.</seg>
<seg id="19">Time will tell how David Lafata will feel.</seg>
<seg id="20">If he will not be available on Wednesday, then I don't claim that I cannot nominate another player who has performed well in the Czech league to replace him," Vrba said.</seg>
<seg id="21">This afternoon, the Czech team will face training in Strahov, and on Tuesday it will face traditional pre-match training before the duel with the United States at Letné, which will be open for fans and will be followed by autograph signing.</seg>
<seg id="22">The match with the Americans will start on Wednesday at 8:15 p.m., and in it the national team hopes to achieve a premier victory under Vrba's coaching.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the last three preparatory matches, there were two draws, and it lost one game.</seg>
<seg id="24">The qualification match with the Netherlands will start at 8:45 p.m. on 9 September.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pešice to represent the Netherlands in Italy</seg>
<seg id="26">Vrba is glad that unlike during previous matches he has more time for training.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It's an advantage, when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them, which we didn't have as much time for before.</seg>
<seg id="28">Now we will be able to focus only on preparing as best as possible for the Netherlands," Vrba explained.</seg>
<seg id="29">Before the game in Prague, the Dutch team will play in Italy on Thursday, and the match will be watched personally by temporary team coach Josef Pešice.</seg>
<seg id="30">He will give us information from the match as it becomes available.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it won't be only about him. We will also have the game filmed, and we will analyze it.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is a new trainer coming to the Netherlands, so we will see what kinds of changes there will be," Vrba said, referring to the bronze medalists from the recent World Championship.</seg>

<seg id="1">Housing prices have posted their strongest winter gain in seven years, according to a widely-watched gauge.</seg>
<seg id="2">The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic home value index of Australian capital city dwelling prices rose by 1.1 per cent in August, RP data said on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The rise brought the total gain over the June, July and August to 4.2 per cent, the biggest rise over the winter months since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annual growth in prices came in at 10.9 per cent, more than double the gain of the 12 months to August 2013, but the gains were not evenly spread across the country.</seg>
<seg id="5">RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two tier market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The RP Data figures show Sydney home prices rose by 16.1 per cent in the past year, while Melbourne's were up by 11.7 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="7">The next strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price rises averaging between five and six per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the other end of the scale was Canberra, hit by government spending cutbacks, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent through the year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Lawless said that now spring has begun there would be a rise in listings of properties for sale over the coming few months, which would be a "real test" for the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates, a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it's likely that dwelling values will rise even further over the next three months," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.</seg>
<seg id="2">Never said "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the tunes are upbeat.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry has had to work through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">There was "a lot" of therapy after his mother died and Henry is reflective about his relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very unknowable.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: 'Stop the noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Leave your sister alone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Move!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown-up when I was a kid - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass, the beauty of the stroke in cricket.</seg>
<seg id="15">I never had a conversation with him like that.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was this unsmiling bloke in the corner, reading the paper for a lot of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in his father's day, he got a snapshot of what life must have been like for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's a bit brighter now but they're dark, smoky, Stygian labyrinthine depths with bursts of flame and smoke and lots of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My dad used to get in the bath and just lie there and you'd hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would wash the foundry off him.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I walked round it, I realised that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table, and my estimation of him went up.</seg>
<seg id="21">None the less, Henry emerged from a childhood stripped of parental affection.</seg>
<seg id="22">My dad never did hugging, never said, 'I love you'.</seg>
<seg id="23">It wasn't until my mum was poorly near the end of her life that we started saying 'I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">Having a daughter of his own, Billie, with Dawn French, enabled him to share the love he missed as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">Could you stop with the "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just stop hugging me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why wouldn't I be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mum</seg>
<seg id="31">He's still very good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn's a good person.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why wouldn't I be friends with Dawn?</seg>
<seg id="34">She's a great mum.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry's own mother was diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="36">It was one of the things that killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So when I became very, very overweight and started getting diabetic symptoms, my doctor said, 'You've got to be radical.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I went on a big fitness thing, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it's tedious.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nobody likes eating carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">Henry's change in career trajectory is, perhaps, reflected in his distinguished, close-cropped beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he won critical acclaim for his Othello, he has become engrossed in the theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">Comedy of Errors followed, as did Fences by August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have upholstered his busy working life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and wrote to New Faces about him.</seg>
<seg id="48">His TV career was launched in the mid-Seventies: "For quite a long time I was the only black impressionist/comedian on telly."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learnt on the job.</seg>
<seg id="50">Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye, I had to learn how to be an efficient joke-delivering mechanism between 1975 and 1985, whilst being a star, being on television and it was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny on New Faces in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">Because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment programme in which people "blacked up," Henry found himself performing his comedy in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family were very uncomfortable about it.</seg>
<seg id="54">I sort of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Although it was a weird, reprehensible position to be in, I was working in huge venues and learning how to work a crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But what was an "award-winning light entertainment staple of British television for years and years" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">Introducing characters who both lampooned and celebrated black British culture, Henry worked on the alternative comedy circuit in the Eighties.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first series of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the Nineties he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.</seg>
<seg id="59">Advertisements, documentaries, TV series and parts in films consumed his next decade but after his 2008 BBC series, LennyHenry.tv, he thought: "What are you going to do next, Len, because it all feels a bit like you're marking time or you're slightly going sideways."</seg>
<seg id="60">What came next was a Radio 4 documentary series called What's So Great About...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was on Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">I wasn't really taught it at school properly and thought it was very much the reserve of middle-class white people with tights and a cabbage down the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I was very frightened of it.</seg>
<seg id="65">Everybody we interviewed on that show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, 'You should try it.</seg>
<seg id="66">Don't slag it off if you don't know what you're talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Get some of the words in your mouth and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry delivered 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was hooked.</seg>
<seg id="69">It gave me the feeling that I could do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">It's almost like I had my head put on straight for me.</seg>
<seg id="71">'This is what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your lines, do some research.</seg>
<seg id="72">So the rehearsal process was brutal and I was reading that play for months and months before we did it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They seemed to expect a car crash and it didn't quite happen.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon he was starring in Comedy of Errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre and I just couldn't quite believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment where I thought, 'Oh, you've changed.""</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical fault and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to keep the audience entertained.</seg>
<seg id="79">"A little voice inside me said, 'You're going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer.""</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the stage manager announced the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked off the stage and something in me went, "Oh, thank God".</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can let somebody else sort it out.</seg>
<seg id="84">'You're in a play, stay in character.""</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry appearing in Fences at the Duchess Theatre</seg>
<seg id="86">Learning his lines for Fences was challenging.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic's quite good, it stiffens the sinews.</seg>
<seg id="88">That was well received too, so it's like a big sign from the gods, saying, 'This is what you should be doing.""</seg>
<seg id="89">He says this, of course, in a BOOMING voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I'm sticking with it.</seg>
<seg id="91">I'm really loving it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love being in a rehearsal room.</seg>
<seg id="93">Henry still has a comedian's brain, though - throughout, our conversation is broken with flashes of his humour as he slips in and out of impressions.</seg>
<seg id="94">I'm just choosing not to do stand-up because that thing of getting instant gratification from a room full of strangers I guess is kind of dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you're constantly seeking that it can lead to a brick wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I do Live at the Apollo sometimes when I want to, but generally it doesn't float my boat like it used to.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask whether he'll ever do another stand-up tour.</seg>
<seg id="98">The joy of sitting in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning, middle and end of a journey - I don't think I'll ever want to give that up.</seg>
<seg id="99">So this is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like being an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's good fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">You're always telling a story and that's a great place to be.</seg>
<seg id="104">I love stories.</seg>
<seg id="105">People love stories.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kenya has started biometrically registering all civil servants in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from the government's payroll.</seg>
<seg id="3">Employees who failed to register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service.</seg>
<seg id="5">President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to curb corruption in the public service after taking office in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="6">An audit earlier this year found that at least $1m (£700,000) a month was lost in payments to "ghost workers" and other financial malpractice.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.</seg>
<seg id="8">All public servants are required to present themselves over the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure their data is captured through the biometric registration exercise, a government statement said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anyone who failed to do so without a valid excuse would be eliminated from the payroll, it said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This exercise will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual numbers of public servants and will also be used to cleanse the payroll at both levels of government- hence bring a stop to the issue of 'ghost workers'," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Devolution and Planning.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the formidable chief it needs</seg>
<seg id="2">She comes trailing clouds of glory from the world of banking, media management and the inner conclaves of the Tory party.</seg>
<seg id="3">Indeed, she has had frontline experience of her own.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her career began at global management consultants Bain and Co, then progressed via Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.</seg>
<seg id="5">She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when the top job at its parent company Pearson's went to a junior male colleague.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her pay-off is said to be close to £1 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her political rating is sturdy, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former head of BP, when he was looking to bring private expertise into Whitehall: she became a cabinet office adviser.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her husband is a former Tory councillor.</seg>
<seg id="10">Back in May, I described the chairman's job as a poisoned chalice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is an inner paradox to its structure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The trust faces in two directions: inwards as the upper tier of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also outwards as the voice of public concern and disquiet when things go awry.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is an almost untenable duopoly calling for complete root-and-branch reform.</seg>
<seg id="14">But what incoming chairman would risk coming in, crashing around and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty in case they put themselves out of a job in the process.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's a difficult call.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that weren't tough enough, plenty of people are keen to see the BBC cut down in size - its power, its finances and its status overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="17">As competitors circle ever closer and new technology challenges cosy old certainties, the imminent negotiation of the licence fee is fraught with especial danger for the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public buys into what is surely the greatest media enterprise in the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its output reaches 96 per cent of households, and costs each one of them just 40p a day.</seg>
<seg id="20">What's more, apparently the Beeb's popularity is rising: 53 per cent support today as against 31 per cent 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">Patterns of watching and using the BBC have changed: I receive news headlines on my mobile phone these days, and catch up on missed programmes with iPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it remains a much-loved and formidable institution.</seg>

<seg id="2">A tweet from Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry's verified account on Sunday night included a disparaging image of the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of his criminal indictment on charges of abuse of power.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account that disavowed the post.</seg>
<seg id="4">A tweet just went out from my account that was unauthorized.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I do not condone the tweet and I have taken it down," the later post said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perry aides did not immediately return messages seeking comment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although the tweets were sent from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who does the actual posting for the feed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The earlier tweet posted an unflattering mock image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">Perry vetoed funds to her office when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury in Austin this month indicting Perry - who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="10">The caption on the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk at 3x the legal blood alcohol limit ... but when I do, I indict Gov. Perry for calling me out about it."</seg>
<seg id="11">I am the most drunk Democrat in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Lehmberg's office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Perry.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was handled by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio-based special prosecutor who was assigned by a Republican judge.</seg>
<seg id="14">Perry has pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.</seg>
<seg id="15">His high-powered legal team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the law being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutionally vague.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perry cut off $7.5 million in state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and prosecutes public corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.</seg>
<seg id="17">That veto drew a formal complaint from a left-leaning watchdog group.</seg>
<seg id="18">Perry's verified account is updated frequently - and sometimes famously.</seg>
<seg id="19">After finishing in fifth place in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry addressed speculation that he might call it quits with a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, and the words, "Here we come South Carolina!"</seg>

<seg id="2">One of London's most prominent property developers has warned that the housing market in southeast England has "reverted" to normal levels of activity.</seg>
<seg id="3">Homes in the capital have been the subject of red-hot demand and surging prices, with widespread fears of a credit bubble prompting the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage borrowing in June.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of upmarket housebuilder Berkeley, on Monday said: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has reverted to normal transaction levels from the high point in 2013," adding that this offered a "stable operating environment."</seg>
<seg id="5">London's property market fared well during the downturn as foreign buyers piled into the capital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Prices in the city have leapt 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to Land Registry data, far outstripping the 6.7 per cent average for England and Wales as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="7">Average selling prices on Berkeley's private, affordable and student schemes have risen by about a fifth in the past year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, a strengthening pound has in recent months made London property less attractive to foreign buyers - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion tax" ahead of the general election next May.</seg>
<seg id="9">London estate agent Foxtons last week warned that April's Mortgage Market Review, which introduced tougher lending rules, would also spark lower rates of market growth in both property sales transactions and prices during the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of mortgage approvals in July, further suggesting the housing market is cooling.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hamptons International, another estate agent, has cut its 2015 forecast for London property price growth to 3 per cent on the basis that house price sentiment is already starting to weaken.</seg>
<seg id="12">Transaction volumes have meanwhile dropped by a quarter year on year in London's most expensive postcodes, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to agent WA Ellis.</seg>
<seg id="13">Still, appetite for homes in the capital has been a boon to Berkeley, pushing up cash due on forward sales to more than £2.2bn.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Pidgley added: "Demand for the right product with good design in the best locations has remained resilient and, reflecting this, forward sales have been maintained."</seg>
<seg id="15">In June the company reported it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="16">Annual pre-tax profits rose 40 per cent year on year to £380m, on revenues up 18 per cent to £1.6bn.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking on Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said Berkeley's earnings for the year were anticipated to be in line with current market expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Analyst consensus is for full-year pre-tax profit of £450m.</seg>
<seg id="19">Berkeley shares were flat at £23.96 in afternoon London trading.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence have been leaked online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of 100 other starlets.</seg>
<seg id="4">A representative for the star of "The Hunger Games" confirmed the photos of Lawrence were real and blasted the hacker for "a flagrant violation of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="5">The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.</seg>
<seg id="6">The photos, which originally were posted on the image-sharing site 4chan, were purportedly obtained through a weakness in Apple's iCloud online storage system, and a purported "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not clear how many of the images are authentic, though "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" star Winstead took to Twitter to denounce the hack as well.</seg>
<seg id="8">"To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home, hope you feel great about yourselves," Winstead tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, Victoria Justice, of the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious," denied that the photos were of her, tweeting, "These so called nudes of me are FAKE people.</seg>
<seg id="10">Let me nip this in the bud right now. *pun intended*.</seg>
<seg id="11">Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied that purported photos of her were authentic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter 'J'</seg>
<seg id="2">They dissolved, that was the best way of putting it, they gradually came apart like a cardboard box that had been left out in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Just occasionally a woman told him he was too serious, hard-going, intense, detached, and maybe a bit prickly.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then shook his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">He recognised prickly.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was spiny, like a hedgehog, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The latest casualty of this spininess was an embryo-affair that had given greater promise than usual of relieving the lonely tedium of his life, and perhaps even bringing him some content.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ailinn Solomons was a wild-haired, quiveringly delicate beauty with a fluttering heart from a northern island village more remote and rugged even than Port Reuben.</seg>
<seg id="9">She had come south with an older companion whom Kevern took to be her aunt, the latter having been left a property in a wet but paradisal valley called, felicitously, Paradise Valley.</seg>
<seg id="10">No one had lived in the house for several years.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pipes leaked, there were spiders still in the baths, slugs had signed their signatures on all the windows, believing the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown with weeds that resembled giant cabbages.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like a children's story cottage, threatening and enchanting at the same time, the garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is longlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist is announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">Kevern had been sitting holding hands with Ailinn on broken deckchairs in the long grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, the pair of them absent-mindedly plugged into the utility console that supplied the country with soothing music and calming news, when the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer his father had liked listening to with the cottage blinds down.</seg>
<seg id="16">Your feet's too big.</seg>
<seg id="17">On account of their innate aggressiveness, songs of that sort were no longer played on the console.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not banned - nothing was banned exactly - simply not played.</seg>
<seg id="19">Encouraged to fall into desuetude, like the word desuetude.</seg>
<seg id="20">Popular taste did what edict and proscription could never have done, and just as, when it came to books, the people chose rags-to-riches memoirs, cookbooks and romances, so, when it came to music, they chose ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">Carried away by the day, Kevern began to play at an imaginary piano and in a rudely comic voice serenade Ailinn's big feet.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ailinn didn't understand.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">This his father had always done to stifle the letter j before it left his lips.</seg>
<seg id="25">It had begun as a game between them when he was small.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father had played it with his own father, he'd told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Begin a word with a j without remembering to put two fingers across your mouth and it cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It had not been much fun then and it was not much fun now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew it was expected of him, that was all.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had to explain what jazz was.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ailinn had never heard any.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz, too, without exactly being proscribed, wasn't played.</seg>
<seg id="33">Improvisation had fallen out of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="34">There was room for only one "if" in life.</seg>
<seg id="35">People wanted to be sure, when a tune began, exactly where it was going to end.</seg>
<seg id="36">Wit, the same.</seg>
<seg id="37">Its unpredictability unsettled people's nerves.</seg>
<seg id="38">And jazz was wit expressed musically.</seg>
<seg id="39">Though he reached the age of 10 without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew of jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, she was unlikely to have remembered a time when popular singers weren't black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, no laws or duress.</seg>
<seg id="43">A compliant society meant that every section of it consented with gratitude - the gratitude of the providentially spared - to the principle of group aptitude.</seg>
<seg id="44">People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and physique to entertainment and athletics, and so they sang and sprinted.</seg>
<seg id="45">People originally from the Indian subcontinent, electronically gifted as though by nature, undertook to ensure no family was without a functioning utility phone.</seg>
<seg id="46">What was left of the Polish community plumbed; what was left of the Greek smashed plates.</seg>
<seg id="47">Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents hadn't quickly left the country while WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED was happening - fearing they'd be accused of having stoked the flames, fearing, indeed, that the flames would consume them next - opened labneh and shisha-pipe restaurants, kept their heads down, and grew depressed with idleness.</seg>
<seg id="48">To each according to his gifts.</seg>
<seg id="49">Having heard only ballads, Ailinn was hard pressed to understand how the insulting words Kevern had just sung to her could ever have been set to music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music was the expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They're not really insulting," Kevern said.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except maybe to people whose feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never insulted anybody, but he delighted in this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He was saying too much, but the garden's neglect gave the illusion of safety.</seg>
<seg id="55">No word could get beyond the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn still didn't comprehend.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why would your father have loved something like that?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say it was a joke, but was reluctant, in her company, to put two fingers to his lips again.</seg>
<seg id="59">She already thought he was strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It struck him as funny," he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">She shook her head in disbelief, blotting out Kevern's vision.</seg>
<seg id="62">Nothing to see in the whole wide world but her haystack of crow-black hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">Nothing else he wanted to see.</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you say so," she said, unconvinced.</seg>
<seg id="65">But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed in genuine distress.</seg>
<seg id="67">Are my feet too big?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked again.</seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet specifically, no.</seg>
<seg id="70">Your ankles, maybe, a bit...</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">Hate you?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course I don't hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">That's just the silly song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon for that.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Your thick ankles are the very reason I'm attracted to you," he tried instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I'm perverse that way.</seg>
<seg id="78">It came out wrong.</seg>
<seg id="79">He had meant it to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">Meaning to be funny often landed him in a mess because, like his father, he lacked the reassuring charm necessary to temper the cruelty that lurked in jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father intended to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he, Kevern, did.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite his kind eyes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn Solomons flushed and rose from her deckchair, knocking over the console and spilling the wine they'd been drinking.</seg>
<seg id="85">Elderflower wine, so drink wasn't his excuse.</seg>
<seg id="86">In her agitation she seemed to tremble, like the fronds of a palm tree in a storm.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And your thick head's the very reason I'm perversely attracted to you," she said...</seg>
<seg id="88">Except that I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="89">He felt sorry for her, both on account of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes in the moment of her standing up to him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Did she think he'd strike her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She hadn't spoken to him about life on the chill northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he didn't doubt it was in all essentials similar to here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same vast and icy ocean crashed in on them both.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same befuddled men, even more thin-skinned and peevish in the aftermath of WHAT HAPPENED than their smuggler and wrecker ancestors had been, roamed angrily from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand to any woman who dared to refuse or twit them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Thick head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They'd show her a thick fist, if she wasn't careful!</seg>
<seg id="96">Snog her first - the snog having become the most common expression of erotic irritation between men and women; an antidote to the bland ballads of love the console pumped out - snog her first and cuff her later.</seg>
<seg id="97">An unnecessary refinement in Kevern's view, since a snog was itself an act of thuggery.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn Solomons made a sign with her body for him to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He heaved himself out of the deckchair like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She felt leaden herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This wasn't the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She watched him go - as at an upstairs window her companion watched him go - a man made heavy by what he'd brought on himself.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam leaving the garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a pang for him and for men in general, no matter that some had raised their hands to her.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man turned from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, all the fight in him leaked away - why was that a sight she felt she knew so well, when she couldn't recall a single instance, before today, of having seen it?</seg>
<seg id="107">Alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">A score or so years before the events related above, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher employed by Ofnow, the non-statutory monitor of the Public Mood, prepared a short paper on the continuance of low- and medium-level violence in those very areas of the country where its reduction, if not its cessation, was most to have been expected, given the money and energy expended on uprooting it.</seg>
<seg id="109">"Much has been done, and much continues to be done," she wrote, "to soothe the native aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in those twisted knarls and narrow crevices of the country where, though the spires of churches soar above the hedgerows, the sweeter breath of human kindness has, historically, been rarely felt.</seg>
<seg id="110">But some qualities are proving to be ineradicable.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions it goes on engendering.</seg>
<seg id="112">The populace weeps to sentimental ballads, gorges on stories of adversity overcome, and professes to believe ardently in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the old brutishness retain a pertinacious hold equally on rural communities as on our urban conurbations, evidence suggests the emergence of a new and vicious quarrelsomeness in the home, in the workplace, on our roads and even on our playing fields.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have an unfortunate tendency to overwrite," her supervisor said when he had read the whole report.</seg>
<seg id="114">May I suggest you read fewer novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also enquire: are you an atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I believe I am not obliged to say," Esme Nussbaum replied.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you a lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Again Esme protested her right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">A feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Silence once more.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said at last, "because I have an objection to atheism, lesbianism or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">This is a prejudice-free workplace.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of a prejudice-free society.</seg>
<seg id="125">But certain kinds of hypersensitivity, while entirely acceptable and laudable in themselves, may sometimes distort findings such as you have presented to me.</seg>
<seg id="126">You are obviously yourself prejudiced against the church; and those things you call "vicious" and "brutish," others could as soon interpret as expressions of natural vigour and vitality.</seg>
<seg id="127">To still be harping on about WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as though it happened, if it happened, yesterday, is to sap the country of its essential life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme Nussbaum looked around her while Rabinowitz spoke.</seg>
<seg id="129">Behind his head a flamingo pink LED scroll repeated the advice Ofnow had been dispensing to the country for the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">Smile at your neighbour, cherish your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your telephone, converse, explain, listen, agree, apologise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Talk is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand the points you are making," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice, once she was certain her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I am saying no more than that we are not healed as effectively as we delude ourselves we are.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that, if we are not forewarned, we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time it will not be on others that we vent our anger and mistrust.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz made a pyramid of his fingers.</seg>
<seg id="136">This was to suggest infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "in describing as "mistakes" actions which our grandparents might or might not have taken.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far, as well, in speaking of them venting their "anger" and "mistrust" on "others."</seg>
<seg id="139">It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past, as in protecting the present, we do not speak of "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "we" and there were no "others."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of disorder, that is all we know of it.</seg>
<seg id="142">"In which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to interject, "no section of society can claim to have acquitted itself well.</seg>
<seg id="143">I make no accusations.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was done ill, or done well, what was done was done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then was then.</seg>
<seg id="146">No more needs to be said - on this we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And just as there is no blame to be apportioned, so there are no amends to be made, were amends appropriate and were there any way of making them.</seg>
<seg id="148">But what is the past for if not to learn from it -</seg>
<seg id="149">The past exists in order that we forget it.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I may add one word to that -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I will consider your report," he said, dismissing her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, turning up for work as usual, she was knocked down by a motorcyclist who had mounted the pavement in what passers-by described as a "vicious rage."</seg>
<seg id="154">Coincidences happen.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lesotho military officials denied staging a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were acting against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the country's military had surrounded his official home and seized government buildings in the capital of Maseru.</seg>
<seg id="4">The premier took his family to neighboring South Africa after saying he received an assassination threat.</seg>
<seg id="5">Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was not, in fact, a coup, but that the military was responding to a threat from "political fanatics" whom police were attempting to arm.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened this morning was that the command of the Lesotho Defense Force was acting after receiving several intelligence reports that amongst the police service, there are some elements who are actually planning to arm some of the political, party political youth fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc," he told Voice of America.</seg>
<seg id="7">South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military's actions had the appearance at an overthrow.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Although no one has claimed to have taken over government through the use of force, by all accounts the activities of the Lesotho defense force thus far bear the hallmarks of a coup d'etat," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lesotho military officials said soldiers returned to their barracks Sunday and there was calm in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="10">Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing in control of the government in Thabane's absence.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thabane said he believes he is being targeted due to his attempt to fight corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="12">Tensions have been high in Lesotho since June when Thabane suspended parliament sessions due to feuding in his unity government.</seg>

<seg id="2">Manufacturing growth in the eurozone slowed to a 13-month low in August, according to a closely-watched survey.</seg>
<seg id="3">The final Markit's Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">A figure above 50 indicates expansion.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders dwindled and factories suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The figures come ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets will be looking for a clear plan from the bank to deal with a stalled eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation standing at just 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB boss Mario Draghi could offer further indications later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone, similar to those taken by the UK and US during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers is becoming more visible," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.</seg>
<seg id="10">The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's biggest trade partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.</seg>
<seg id="12">France remains a real concern, as does Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Signs that growth impetus waned in the key industrial engine of Germany, and in Spain and the Netherlands too, is also less than reassuring," Mr Dobson said.</seg>
<seg id="14">The slowdown in industry is likely to add further fuel to the fire for analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="15">One positive note was from the Republic of Ireland, which saw its PMI grow to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said for the August eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' survey is that it indicates that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Eurozone manufacturers are clearly finding life very difficult at the moment as current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly related to Russia/Ukraine - add uncertainty to still challenging conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This heightened uncertainty has clearly hit business - especially, and consumer confidence, and it is likely causing some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, particularly big-ticket orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said it was looking "ever more likely" that the ECB would ultimately have to undertake some form of QE, "although we suspect that it will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Beslan survivors' decade of hell: Ten years since the horrific school siege, how the children caught up in it are still suffering</seg>
<seg id="2">Ten years ago over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia</seg>
<seg id="3">More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world</seg>
<seg id="4">We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly a decade after the appalling Beslan school siege in which 334 perished, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">When fanatic Islamic terrorists kidnapped and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the start of a new term, it seemed like the nadir of all evil.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tragedy united east and west in revulsion, which amazingly then turned to action and hope for the future in the direst misery.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ten years on, we went back to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity.</seg>
<seg id="9">We discovered amazing young people, who have defied adversity, though the memory of this terrorist hell will live with them forever.</seg>
<seg id="10">Their greatest hope?</seg>
<seg id="11">That the war now scarring Ukraine - in which children like them are dying - will now stop.</seg>
<seg id="12">The girl pictured trying to climb back inside the blitzed school gym</seg>
<seg id="13">She was famously snapped by top Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov wearing only her underwear as tried to climb back inside the blitzed school gym after a mine exploded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bewildered, Aida was desperately searching for her mother, Larissa, now 40.</seg>
<seg id="15">Both were feared dead, but in fact they survived.</seg>
<seg id="16">'A woman told me to run for my life but I couldn't,' said Aida at the time.</seg>
<seg id="17">My legs were covered in blood.</seg>
<seg id="18">I got up and climbed back in to look for my mum.</seg>
<seg id="19">A soldier plucked her to safety.</seg>
<seg id="20">After a series of surgeries, she thought she had totally recovered but said yesterday: 'Three months ago, the pain came back.</seg>
<seg id="21">I fear I may need more surgery.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some shrapnel pieces are still in my knee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Her aim now is to become a dentist, to help people as she has been aided by medics.</seg>
<seg id="24">'This tragedy changed my life but it surely did not break it,' she said defiantly.</seg>
<seg id="25">'It happened to me and you can't change this fact.</seg>
<seg id="26">Once a year I always go to the gym to recall those who remained there.</seg>
<seg id="27">My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.</seg>
<seg id="28">The pain is too much.</seg>
<seg id="29">My best friend and my classmate-to-be Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.</seg>
<seg id="30">We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together.</seg>

<seg id="32">I will think about a family later.</seg>
<seg id="33">She says the siege remains with her though memories fade a little each year.</seg>
<seg id="34">I am pleased that many people in the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in Britain and everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="35">When I see online the photograph of me climbing into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, understand about our disaster, and stop this from happening any more.</seg>
<seg id="36">The boy who fled through a hail of bullets believing his mother to be dead</seg>
<seg id="37">He was on his first day at school (Russians start school aged 7) and survived the three day siege hugging his mum Tamara.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then seven he said: 'Mummy told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.'</seg>
<seg id="39">After one explosion he thought she was dying.</seg>
<seg id="40">She told him: 'Run'.</seg>
<seg id="41">Fearing she was dead, he fled and on his way he saw a crying toddler, grabbed the child by the hand, and fled through a hail of bullets.</seg>
<seg id="42">His dad Vladimir, who scooped up his son outside, said: 'Damir told me his mother had died.</seg>
<seg id="43">He said: 'I couldn't save her'.'</seg>
<seg id="44">In fact, Tamara had stumbled free and was in hospital with leg wounds, in turn believing her son had perished.</seg>
<seg id="45">After their reunion she said: 'I wept with joy.</seg>
<seg id="46">I couldn't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="47">He ran in and hugged me.</seg>
<seg id="48">Damir was later flown to London (by the now defunct News of the World newspaper) to be crowned a Barnardo's Children's Champion by then premier Tony Blair and wife wife Cherie.</seg>
<seg id="49">'This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop recalling it,' he said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still I can say that in my mind it is fading.</seg>
<seg id="51">I remember right afterwards, I threw away all my toy guns.</seg>
<seg id="52">But now I can play computer games with shooting and it is not a problem for me.</seg>
<seg id="53">'I'm not scared to go back in the gym but I don't think about myself.</seg>
<seg id="54">I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard who never got out.</seg>
<seg id="55">We never say they were killed or dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say they stayed in the gym.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember my trip to London so well, specially the toy shop where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted, and riding in an open top car.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he fears for places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of misery he and his friends suffered.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop recalling it</seg>
<seg id="60">'I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,' said Damir, who was last week doing voluntary work at a nunnery.</seg>
<seg id="61">I want to help so much.</seg>
<seg id="62">I want to serve in the police one day and hope they enrol me to the training academy next year.</seg>
<seg id="63">His mother Tamara, 48, said: '37 kids were killed in our neighbourhood, can you imagine?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember terrible silence right after the siege, there were just no children to shout and run around, and that silence lasted for many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">She vividly recalls her trip with Damir to London.</seg>
<seg id="66">People in London were crying when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I realised then how folk on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, can show their support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was grateful to 'Cherie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I wish I could call Cherie and just say it myself that 10 years have gone but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember when Damir wanted to eat borsch soup, they called all the local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he was playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir was shooting at them from his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And we were just one month away from our horror then.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was amazed that the British people were so ready to share our pain and to support us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: 'I keep thinking this world did not get better within these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">Now in Ukraine the war goes on, people are dying every day, and I believe many children were killed and will be killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">They are just the same children, like ours.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bored or busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I just know what those people feel, the horror of it.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and it is so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became a very gentle and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not seeking revenge for example, he is not preoccupied with this past horror.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to recall it but he is very close with six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was smaller he suffered from it - I remember he used to lie down on the sofa with his face turned away from us, for hours at a time.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not sleeping, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw away all his guns and other army-type toys.Damir is 17 now, taller than me, nice looking, clever and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that for some hours I was so sure he was dead and I'd never see him again.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I managed to recover after the explosion and got on my feet I looked around, I saw the hell around me, when body parts were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that there was no way my little boy could have survived in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">'I remember I was shouting to him 'Damir, run, run away' but again I was so sure he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he did hear, and he did run away.</seg>
<seg id="92">So life goes on for us unlike for so many.</seg>
<seg id="93">Georgy Ilyin, 17</seg>
<seg id="94">The boy whose shocking image after the siege came to define the horror of Beslan</seg>
<seg id="95">Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mum Fatima after the siege in 2004, while on the right is Georgy today</seg>
<seg id="96">His bloodstained face was etched with fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates.</seg>
<seg id="97">His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity at Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, a senior GP, had dropped him for his first day at school before rushing to take her elder son Vladimir to university.</seg>
<seg id="99">'I left two minutes before the terrorists rushed into the yard, so my little boy was left there alone for three days of horror,' she recalled.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not completely alone, we had a family of relatives there but all of them were killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my Georgy managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is no single day when we do not recall this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not feel it was long ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes from those days come to my mind all the time.</seg>
<seg id="105">Nobody will ever forget, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Haunting: The image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and has been immortalised in a statue (right)</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember Georgy so much wanted to go to school on that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I only got to know he was alive when I saw him TV.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there is even a statue to crying Georgy in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">Georgy does not like to look at this picture and it is hidden it in the bookcase in our home.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand, but I also think that thanks to this picture people from all over the world feel our pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">Georgy says now: 'It's important this can never happen again.</seg>
<seg id="113">'I doubt we'll ever know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People keep investigating such tragedies and never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is moving to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">'I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no-one wants a war, so how does it happen?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years to pass in order to forget it a little.</seg>
<seg id="121">It affected my health and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege but then it got better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I got back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">This is why I keep going to the gym as each 1 September approaches.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is hard for me to go inside the gym but I must do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I do not feel myself a victim, this story is the part of my past now.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it but I do not feel sorry for myself.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I finished school this year entered a medical university in Vladikavkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I will learn to be a heart surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was to go in the army.</seg>
<seg id="134">I wanted to be a military man, but my health did not let me.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country but it will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="136">Georgy Farniyev, 20</seg>
<seg id="137">The boy who survived despite having been trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist</seg>
<seg id="138">Miraculous: Georgy Farniyev was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege but still managed to survive</seg>
<seg id="139">As the siege was underway, he was pictured trapped inside the gym, sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a murderous terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="140">It is truly a miracle he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">'We feel as if it was just yesterday,' said Georgy, who wanted to train as an intelligence officer in the FSB, but was unable to because of damage to his health in the siege.</seg>
<seg id="142">It is still with me, this is not something I left behind.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now and people use to say children easily cope with bad experience - I must say this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">'In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I did feel a bit better afterwards but I can't forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when I went inside the gym again.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I would never ever go there again and please don't ask me to show where I sat in that well-known picture.</seg>
<seg id="149">Survivor: Georgy Farniev pictured today, with a photograph of him in hospital follwoing the siege on his laptop</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I do not like to think or discuss it and they never asked me about the school.</seg>
<seg id="152">In terms of physical condition I am well.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful with my knee which was injured but I walk fine now.</seg>
<seg id="154">Still my health did not let me go and study in FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.</seg>
<seg id="155">I sent my documents, including medical papers, and they replied it was not possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have completed two years there.</seg>
<seg id="158">He is learning to treat all animals 'from cats to cows'.</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: 'I know I would never tell my children about my experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">This is not something children should know about, and of course not something they should experience.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother Marina, 42, said: 'This pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets close.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go and attend ceremonies being held to mark it.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know Georgy won't go.</seg>
<seg id="165">It must be even stronger for him because he was there and I was not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home, not able to help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me.Here in Beslan the imprint is on everyone.</seg>
<seg id="168">It stays with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Georgy is an adult now but that horror is still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is hard to accept it when something so terribly unfair happens to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he likes sports but he can't take part because of his knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several surgeries, he walks but cannot exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say he 50% overcame this horror, but one can never completely overcome and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This horrible experience will stay with us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege, and it only adds to my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost many people I knew well and they were dear for me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could do for me but my heart aches about those killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know families where new children were born, but also widows who never married again.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want it.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget my heart jumping out of my chest at the moment I saw him in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">Now I look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">What are those people fighting for?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why are they killing each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We used to be one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children are suffering, I am sure many children were already killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we could only grab all the rebels and throw them away - as far away as possible.</seg>
<seg id="188">Alyona Tskaeva, 10</seg>

<seg id="190">Saved: Alyona Tskaeva is carried to safety by a Russian special forces commando (left).</seg>
<seg id="191">She is now ten (right) and has no memory at all of the atrocity</seg>
<seg id="192">The world gasped in 2004 when baby Alyona was carried out of the Beslan siege cradled in the arms of a Russian policeman.</seg>
<seg id="193">Terrorists let her go but cruelly kept her 30 year old mother, ten year old older sister Kristina, and brother Makhar in the school gym.</seg>
<seg id="194">Makhar, then three, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.</seg>
<seg id="195">Her father Ruslan has since remarried and with his new wife Svetlana he has a baby girl, who he named Kristina after the daughter he lost.</seg>
<seg id="196">Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the siege and has blossomed into a bright and happy girl, say neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="197">'They are a big happy family now and Alyona and Makhar are both great kids,' said a close friend.</seg>
<seg id="198">Ruslan is a fantastic dad and wants to get them away from all the memories as the tenth anniversary is marked.</seg>
<seg id="199">You can understand why.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips for better underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you're interested in shooting photos or video underwater, you have a variety of equipment choices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both go for around $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I shot these photos at a family party using several cameras, all priced under $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what gear you use, a few rules apply for getting the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Double-check your gear.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera's battery and other compartments are tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Also, set your camera to match the type of photos or video you'll be shooting.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders have scene or shooting modes that will optimize the exposure for dim undersea settings.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in, know how deep your equipment can go.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are rated to only 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Check out our buying guide and Ratings for digital cameras for both conventional and waterproof models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Take multiple shots - because many of them won't work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point-and-shoot cameras have LCDs to help you compose photos, while action cams generally don't.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have an LCD, it's going to hard to see it underwater, and composing your shot will be a hit-or-miss process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So shoot multiples.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera has a bracket mode, which shoots a burst of shots at slightly different exposure settings, take advantage of it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay near the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">Light falls off dramatically the deeper you dive underwater.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay close to the surface when you shoot in a pool, a lake or the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">This will also allow you to capture more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you'll see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Get close to your subjects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is great advice for shooting on dry land, but it is even more important underwater because of the dim lighting conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's particularly important if you're shooting with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed, wide angle lens, which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the picture frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose force of personality could shake things up, even in a gargantuan organisation like the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">A consultant anaesthetist, he devoted his career to sparing the sick both the agonies of illness and the torments of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who sought him out, his wife remembers, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the crippling after-effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson understood that while doctors are captivated by diagnoses and diseases, those being treated are overwhelmingly concerned with something else entirely: pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have not felt myself," he wrote in May that year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I've had difficulty in energising myself.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found himself impatiently berating his wife, Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want everything to happen sooner rather than later," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet went away on business for a week, Lawson found himself unusually, and unaccountably, upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was up.</seg>
<seg id="12">He got a colleague to perform a chest X-ray.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks earlier he had been skiing in the French Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the X-ray came back.</seg>
<seg id="15">He had mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lining of the lung.</seg>
<seg id="16">With most cancers, it is hard to know the exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Though some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer sufferers have smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But mesothelioma is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost every case, the cause is exposure to asbestos - a fibrous building material once dubbed "miraculous," but now known to be mortally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us, mesothelioma has been an easy disease to ignore.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, after all, is a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when a voluntary industry ban came into effect.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it was used, only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pipe laggers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">An industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such complacency is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is today at the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more mesothelioma deaths here than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">With an annual toll of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die of the disease as die in accidents in motor vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mesothelioma annual deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason that we are feeling its deadly effects now is that, though asbestos use has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), it usually takes decades for mesothelioma to develop.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the mesothelioma scourge is not confined to veterans of industrial building jobs.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, embedded in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we are educated in, and the stores we shop in.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma is no respecter of class, wealth, occupation, or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The bastions of privilege, from smart London department stores to public schools, have proved no refuge.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Houses of Parliament are riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even the hospitals that are meant to make us better have been reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nor was he a pipe lagger.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he struggled to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he put his finger on it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital where I spent six years training," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">Everybody - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used the tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question to which, sadly, he was able to provide a partial answer.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of four doctors who trained at Guy's Hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one left alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us will get this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died, on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">To survive so long is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty per cent of mesothelioma sufferers are dead 8 months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So now we can only echo Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, our best guess is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should have played itself out, some 90,000 people will have died.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most currently have no idea that they will die this way.</seg>
<seg id="55">An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick glance at the reports from the courts, where those affected often turn for compensation, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma has spread.</seg>
<seg id="57">This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, supervising clothes sections at two sites - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Allen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now she has two children in their 20s.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never would have dreamed that I would be affected by it.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people do know much about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos describes not one substance but a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "asbestiform" - which describes the fibrous structure which endows them with strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of the six, three have commonly been used in the building trade.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, commonly known as White Asbestos, is by far the most frequently found in buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was used in roofing panels, floor tiles, pipe insulation, boiler seals, even brake linings in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but it's still considered a "major health hazard" that can kill by the EU and WHO.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, are Brown Asbestos (amosite) and Blue Asbestos (crocidolite).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of Brown Asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major cause of the uniquely high mesothelioma rate [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">A Marks & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at its flagship store in Oxford Street, London Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice Allen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is far from uncommon.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has produced a study of sufferers which suggests that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas with no known occupational or domestic exposure were probably caused by environmental asbestos exposure."</seg>
<seg id="75">Much of that exposure, he says, is due to "normal occupation and weathering" of our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can be sure that they are safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report from Goddard Consulting, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of government, might have been exposed unawares.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009 Goddard reported that service shafts and piping ducts behind Parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be disturbed by something as innocuous as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">MPs are frequently accused of looking after their own interests, but in this case it seems the opposite may have been true.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the Parliamentary Works Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had been given "a clean bill of health," it is now accepted £1bn of work lasting several years is required to overhaul Parliament, upgrading electrics and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election MPs may sit in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than on the Green Benches at Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard report noted that "the presence of asbestos has not been managed in accordance with the various regulations."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know if this mismanagement will cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All anyone can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One person who has never been able to pinpoint his exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a GP.</seg>
<seg id="85">Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I have worked at a hospital where positive asbestos claims have been made," he says, "But I can't prove it in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places one has worked in, and the dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">What he remembers clearly is the day early in December in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a fever.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and in the middle of a late evening surgery.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I started feeling shivery.</seg>
<seg id="91">It came on very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt dreadful.</seg>
<seg id="93">I didn't think I was going to be able to drive all the way home.</seg>
<seg id="94">Being a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the pleura, the lining around his lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">But like Janice Allen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="96">He ended up spending a month off work.</seg>
<seg id="97">Puzzled doctors gave him chest X-rays, and administered pleural catheters to draw off fluid from the lungs and send it for assessment.</seg>
<seg id="98">Yet the condition went undiagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="99">Slowly his health improved and he went back to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he took exercise and was breathing hard.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of Abbott's patients arrived at his GP's surgery with similar symptoms to him, and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then Abbott didn't make the connection with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">After all, his patient was decades older, and had worked directly asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The link in that case was clear.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his consultant took his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started feeling unwell, a probe, equipped with a camera, was fed into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I tend just to plod along," he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">I hadn't worried about it too much to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, was worrying.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly Abbott was plunged into meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he should get in touch with a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">That was when he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos was widely used, particularly in big public buildings which quite often had asbestos lagging on the pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who were exposed to asbestos in those buildings are now coming down with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">So mesothelioma is now affecting younger people not in the typical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous asbestos-lagged pipes in hospitals were below ground level, so patients are unlikely to have been affected.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many staff, walking in pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or eating in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott frequently did) almost certainly did come into contact with the toxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were potentially life-saving places for patients, but life-threatening places for the doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It is still being removed today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Pupils perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats</seg>
<seg id="123">And it is not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was frequently used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls for its marvellous insulating and flame-retarding properties.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact many people will have been first exposed to asbestos in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Up and down the country, in myriad chemistry lessons, pupils have perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="128">Websites have sprung up to address the issue of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, items as innocuous as floor tiles or shed roofs have routinely contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It's an industrial poison built into large amounts of our housing stock," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his case against Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case the only contact the woman sufferer could think of was pulling down a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful how you pull down the garden shed.</seg>
<seg id="133">The impact of diagnosis, knowing that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"It takes a while to sink in," says Graham Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to carry on but realised that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I was at the surgery for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realised that I would have to leave and sort myself out.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I won't see Christmas again</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the hardest things was moving from the position of doctor to that of patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling bewildered by the amount of information to get to grips with.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was hard to take everything in," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my consultant "How long do I have?"</seg>
<seg id="143">I was quoted about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember thinking "Well, I won't see Christmas again.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's it.""</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly pernicious, because it is the mechanics of how we stay alive - the very act of breathing - that causes the cancer that kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most Mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is made up of tiny fibres.</seg>
<seg id="149">When the asbestos is disturbed and the fibres are inhaled, they can become embedded in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibres irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem comes from inhaled needle-shaped fibres of asbestos," Professor Tom Treasure, a cardio-thoracic surgeon who moved in 2001 to Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="152">The very hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading centre in treating mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson, and treated some others who are likely to have been exposed while training at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">Once the asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, "the act of breathing pushes them on the periphery, which is where the lining is.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is by its nature invasive from the very beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">The normal options for treating other forms of cancer work less well with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some feel it is worth trying.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't excise the pleura," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">You can't get your knife round it.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile the cancer "is not very responsive to chemotherapy," which "has an effect" but does not cure.</seg>
<seg id="163">"Every now and again you get long survivors," says Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Happily, some patients do live far, far beyond expectations.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two-and-a-half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still battling on.</seg>
<seg id="168">After contacting mesothelioma Abbott was put in touch with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and advice bureau for fellow sufferers.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Hello, Cancer Central," he would announce cheerily when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="171">He had been diagnosed 4 years before and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Initially, Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months, and likely prolong his life by just one month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I felt desperate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I felt like giving up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, "managed to put a slightly better tint on things."</seg>
<seg id="176">After seeing several consultants, Abbott decided to pursue his treatment with Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski, professor in thoracic surgery at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I didn't have to be referred, I just rang them up and they saw me," Graham admits.</seg>
<seg id="178">The average patient would have to get a referral and have funding approved.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is crucial for those with mesothelioma to pursue the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when those treatments eventually, inevitably, fail, many sufferers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they turn to the courts in pursuit of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is noxious to health since 1898," says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what changed in the 1960s is that it was realised that even very low levels could be a risk to health.</seg>
<seg id="185">That is where company negligence came in.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full-value settlement" since Lawson could not prove definitively that his mesothelioma was down to asbestos exposure at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the inquest into his death, a spokesman for Guy's did confirm, however, that "the asbestos in the basement area concerned was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">That was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, pinning lethal asbestos exposure on one company or place of work - usually decades after the fact - has proved a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have changed hands or gone out of business.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance records may have been lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side, which the claimants certainly do not.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year has seen major new legislation which makes it easier for those with mesothelioma to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be traced.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law has created a £350m pot of money, funded by the insurance industry, for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases sufferers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court might have awarded in a normal compensation case - about £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims to the scheme are expected each year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many involved with mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350m represents "a very good job" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers" he says, suggesting that the sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the passage of time had not intervened, and mesothelioma sufferers were able to track down companies and sue them in the normal way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Penning, then Works and Pensions minister, admitted that the law was "not perfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning and Morgan admit that, with seven victims dying each day, quick action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People are suffering so much, and need help today," said Penning during the Mesothelioma Bill's second reading in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After their initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski advised surgery which, in contrast to Tom Treasure, he believes has a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a tri-therapy for which Lang-Lazdunski can boast five year survival rates as high as 40 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt empowered.</seg>
<seg id="207">"That of course is one of the most important things," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see it in patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is some drive that keeps you going.</seg>
<seg id="210">When you give up you can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott went in for surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he had completed the last of his six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">Follow-up scans revealed no sign of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had my scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There was multiple spotting [of cancer] around my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I was just about to turn 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">It's not life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">It's life ending.</seg>
<seg id="219">Once again Abbott put himself through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no sign of the tumours.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is both physically and emotionally gruelling.</seg>
<seg id="222">You have to think about practical things - about the finances when I'm gone for example, or showing my wife how the boiler timer works.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news you start getting negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">You have to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It's hard as a parent," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is difficult to know what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I was first diagnosed I told the girls that I had a condition that meant I wasn't going to become old.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is very sociable and boisterous.</seg>
<seg id="231">She told her friends and we got lots of calls very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more reserved.</seg>
<seg id="233">She didn't say much.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such conversations are something that all cancer patients must face.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for mesothelioma sufferers such discussions are not leavened by hope, by even a glimmer of a possibility of survival.</seg>
<seg id="236">The disease carries with it (even as it did, eventually, for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.</seg>
<seg id="237">As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="238">Bodies of embalmed Pharaohs wrapped in asbestos cloths.</seg>

<seg id="241">A linen has now been invented that is incombustible.</seg>
<seg id="242">I have seen napkins made of it glowing on the hearths at banquets</seg>
<seg id="243">Modern commercial asbestos use begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even bank notes) and cloth.</seg>
<seg id="244">Major asbestos mines open in Canada and South Africa, and soon after in America, Itlay and Russia.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong right to choose leaders; protesters vow vengeance</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday against letting Hong Kong voters nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing agitation for democratic reform.</seg>
<seg id="3">The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision by China's National People's Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to weed out any candidates not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not unexpected, but it is still infuriating," said legislator Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not what Beijing promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They've lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it's clear we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending China's ruling, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said allowing public nominations in the election for Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing had promised to allow the region's residents to vote for the chief executive beginning in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese leaders presented the Sunday ruling as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kongers a direct vote, but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders would retain a firm hold on the process through a nominating committee tightly controlled by Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new clause, only candidates who "love the country, and love Hong Kong" would be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ruling comes after a summer that has featured some of the largest and most high-profile protests in Hong Kong in years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not grant authentic universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday night, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had assembled in the rain outside the Hong Kong government's headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the demonstration, organizers said that their movement was entering a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would mount waves of protests in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, they did not give details, apparently looking to avoid problems with authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In an online statement, organizers said the movement "has considered occupying Central only as the last resort, an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are very sorry to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of Central will definitely happen.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security was tight Sunday at the government headquarters, with police and barricades deployed.</seg>
<seg id="21">Driving the unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">An influx of mainlanders is fueling competition for products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to bend under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong - at risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest they are talking about, it could result in much economic damage, depending on how many are involved and for how long," said legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want concern to spread that Hong Kong is getting out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is a perception that is bad for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">China's state-run media also has run stories in recent days painting Hong Kong's democracy activists as agents of subversion directed by Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights that drew 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in July, tens of thousands turned out for one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pre-election propaganda?</seg>
<seg id="2">A League in Jihlava carries its name under a political movement.</seg>
<seg id="3">Minor-league soccer is played in Vysočiny's regional capital by approximately 1,600 amateur athletes.</seg>
<seg id="4">And their biggest competition is newly called the Together for Jihlava League.</seg>
<seg id="5">The name is that of a political movement that is taking part in the October municipal elections.</seg>
<seg id="6">Its tenth candidate is the head of the minor-league soccer team in Jihlava, Jan Mráka.</seg>
<seg id="7">"A plenary session was held, at which no one had a problem with the idea," Mráka explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">The situation surrounding the first minor-league soccer team has already been addressed by lawyers for the Jihlava City Hall, and they have recommended changing the system of dividing grants.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, around CZK 1 million was allocated for minor-league soccer by the city, according to its website.</seg>
<seg id="10">This year too, it will receive hundreds of thousands.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the expressed legal opinion, the approach by the minor-league soccer team neither conflicts with the law nor with the City Hall's directives.</seg>
<seg id="12">"However, the situation gives the relevant authority a reason to change the rules for allocation of grants and subsidies," explained City Hall spokesman Radek Tulis.</seg>
<seg id="13">Drawing grants from the city and at the same time expressing support for a single political party in the elections as the minor-league soccer team is probably not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="14">No similar request has yet been addressed to major-league soccer in Vysočiny by politicians.</seg>
<seg id="15">Suppose, for example, that a Social Democratic Party regional championship, a Civic Democratic Party division or a Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party 1.</seg>
<seg id="16">A category or similar competitive events were created.</seg>
<seg id="17">I would not be in favor of it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead, I would be glad if sponsors from a number of companies contacted us," said Regional Soccer Association Chairman Miroslav Vrzáček.</seg>
<seg id="19">The head of minor-league soccer will not allow other parties or movements into the league's name.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to minor-league soccer players, this sport in Jihlava deserves its own site with six fields, locker rooms and restrooms.</seg>
<seg id="21">"For example, the Na Stoupách field is not ours, we are renting it," pointed out Ondřej Lapeš from Starlet Jihlava.</seg>
<seg id="22">Český mlýn would probably be the best location.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, I believe that in that location a ridiculous site for skateboarders is going to be built there, and Jihlava already has about 50 of them," Mráka said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Jihlava Mayor Jaroslav Vymazal (Civic Democratic Party) has reacted by noting that the minor-league soccer team uses a field with artificial turf on Rošického a Na Stoupách Streets, which are owned by the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"We want to build a field that will have maximum use.</seg>
<seg id="26">We are planning modernization or development of sports stadiums near schools, which will be accessible during afternoon hours.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think major progress has been made in recent years for minor-league soccer," Vymazal added.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to Jan Mráka, no other political parties will appear in the names of leagues.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We have limits.</seg>
<seg id="30">If anyone from one field enters into a partnership with us, we no longer admit another one," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"A political movement in the name of a league is something that I consider at least unfortunate," said Karel Voldán, a member of the City Council's commission for sports.</seg>
<seg id="32">"But let players decide whether Mr. Mráka is using Jihlava's minor-league soccer association and grants from the city for political purposes or not," he added.</seg>

<seg id="2">We're excited to be answering this demand by launching the UK's first luxurious travel service for the students of today.</seg>
<seg id="3">To make the maximum impact arriving at university, the company also offers transport options including private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Stewart also claimed the service had a safety aspect.</seg>
<seg id="5">The service is an ideal alternative for students who would usually have to haul their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.</seg>
<seg id="6">Paired with our new VIF options, we're looking forward to ensuring this year students reach university with minimum fuss and maximum luxury.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesman for the company said that because the service has just launched there have been no bookings yet but added that "students will be booking the service over the next few weeks."</seg>
<seg id="8">The company also said that despite students facing tuition fees of £9,000 a year, it still expected to find a market for the service.</seg>
<seg id="9">Students of today are quite different in terms of expectations and aspirations, compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression and VIF is just the way to do that.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the National Union of Students criticised the service as out of touch.</seg>
<seg id="11">Megan Dunn, NUS vice president for higher education, said: "This scheme seems incredibly out of touch with the lives of the majority of students.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many students starting university this month are facing a cost of living crisis, with available financial support in loans and grants failing to keep pace with spiralling bills for basic essentials, before they can even start thinking about forking out thousands of pounds for something as simple arriving at their halls of residence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists take on race and police conduct post-Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Attendees hold their hands up while chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," as they wait in line before the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo. over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, white feminist commenters prioritized gender above race when it came to pushing forward reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">But as tensions rose in the Midwest and drew nationwide coverage, Perez saw responses from white women that centered 100 percent around race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared to the responses of black women soon after the shooting on August 9, the personal essays with titles like "thoughts on ferguson as a white woman" and "Feminism Is Not Just About Women's Oppression" came relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But to Perez, it demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think you get a lot of people talking about whiteness and privilege in such a high level way," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People felt called to voice something about what happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's very emblematic of the crisis we face and because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racialized, they have to call that out.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light issues that black American women face every day but that aren't seen as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can post something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and it will get 150 likes from all over the place," said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">"How is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere?" she asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues regarding race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">To her, black women have not had the luxury of neatly separating the issues; they live the combined reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women are now combining issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist spheres, Angela Hattery, women and gender studies professor at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">You needed the white woman to be complicit in the narrative to justify the lynching.</seg>
<seg id="21">To Hattery, the breakdown between white and black women came when white suffragists like Susan B. Anthony surveyed the landscape in the late 1800s and saw that the fight for voting rights would only work for one group at a time: women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They made the decision to put their eggs in the basket for votes for women and votes for Blacks would come later," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="23">To look back at things like that gives us a powerful perspective on why women of color don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We haven't done a good job.</seg>
<seg id="25">We haven't helped black women protect their husbands and sons ever.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to organize against lynching as the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group came nearly 40 years after black women originally asked for assistance, said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">To Mitchell, the upswell of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police conduct, racial discrimination - reflect the times white feminists have had to play "catch up" to issues black women have grappled with for generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have those [traditional feminist] platforms took as seriously the right to raise a child as they did their right to have birth control?" posed Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">Second wave feminists who made careers out of fighting for reproductive rights and access to birth control are now figuring out what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">Noted white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's shooting to post a pointed column by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll that demanded more protest from white Americans on the issue of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope women, who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger that is located in the body - and racial opinions that are measurably different in public polls - will lead the change," Steinem wrote.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem has vouched for a more intersectional feminism that includes issues of race as well as gender, her comments on race in America still puzzle some.</seg>
<seg id="34">American Enterprise Institute scholar Christina Sommers, author of "Who Stole Feminism?," told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson counter the criticism she has launched in the past.</seg>
<seg id="35">We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House recently initiated a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable black and Hispanic young men, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">Police relations with the black community is not the only issue pushing to the forefront of mainstream feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After U.S. border patrol apprehended nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, immigration reform surfaced once again - this time as a women's issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform, said that in order to rebrand the issue as essential for women, all she needed to do was share immigrant women's stories.</seg>
<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the vast majority of employment visas are given to [male immigrants], the women who come with them are left in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">A picture for a house for sale in Suffolk was removed by estate agents when it emerged it showed a large pig at rest in the living room.</seg>
<seg id="3">On sale for £120,000, the detached one-bedroom property sits on a private road in Ipswich.</seg>
<seg id="4">The particulars featured a picture of the living room of the house - which included a pig with its head resting on a settee.</seg>
<seg id="5">Estate agents Connells said the pig in the photo was the home owner's pet.</seg>
<seg id="6">"However, the photo was put up in error and has since been removed," a spokeswoman for the company said.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the particulars for the property, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique one bedroom detached house."</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the agency has removed the image from its website, it still appears in publicity material.</seg>

<seg id="2">Therefore, he finished at the Barum Rally.</seg>
<seg id="3">What exactly happened?</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a material defect.</seg>
<seg id="5">The car was brand new, so it didn't occur to me that something like that could happen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Couldn't the exhaust pipe be repaired temporarily to enable the car to be driven at a slower pace to a service center, where mechanics would replace it?</seg>
<seg id="7">If we had headed right there, then yes.</seg>
<seg id="8">But another two special stages awaited us, so it was impossible.</seg>
<seg id="9">There's a high temperature in it and there was a great risk that the car could catch on fire.</seg>
<seg id="10">I cannot allow that to happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">At full pace, you managed five speed tests.</seg>
<seg id="12">What was your impression from them?</seg>
<seg id="13">It was very good.</seg>
<seg id="14">I felt like when I was younger.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were fast, but I didn't go through with it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Everything was caused by the fact that we worked on the car for more than half a year to get it to a certain level.</seg>
<seg id="17">The race showed that we managed it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Did you get so into it that you couldn't really imagine victory?</seg>
<seg id="19">I prepared myself and the car so that we would really be in reach of victory.</seg>
<seg id="20">Our work didn't result in nothing.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, we didn't get the outcome that we had expected.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that's the Barum Rally.</seg>
<seg id="23">Technology unfortunately said no.</seg>
<seg id="24">You were not the only one from the top who got out of the race for first place early.</seg>
<seg id="25">Foreign favorites such as Breen, Abbring and Lappi did too.</seg>
<seg id="26">Were you surprised that so many favorites withdrew?</seg>
<seg id="27">Yes.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mainly for spectators, it was a pity, because it caused the race to end early.</seg>
<seg id="29">Jaromír Tarabus, for you are preparing a car, was also at the top for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="30">But he paid the price of veering from the route and suffered a loss of nearly two minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">How satisfied were you with his performance?</seg>
<seg id="32">It's a pity, because he could have repeated the winners' levels.</seg>
<seg id="33">After all, he drove the first two times.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even Mira confirmed to me that we had prepared the car well.</seg>
<seg id="35">He went very fast.</seg>
<seg id="36">Exactly a year ago, you announced the end of your career, but you still showed up at the start of the Barum Rally.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could your good feeling from this event make you a regular participant in rally races?</seg>
<seg id="38">Certainly not at this time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Last year, I said that the Barum would be my last race, and I still didn't keep the promise.</seg>
<seg id="40">I decided to race again.</seg>
<seg id="41">It was my nineteenth start here, and if there's a chance in a year from now, then I will take it.</seg>
<seg id="42">But I'm not considering anything after that.</seg>
<seg id="43">A lot of people came to the track just because of you.</seg>
<seg id="44">Did it make you happy??</seg>
<seg id="45">To a certain extent, we started because of them.</seg>
<seg id="46">A lot of people, people who I know and don't know, constantly asked if I would race.</seg>
<seg id="47">I wanted to make them happy.</seg>
<seg id="48">What awaits you after the Barum?</seg>
<seg id="49">The team will press on.</seg>
<seg id="50">Next week we are going to Vyškova, where Robert Adolf will race.</seg>
<seg id="51">I hope he hasn't damaged the car very much here.</seg>
<seg id="52">Furthermore, for this race sometimes he wants to borrow the Fabia from Honza Sýkora.</seg>
<seg id="53">With Mira, we will participate in European double races in Switzerland and Corsica.</seg>
<seg id="54">For that, we will have to prepare some things for next year.</seg>
<seg id="55">Can you already indicate anything?</seg>

<seg id="1">A verbal agreement with an employer can be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="2">Unfortunately, you have not yet had your physician issue a confirmation of your work disability, which serves as evidence for an organization that for health reasons you cannot carry out your work duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, you did not immediately notify your employer of the absence.</seg>
<seg id="4">Subsequently, although you reached an agreement that the particular days would be recorded as vacation, the agreement was made only verbally.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the Labor Office does not require an employee to have the employer's permission to take leave confirmed in writing, in practice this approach has proven effective.</seg>
<seg id="6">If there is only a verbal agreement, then you won't have a confirmation of it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Later, the supposed consent with drawing leave, like in your case, can be denied, and your absence from work can be evaluated as a long-term inexcusable absence and a reason for immediate termination of employment under Section 53 of the Labor Code.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then if there is a court dispute about the agreement with the employer, you will lack provable evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, employment with you has not been canceled pursuant to Section 53, you only have the particular days specified in your records as an inexcusable absence.</seg>
<seg id="10">An inexcusable absence in your records will not have the same consequences as Section 53 (such as the inability to collect unemployment benefits), even though it hinders your ability to seek new employment.</seg>
<seg id="11">When recommend that you visit the particular doctor again and have the doctor issue written confirmation that an injury actually occurred, which made you unable to work (not a "sickness confirmation", but only a document from the physician).</seg>
<seg id="12">When looking for new employment, you can submit the specified document and explain the situation.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is a good idea not to underestimate either issuance of a physician's written confirmation of work disability or prompt notification of an employer or requesting written permission for drawing leave.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tony Stewart's return to the track has ended only a little over halfway through his race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tire blew out on lap 172, ending his night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Stewart drove his battered car to the garage and then exited without speaking to reporters.</seg>
<seg id="5">His crew chief Chad Johnston said the 14 team was disappointed, but will now start focusing on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I wish we could have had a better effort and a better finish for him," Johnston said.</seg>
<seg id="7">We'll go on to Richmond and hope we can do better there.</seg>
<seg id="8">Stewart first went into the wall earlier in Sunday night's race following a collision with Kyle Busch, requiring work to the right side of his car.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I went into today with some pretty good hopes of finishing well," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."</seg>
<seg id="10">Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded onto the hauler and the team was packed up and ready to leave.</seg>
<seg id="11">Stewart skipped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car struck and killed a fellow driver in a dirt-track race in upstate New York.</seg>
<seg id="12">He decided to return this week, needing to win either at Atlanta or the next race at Richmond to claim a spot in the Chase.</seg>
<seg id="13">He returned to work as an investigation into the tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the track to confront Stewart during a race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Authorities said Friday that the probe into the cause of the crash will last at least another two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="15">No decision has been made about whether Stewart will face charges.</seg>
<seg id="16">The three-time champion received a big cheer when he was introduced before the race.</seg>
<seg id="17">Starting in the 12th spot, Stewart ran in the top 10 early in the race, getting as high as fourth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Then, on lap 122 after a restart, Busch's No.</seg>
<seg id="19">18 machine got loose coming out of turn 2 and banged into Stewart, sending both cars against the wall.</seg>

<seg id="3">For 103 taxi parking locations, it will earn approximately CZK 12.3 million per year.</seg>
<seg id="4">Until recently, it had been collecting CZK 150,000 for the same taxi stands.</seg>

<seg id="9">The amount of the offer is currently decisive.</seg>
<seg id="10">"A year since the termination of the original contract and the start of the tender, it became apparent that the new system of leasing would be much more beneficial for Prague and entirely fair," the council member said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The most expensive spot is on Na Perštýně Street.</seg>
<seg id="12">The highest price has been offered by those interested in taxi stands on Na Perštýně Street.</seg>
<seg id="13">They will pay CZK 2.1 million per year.</seg>
<seg id="14">The new administrators paid approximately CZK 1.5 million for locations such as in front of the Municipal House and on Wenceslas Square.</seg>
<seg id="15">The new rules for leasing taxi stands were adopted by council members in the autumn of 2012, and last summer they terminated the original lease agreements.</seg>

<seg id="1">We had to clean the well for the second time this year already.</seg>
<seg id="2">Each time, we completely emptied it, which practically created a second pond around the cottage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Then we poured Savo into it.</seg>
<seg id="4">What an incredible stench!</seg>
<seg id="5">Our well in the basement always had plenty of fragrant water.</seg>
<seg id="6">And it was not done professionally in who knows what way, but grandpa dug it one his own.</seg>
<seg id="7">A long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was just three rings and generally peculiar, just like everything else at the cottage, but as I say.</seg>
<seg id="9">The water was great.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until this year.</seg>
<seg id="11">When we began the season, of course we pumped the water out.</seg>
<seg id="12">It deserved to be pumped out, since it had been sitting for several months.</seg>
<seg id="13">But even afterwards it seemed that the water somehow didn't smell good.</seg>
<seg id="14">It occurred to us that something might have fallen in.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the place where the pump went through, with a bit of bad luck it was possible, as a slab there was not entirely secluded, and the opening was sealed with a piece of brick.</seg>
<seg id="16">Our inspection confirmed that the brick had moved.</seg>
<seg id="17">Otherwise, nothing was visible in the water, and we shined all the way to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="18">So we emptied and cleaned it again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, we improved the improvised sealing around the pump pipe.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, in the basement we noticed some strange things.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the ground there was a package with some small cubes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Or at least that's how they looked.</seg>
<seg id="23">And there were more a little further away.</seg>
<seg id="24">Now it looked like a slimy mouse.</seg>
<seg id="25">By the ceiling, in locations where there were through vents, grandpa's discovery was found: pieces of fish!</seg>
<seg id="26">And heavily eaten!</seg>
<seg id="27">Our cellar is also strange.</seg>
<seg id="28">Someone could say that grandpa in short dug under the cottage.</seg>
<seg id="29">And that would not be far from the truth.</seg>
<seg id="30">The walls and the floor are only compacted sand, and only the ceiling is wooden.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mainly boats are placed there.</seg>
<seg id="32">And bicycles.</seg>
<seg id="33">And beach chairs.</seg>
<seg id="34">The gate with wide gaps has usually been open, and someone always has been able to get through it.</seg>
<seg id="35">By the ceiling there are already several of the mentioned vents.</seg>
<seg id="36">Without a net, so birds regularly fly in and build their nests there.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's needless to mention mice.</seg>
<seg id="38">Grandpa wanted to ventilate, but it wasn't going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="39">Now of course, even air did not help.</seg>
<seg id="40">The entire basement stank.</seg>
<seg id="41">So we cleaned the entire basement.</seg>
<seg id="42">That fish on the beam was especially nutritious!</seg>
<seg id="43">We also threw away items that were nearby: boards, a heraclithic slab and more.</seg>
<seg id="44">Our cottage welcomed passersby from afar with a disinfectant odor.</seg>
<seg id="45">We thought about who could have brought those awful things in.</seg>
<seg id="46">The nearest cat lives two kilometers way in a village.</seg>
<seg id="47">It would have had a hard time coming to our cottage for a snack.</seg>
<seg id="48">Grandpa thought it might have been one neighbor, who is not entirely in good condition.</seg>
<seg id="49">He wondered whether it was Franta and if he had pushed the disgusting things through a vent.</seg>
<seg id="50">It's been here practically all year, what stupid ideas he has.</seg>
<seg id="51">We decided to monitor and regularly check the basement and the well.</seg>
<seg id="52">After a few days, everything was fine.</seg>
<seg id="53">We began using the water again, so far only for washing and cleaning, until the tests were ready to let us know that it was fine again.</seg>
<seg id="54">Hauling water from a well in the forest is not something I would like to do for long.</seg>
<seg id="55">Once we heard the frightening bark of our female dog.</seg>
<seg id="56">Mom peered from the balcony and saw a long thick black hose in the grass next to the veranda.</seg>
<seg id="57">Réza jumped over it and howled like crazy.</seg>
<seg id="58">Mom scolded her, because she thought that Réza had dug up the waste hose from the sink.</seg>
<seg id="59">But suddenly the hose was partially rolled up into a ball and partially straightened.</seg>
<seg id="60">Then a hiss came from the balcony.</seg>
<seg id="61">Réza became hysterical.</seg>
<seg id="62">We ran down.</seg>
<seg id="63">A grass snake, which was more than a meter long and as thick as a whip was planning to swallow a large toad, and Réza stopped it from doing so.</seg>
<seg id="64">It was not clear whether she wanted to save the toad or if she herself wanted to eat it, but that's not what was important.</seg>
<seg id="65">When the grass snake saw that it was outnumbered by our entire family, it must have figured we wanted to eat it, since we were so hungry, and it then elegantly crept into the vent leading to the basement.</seg>
<seg id="66">We ran after it.</seg>
<seg id="67">It jumped out of the well like lightning.</seg>
<seg id="68">Then we noticed that there was another stinking package on the board.</seg>
<seg id="69">From the smell, it must have been a fish.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was not there the day before yesterday!</seg>
<seg id="71">Our new reinforcement around the pump was a little crooked.</seg>
<seg id="72">And we locked the basement even during the day.</seg>
<seg id="73">Is it possible that...</seg>
<seg id="74">We rushed outside, and each of us approached one vent.</seg>
<seg id="75">We didn't wait long.</seg>
<seg id="76">Something was stirring in the well.</seg>
<seg id="77">First a small flat head with yellow marigolds on its neck appeared.</seg>
<seg id="78">Then the entire grass snake leaped from the well.</seg>
<seg id="79">It moved around the pump and started going inside.</seg>

<seg id="2">A disgruntled employee bought computers for the company where he worked and then sold them after being fired.</seg>
<seg id="3">He managed to spend the money he made before the police arrested him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Over a short period in twelve instances the man bought a total of 16 computers for more than CZK 200,000.</seg>
<seg id="5">"After receiving the laptops, he took them to Olomouc, where he sold them to pawn shops," šumperské Police Commissioner Rostislav Brückner said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The employee was motivated by a desire to get revenge for being fired and to make money.</seg>
<seg id="7">"During questioning he told us that he had used the money for loan repayments," Brückner said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The police also discovered that the con-artist was a pathological gambler who had repeatedly received psychiatric treatment.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, the money could have ended up in game machines or video lottery terminals.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's a fact that we did not find any money on him," the commissioner said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Come a little closer you can manage it, or how I enjoyed We Run Prague</seg>
<seg id="2">This year the organizers have prepared a few changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The biggest is the change of route, which has moved the finish to the river bank, instead of going back to the Yellow Spa.</seg>
<seg id="4">I have looked forward to the race together with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I tried to enjoy it a little from the other side.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everyone of us on the team decided to say hello to your readers in person at a stand, where we took photos and filmed videos.</seg>
<seg id="6">In order to perfect view from the other side, I accepted the role of personal guide.</seg>
<seg id="7">Together with my friend Káťou, we humbly lined up at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.</seg>
<seg id="8">We said hello to our friends, who were walking around us to the sector for faster runners.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was not much time left.</seg>
<seg id="10">A couple of jumps to warm up, switching on sport testers, countdown and start!</seg>
<seg id="11">Cries of jubilation, but instead of the quick start it was followed by rushing to the starting line.</seg>
<seg id="12">After five minutes, we reach the gate, switch on our meters and run with a pace for the tenth hour.</seg>
<seg id="13">We become interwoven with the yellow stretch of runners, who like Káťou are running their first race.</seg>
<seg id="14">So far everyone looks refreshed, and the gradually setting sun on the horizon provides a view of Vyšehrad that nearly takes everyone's breath away.</seg>
<seg id="15">The pulsing mass running along the river bank makes it look like all of Prague is running.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the bank between Vyšehrad and the National Theater, as usual, it becomes apparent who has how much strength.</seg>
<seg id="17">The slight hill on Palackého Square forces many runners to slow down or switch to walking.</seg>
<seg id="18">Just before entering Divadelní Street, I see the police accompaniment, and behind them Vítek Pavlišta, sprinting towards finish at an incredible pace.</seg>
<seg id="19">I hear the other runners catching their breath.</seg>
<seg id="20">I move to the edge of the route and cheer him on, and he begins to high-five me, but just before that my leg bends, and our hands slightly miss each other.</seg>
<seg id="21">The run down Divadelní Street presents a chance for a brief rest and catching of breath.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is necessary, because there are places ahead of us where the views are breathtaking.</seg>
<seg id="23">Turning onto the Mánesově Bridge presents a view of Prague in its full beauty with the setting sun.</seg>
<seg id="24">I'm not breathing, and my legs are almost carrying me themselves.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the first refreshment, the moment of truth comes.</seg>
<seg id="26">While running along the roadway, Káťou trips on the curb and falls forward.</seg>
<seg id="27">I look to see whether or not she needs help, and I say a series of encouraging words, so that she won't have time to think about the pain.</seg>
<seg id="28">She gets up, and we continue along Kozí Lane, which is one of the narrowest parts of the route, and in this stage in the race there is no longer such a rush, but it is still necessary to pay close attention to surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="29">I still don't realize that the term "narrowest place" will take on its true meaning later.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the Powder Tower, we are frantically cheered on by tourists and other runners' friends.</seg>
<seg id="31">I try to high-five with everyone who puts out his hand, and I advise Káťou to do the same, because ten high-fives with fans is like half an energy bar.</seg>
<seg id="32">It really works, and we speed up again, and although we have fallen quite far behind, the race to catch up has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="33">We overtake dozens of runners, and when I notice someone especially tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: "Come on, just a little farther, you can do it!"</seg>
<seg id="34">After the last refreshment break, no one runs ahead of us any more, and we speed up.</seg>
<seg id="35">So far we have run for an hour and fifteen minutes, and we are adding minutes, so there is nothing to wait for.</seg>
<seg id="36">The three kilometers to the finish are going to hurt, but it is really necessary to make it.</seg>
<seg id="37">The sun has almost set already, and the ending day symbolically slowly ends the race.</seg>
<seg id="38">The last run to the bridge, a turn and then just a straight route to the finish.</seg>
<seg id="39">The pace at which we are running amazes me, and I wonder where comes from.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Come on, we're going under hour thirteen, let's do it!" I call out.</seg>
<seg id="41">We try it, we sprint forward, and there is the finish line.</seg>
<seg id="42">Hour thirteen and six seconds.</seg>
<seg id="43">Well, what can you do?</seg>
<seg id="44">The trainer has set a limit of hour twenty.</seg>
<seg id="45">So seven minutes under the plan.</seg>
<seg id="46">That's a super outcome.</seg>
<seg id="47">Just past the finish line, Káťou's legs give way, and I help her to the railing, where she can rest for a while.</seg>
<seg id="48">She is visibly exhausted, but also visibly happy about her good performance.</seg>
<seg id="49">After a while, I gradually take her out from the space of the finish line.</seg>
<seg id="50">The euphoria prevents us from noticing the mad dash to the lockers.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here, it is obvious that Kozí Lane was not the narrowest place.</seg>
<seg id="52">That place is here, beyond the finish at the river bank, which is being swarmed by almost 10,000 runners squeezed together.</seg>
<seg id="53">If anyone doesn't like crowds, then this is not the place for them.</seg>
<seg id="54">After a while, I too lose my mind and wonder if those beautiful views and the more interesting route than in previous years were worth experiencing what's happening now.</seg>
<seg id="55">From my own experience, I know that hosting an event is nothing to laugh at.</seg>
<seg id="56">When combined with 10,000 people, a rich accompanying program and closure of the entire center of Prague to all traffic, it's a huge challenge.</seg>
<seg id="57">This year's change of route showed the runners many interesting places, which also brought a few really unpleasant surprises.</seg>
<seg id="58">The excellent atmosphere pumped out of the Yellow Spa found a place among runners and in the race itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">The organizers around the route and random spectators intensified it at each meter of the route.</seg>
<seg id="60">During the run through the historic city center, unfortunately there are obstacles that cannot be eliminated, but I don't consider putting the finish to the huge race in a location where one side is bordered by a wall and the other by a river to be the best solution.</seg>
<seg id="61">If I were to say that the race ended when the runners ran to the finish, then I would evaluate it as very successful.</seg>
<seg id="62">Beyond the route, I was a little afraid for the health of the participants, but in the end everything turned out well.</seg>
<seg id="63">Please write to us in the discussion forum whether you liked the route and what your thoughts are about the situation with the finish point.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why can the universe have multiple dimensions and we can't see them?</seg>
<seg id="2">Physicists don't often write best sellers, but Brian Green from Columbia University managed to hit the bull's eye in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="3">His book, "The Elegant Universe", has become for members of the general public the easiest way to delve into issues being addressed today by several theoretical physicists, an effort to unite two excellently functioning, but mutually incompatible, discoveries of the 20th century, quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the causes of the success of "The Elegant Universe" is undoubtedly that when searching for united physical theories, it's not a boring story.</seg>
<seg id="5">Physicists have addressed the basic problem between two key theories (after all, at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and are resolving it so well that it's worth it even to explain it to ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greene even coped so well with the difficult material, that he can't be criticized for how much interesting information he didn't include in his book.</seg>
<seg id="7">Furthermore, he has mostly made up for his "mistake" in another two books: "The Structure of the Universe" and "The Hidden Reality".</seg>
<seg id="8">The author obviously would not even object if his book became obsolete more quickly, but it's a fact that even after 15 years "The Elegant Universe" continues to provide almost everything important that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is relatively likely that in the years to come the situation in this area will be somewhat more lively (for example, since the LHC accelerator will finally run on "full gas"), and so this is a good opportunity to enter the world of modern physics through doors opened up by Greene without force.</seg>
<seg id="10">How many dimensions could our universe have?</seg>
<seg id="11">The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions certainly could seem far-fetched, strange or mystical.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nonetheless, it is specific and entirely acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order for us to understand it, let's shift our vision for a moment from the universe as a whole to something more down to earth, specifically a long and thin basic garden hose.</seg>
<seg id="14">Imagine stretching a 100-meter garden hose from one side of a canyon to another and monitoring the entire scenery from a distance of half a kilometer away (like in the image on the following page).</seg>
<seg id="15">From such a distance, you can easily recognize a long hose stretched in a horizontal direction, but if you happen to suffer from perspicacity, then you will have difficulty figuring out the thickness of the hose.</seg>
<seg id="16">Because of your long distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: a left-right dimension along the hose.</seg>
<seg id="17">When someone asks you where the ant is at a particular moment, you can respond to him with only one detail: the ant's distance from the left (or right) end of the hose.</seg>
<seg id="18">All that we want to say here is that from a half-kilometer distance a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the real world, the hose has thickness.</seg>
<seg id="20">If we enlarge everything, we will suddenly see a second dimension, in the shape of a ring wrapping around the hose.</seg>
<seg id="21">In such an enlarged view, it is obvious that the ant in reality could move in two independent dimensions: in the already well known left-right dimensions along the length of the hose, but also in "a clockwise or counterclockwise direction," meaning around the circular cross-section of the hose.</seg>
<seg id="22">You will start to understand that in order to determine the position of the small ant, you have to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the ring wrapping around the hose.</seg>
<seg id="23">This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional. (Note: Experts point out that this chapter focuses purely on the rupture theory of strings.</seg>
<seg id="24">The non-rupturing aspects are addressed in chapters 12 and 13.)</seg>
<seg id="25">The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long parallel dimension is illustrated by a direct arrow, a dimension in the direction of the perimeter, indicated by a circular arrow, is short and coiled.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nonetheless, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="27">The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.</seg>
<seg id="28">The dimension wrapping the perimeter of the hose is short, coiled and harder to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="29">In order for us to realize the existence of the circular dimension, we had to examine a hose with much better characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="30">The mentioned example illustrates the important property of spatial dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="31">That it is divided into two groups.</seg>
<seg id="32">They can be either large, extensive and therefore not directly obvious, or they can be small, coiled and much harder to observe.</seg>
<seg id="33">Of course, in the specified case we did not exactly re-rub in order to uncover the coiled dimension wrapping the thickness of the hose.</seg>
<seg id="34">It was enough to pick up a telescope for help.</seg>
<seg id="35">But if the hose were thinner, like a piece of hair or a capillary, we could uncover the coiled dimension only with great effort.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein his article, in which he toiled with a huge thought, that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three of the dimensions that we know.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kaluza explained his radical claim by pointing out that an additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework, in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory could be combined into one unified concept.</seg>
<seg id="38">This immediately gives rise the question of how this discovery by Kaluza goes together with the obvious fact that we see three dimensions of space.</seg>
<seg id="39">The answer that Kaluza predicted quietly between the lines, and which was clearly expressed and clarified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, rests and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe could have both large and coiled dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="40">That means that just like the dimension in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe too has a large, extensive and easily visible set of three dimensions, the existence of which we realize at every moment.</seg>
<seg id="41">But analogically to the circumference of a garden hose, the universe too can have additional dimensions, firmly coiled into space with it not obvious that until now they have remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatuses.</seg>
<seg id="42">In order to get a clearer idea of the basis of Kaluza's noteworthy proposal, let's continue focusing on that hose for a while.</seg>
<seg id="43">Imagine that on the circumference of the hose we draw a relatively thick row of rings in black color.</seg>
<seg id="44">From a distance, the hose still appears as a thin one-dimensional line.</seg>
<seg id="45">Now with a telescope, thanks to drawing, we can uncover a coiled dimension even more easily, as shown in figure 2.</seg>
<seg id="46">We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension that is large and almost unlimited, and with another short one and a ring.</seg>
<seg id="47">Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but besides one small circular dimension it has three large spatial dimensions, meaning together four spatial dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="48">It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="49">In order to help our imagination a little, we should notice the illustration in figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.</seg>
<seg id="50">In the image we can enlarge the view of the geometry of the space in a way similar to how we enlarged the surface of the hose.</seg>
<seg id="51">Each of the following levels represents a major enlargement of the geometry of the space from the previous level.</seg>
<seg id="52">Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them in the fourth level of enlargement), if they are coiled into a sufficiently small space; this is how we explain that we have not observed them directly so far.</seg>
<seg id="53">The grid illustrates the well known "large" dimension, while the ring illustrates the new, small and coiled dimension.</seg>
<seg id="54">Just like loops of thread in a thick carpet, these rings too exist in every place with usual dimensions, but for illustration we have sketched them only in interwoven patterns in a grid.</seg>
<seg id="55">The background of figure 4 illustrates the well known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in typical measuring units, such as meters, illustrated with the side of a small square in a grid.</seg>
<seg id="56">On each subsequent image, we will focus on the small area of the previous image; we will enlarge it so that it becomes visible.</seg>
<seg id="57">From the beginning, nothing special happens, as we can see in several of the first levels of enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="58">But when we move further along our path to discover the microscopic properties of the geometry of space - to the fourth level of enlargement in figure 3 - then we will suddenly encounter a new dimension coiled in a ring shape, similar to loops of thread in a thick piece woven piece of carpet.</seg>
<seg id="59">Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions similar to that of circumference of a hose along each point of its length.</seg>
<seg id="60">For illustrative purposes, we have drawn the circular dimension only in certain regularly placed points.</seg>
<seg id="61">Figure 4 summarizes Kaluza's and Klein's idea about the microscopic structure of geometry of space.</seg>
<seg id="62">The similarity to the hose is obvious, but we can even notice some important differences.</seg>
<seg id="63">First, the universe has three large spatial dimensions far sprawling from each other (of which we have drawn only two), and only hose has a large dimension.</seg>
<seg id="64">An even more important difference is that now we are talking about spatial geometry of the universe itself, not about any object within the universe, such as our hose.</seg>
<seg id="65">But the basic idea is the same.</seg>
<seg id="66">If the additional circularly coiled dimension is extremely miniature, it can be recognized, just like the round circumference of the host, much more difficultly than observing obvious, large and extensive dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="67">If the size of an additional dimension is sufficiently small, uncovering it will in fact be beyond the capabilities of our most modern enlargement tools.</seg>
<seg id="68">However, the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not a mere round protuberance inside regular dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration erroneously indicates.</seg>
<seg id="69">The circular dimension is a new dimension, which exists in every point of three regular extensive dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is a dimension that is independent of the remaining three dimensions, just as the top-bottom, left-right and front-back dimensions are mutually independent (and diagonal).</seg>
<seg id="71">A small enough ant could move in all four dimensions, and in order to determine its position we would need four pieces of information, besides the three usual details also the position in the circular dimension; if we figure in time as well, then there are five details, but in any case it there is one more than we would normally expect.</seg>
<seg id="72">Did this interest you?</seg>
<seg id="73">You can purchase the book "The Elegant Universe" by Brian Greene at knihy.idnes.cz.</seg>
<seg id="74">The price of the e-book version is CZK 149.</seg>
<seg id="75">Much to our surprise, we are finding out that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluza's and Klein's considerations show that the existence of additional coiled dimensions cannot be ruled out, if they are small enough.</seg>
<seg id="76">The universe could even have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.</seg>
<seg id="77">How small should they be?</seg>
<seg id="78">The most modern technical equipment can recognize the structure of a billionth of a billionth of a meter.</seg>
<seg id="79">We rarely can observe smaller coiled dimensions.</seg>
<seg id="80">In 1926, Klein combined Kaluza's original idea with a few ideas from quantum mechanics, a subject which was becoming known at the time.</seg>
<seg id="81">His calculations indicated that an additional circular dimension could have the size of approximately one Planck length, a size far beyond the recognition capabilities of today's machines.</seg>
<seg id="82">Since then, the physicists have referred to the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions as the Kaluza-Klein Theory.</seg>

<seg id="2">The overall basis of the "12" is the 12-tactic harmonic form, which you can repeat randomly.</seg>
<seg id="3">Whoever delves into musical theory will find its principle explained in detail here.</seg>
<seg id="4">Jan Homola, or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)</seg>
<seg id="5">This trained puppeteer and string puppet master, whose Facebook profile can be viewed here, has been living as a graphic artist since graduating from high school twelve years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is a guitarist in the band Wohnout, which it is reportedly impossible to quit.</seg>
<seg id="7">By becoming a guitarist, he has followed in his father's footsteps, just like is brother Matěj, the leader of Wohnout.</seg>
<seg id="8">You can begin with training on one string.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They rhythmic model is up to you, and you can think up anything and then simply apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve," advises Honza.</seg>
<seg id="10">When you add another string, you can then change the figure again.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's enough just to listen to and what Honza, what can be thought up with the twelve-member harmony on two strings and how nice it is beginning to sound.</seg>
<seg id="12">If you take the third string, you can already flirt with the melody of a certain song.</seg>
<seg id="13">And when you finally add the fourth, be attentive to changes in tuning, Honza explains in the video.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then Honza returns to the pentatonic, and you can try to put it together with the twelve-member group.</seg>
<seg id="15">So practice it diligently.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can read about how best to do so in the interview with Jan Homola during the first lesson of his electric-guitar-playing school.</seg>

<seg id="1">Another goal without waiting?</seg>
<seg id="2">It's not anything to celebrate a lot about, admits Hradec player Dvořák.</seg>
<seg id="3">We will accept a point, and we are happy for it.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the first half, the other home team, had more chances," recalls the offensive player, who this time scored from a penalty kick.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weren't you nervous when playing it, since, after all there was a lot of booing?</seg>
<seg id="6">I didn't really notice it much, even though at the other goal, there the hometown fans site, it was probably worse.</seg>
<seg id="7">After half an hour you made up for the penalty, but you also got the goal out of the penalty in just under four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="8">What happened?</seg>
<seg id="9">We slept through the beginning, we were passive, and this led to a corner and then a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="10">After that, you rose, and during the first half you were still a better team that had more chances.</seg>
<seg id="11">Why did that change after the break?</seg>
<seg id="12">It's difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="13">I agree that after achieving the goal, we played well until the break.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the cabin, we said we wanted to sustain the pace of the game after it, but we did not achieve that.</seg>
<seg id="15">To be honest, I can't even explain why.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's probably also true that the home team players said something to each other about their game during the break, and they probably were not satisfied with it.</seg>
<seg id="17">You first scored on your rival's field, while at home you haven't yet gotten even one goal.</seg>
<seg id="18">Why such a difference?</seg>
<seg id="19">I wouldn't say that it's such a difference, but it depends on how we battle.</seg>
<seg id="20">We began well in Brno, but it went downhill for us from then, and Plzeň is an entirely different category.</seg>
<seg id="21">For four games you waited for a goal, but were you afraid that it could end up the same after the last game?</seg>
<seg id="22">Well, I don't think so, but we are understandably happy that since the last game we have not had to listen to talk about waiting for a goal.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now we have added another without waiting, but there are still only three in six games, which is not yet much to celebrate about.</seg>

<seg id="3">It is located beneath a glacier, like part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">This situation is now unsettling scientists the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, so far the situation remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since yesterday morning (August 31</seg>
<seg id="7">2014) about the same amount of lava has been erupting from the top of the volcano.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, despite original estimates, its amount is lower than 1,000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.</seg>
<seg id="9">Compared to the previous eruption from August 29</seg>
<seg id="10">2014, it is 50x greater.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, scientists are worried that the lava tunnel could open up in places where it is below ice.</seg>
<seg id="12">If that happened, furthermore with intensity similar to that of the current eruption, it would result in major flooding, both at the Jökulsá á Fjöllum River and at other rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the surroundings of the eruption, there is a strong smell of sulfur, and gases and steam are rising from the top.</seg>
<seg id="14">This certainly is not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption at Fimmvörðuháls in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="15">"This one is much larger, and there are also a lot more gases," says volcano expert Ármann Höskuldsson.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, since yesterday the weather has greatly improved, and in the morning it was almost calm in the area.</seg>
<seg id="17">The traces of the sandstorm have been washed away by rain.</seg>
<seg id="18">The scientists can continue in their work.</seg>
<seg id="19">Orange level (the second highest) applies for aviation for Bárðarbungu and yellow (third) for Askju.</seg>

<seg id="1">The skies above Cheb belonged to courageous Lady Peggy.</seg>
<seg id="2">She went through with her wings.</seg>
<seg id="3">Aviation day in Cheb.</seg>
<seg id="4">Aviation acrobat Peggy Walentin has performed on a Boeing Stearman PT-17, and during the flight she climbed out of the cockpit and made her way to the rack on the top wing of the biplane as well as between the wings.</seg>
<seg id="5">There she is only at the mercy of the strength of her muscles.</seg>
<seg id="6">Aviation Day in Cheb was held this year for the fifth in a row, and the organizers again managed to prepare several interesting air performances.</seg>
<seg id="7">The premiere at the event at the oldest Czech airport was not only "the walk on wings" by German aviation acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also featured the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter plane and the Beechcraft 18 aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="8">It drew attention to itself with its bright coating.</seg>
<seg id="9">The acrobatic practice known as Wingwalking originates from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10">After the First World War, many former war pilots attempted it.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, because of the large number of fatal injuries, it was banned.</seg>
<seg id="12">Today it is slowly returning to the agenda of air show.</seg>
<seg id="13">"After the start, Peggy climbs out of the cockpit and onto the top wing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There she demonstrates different exercises.</seg>
<seg id="15">Near the end of the performance, she moves to the space between the aircraft's wings, where her show continues," explained Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club, the organizer of Aviation Day.</seg>
<seg id="16">Walentin's husband Friedrich is the pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E.</seg>
<seg id="17">If Peggy's performance was the main attraction of the program, then the demonstration of the Mustang fighter plane was the cherry on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="18">The legendary fighter plane was accompanied by Grippens from the Czech Air Force (in numbers).</seg>
<seg id="19">This was the first time aviation fans have been able to see such a joint performance in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="20">Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then performed breathtaking acrobatics for everyone with a plane from 1945.</seg>
<seg id="21">The plane was manufactured during the war, it was probably never used.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was assigned to the army reserves.</seg>
<seg id="23">Since 1963 it has served in the civil sphere.</seg>
<seg id="24">And also as a racing plane.</seg>
<seg id="25">Today it has its home hangar at the airport in Mnichově Hradišti.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the same location there is another pearl of the Cheb Aviation Day, the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.</seg>
<seg id="27">The enormous aircraft cannot be overlooked at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="28">Its polished aluminum coating shines a long distance.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard plane in the colors of the French Air Force has also received admiration.</seg>
<seg id="30">The small airliner got behind the renounced Turbolet, and from Hof, Germany, it brought home part of the German delegation at the air show.</seg>
<seg id="31">Cheb's neighbors from the German side of the border gave performances including some with reconstructed Jak 18T aircraft and three-member formations using Bücker Jungmann biplanes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exhibition in Prague in a year?</seg>
<seg id="2">The arena would be sold out, according to Jágr's planned going away party.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It would be noble if something like this were done during the World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it will depend on what position the association takes," he said in Jihlava following the Golden Match exhibition, during which the impressive team from the Nagano Olympics met again.</seg>
<seg id="5">This included players who participated in the golden hat trick.</seg>
<seg id="6">The players would be in the mood, wouldn't they?</seg>
<seg id="7">Certainly.</seg>
<seg id="8">In short, it would be good to have a parting celebration with the golden generation during the championship.</seg>
<seg id="9">I believe that during the tournament we can find one or two days when everyone will be completely free and a location where everyone could meet for such a match.</seg>
<seg id="10">I'll tell Guma (Jiřímu Šlégrovi) or Béďovi Ščerbanovi (the organizer of the Jihlava match), would could take responsibility for it...</seg>
<seg id="11">The arena would be sold out.</seg>
<seg id="12">But what if you're going to participate in the New Jersey play-off?</seg>
<seg id="13">Then I'll fly in...</seg>
<seg id="14">But do you not want to play on the team?</seg>
<seg id="15">Or has the Jihlava match somehow changed your mind?</seg>
<seg id="16">The team and exhibition matches are two different things, and performance is decisive in the team.</seg>
<seg id="17">The only thing is that people would like to see me there, but performance is decisive, especially for the World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="18">It should be participated in by players who have what it takes, not because they have a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="19">My decision has not changed at all.</seg>
<seg id="20">How did you enjoy the Nagano reunion?</seg>
<seg id="21">Just meeting with the players was great.</seg>
<seg id="22">Each person recalled events and had a lot of fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was a great experience both for fans and for us hockey players.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, the most important part was honoring Ivan Hlinka.</seg>
<seg id="25">And it's good to remind everyone of the history of our hockey, since one generation is leaving who really cared about it.</seg>
<seg id="26">Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.</seg>
<seg id="27">Do you yourself still remember your first team match?</seg>
<seg id="28">Such things are impossible to forget.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was against the Calgary Flames, and there were three young people, Robert Holík, Robert Reichel and I, and we joined in one group of three.</seg>
<seg id="30">It was the first team start for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="31">But it would be inaccurate to say that we dominated in any way.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dominik Hašek played the goal position in Jihlava after a long period.</seg>
<seg id="33">What did you say about his performance?</seg>
<seg id="34">Hašan never surprises me on the ice.</seg>
<seg id="35">I wanted to give it back to him with criticism, but I can't. (Hašek criticized Jágra for the reasons why he decided to quit the team.) He played the goal position excellently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hnilička performed great too.</seg>
<seg id="37">This was even though he trained with me at night once, and he had shortcomings.</seg>
<seg id="38">Now he played the goal position fantastically.</seg>

<seg id="2">Prominent guests will arrive at the NH Hotel in Smíchovský on late Monday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">People will be able to view celebrities including Petr Čech from Chelsea, team coach Pavel Vrba and others.</seg>
<seg id="4">And that figure in the black jersey is Tomáš Rosický!</seg>
<seg id="5">Arsenal's reserve player and team captain arrived at the gathering at around 11:30 a.m. and was one of the last to do so.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We can await a nice game against the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="7">Who would not look forward to it?" he said when he appeared before reporters in his team uniform.</seg>
<seg id="8">Czech team's program</seg>
<seg id="9">Monday, September 1: meeting start, first training</seg>
<seg id="10">Tuesday, September 2: Open training for fans (6:30 p.m., Letná) Autograph signing (8:00 p.m.)</seg>
<seg id="11">Wednesday, September 3: Czech Republic - USA (8:15 p.m., Letná)</seg>
<seg id="12">Tuesday, September 9: Czech Republic - Netherlands (8:45 p.m., Letná), end of meeting</seg>
<seg id="13">Rosický and his associates can be supported by fans already before the Wednesday game against the USA (8:15 p.m.).</seg>
<seg id="14">The team has opened Tuesday training for them, which will start at Letná at 6:30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will be followed by autograph signing, at which neither Rosický nor Čech will be missing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, of course, this meeting of the national team will be calmer.</seg>
<seg id="17">This has been praised by coach Vrba, who in the spring complained about the number of community events.</seg>
<seg id="18">We will finally be able to devote our attention to what we want to devote it to.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now we will focus on the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is an advantage when you have players together for eight days.</seg>
<seg id="21">We will have time to practice things that so far we have not had enough time for," said Vrba, who has headed the national team since January.</seg>
<seg id="22">When entering the new qualification cycle, the Czech soccer team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image.</seg>
<seg id="23">The team under Vrba's leadership has three games behind it, all of them preparatory matches.</seg>
<seg id="24">It tied with Norway and Finland 2:2 and lost to Austria 1:2.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, those results were not important any more.</seg>
<seg id="26">Only now.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the match with the Netherlands, the qualification is beginning for advancement to the 2016 European Championship.</seg>
<seg id="28">Of course, the Czech men's team would be aided if it managed the rehearsal game against the USA.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The first year was for us to get to know each other.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now results are important.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to think about how we can be successful," said Vrba.</seg>
<seg id="32">The only player in the 23-member nomination who has health problems is David Lafata.</seg>
<seg id="33">He suffers from a fever.</seg>
<seg id="34">If he doesn't manage to recover by the Wednesday game against the USA, coach Vrba could call up one more offensive player.</seg>

<seg id="1">Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed</seg>
<seg id="2">A British woman says she spent many years thinking she was going to die after a misdiagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage life believing that she only had years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">She actually had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.</seg>
<seg id="5">Charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition.</seg>
<seg id="6">About 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have CMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, an awkward gait and curled toes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sufferers can also experience numbness or pain and the condition is incurable and progressive, meaning symptoms get worse over time.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Rodgers was 13 she was under the impression that she suffered from Friedreich's ataxia (FA) - a condition which had a very poor prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rodgers thought that she was going to be wheelchair bound by the time she was 18 and dead before she reached her 30s.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mother-of-two, who is now 51, said: "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.</seg>
<seg id="11">I was falling daily and everything took me longer to do.</seg>
<seg id="12">I could never roller-skate or skateboard with other kids and got bullied at school a lot because of the way I walked and ran.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rodgers said when she was aged 13, after several operations to release her Achilles tendons and straighten out her feet, she took a peak at her medical notes when her consultant left the room which said that she suffered from FA.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I felt guilty because I'd been nosy and so I didn't tell anybody, but I did come home, look up the condition at the library and wrote to the FA Association," she said.</seg>
<seg id="15">When I got the information back I was gobsmacked and in the worst state of panic possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and dead by the time I was 25 and in between gradually lose all my ability.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was going through this on my own and I planned my own funeral.</seg>
<seg id="18">She said by the time she reached 17 she realised that her walking abilities hadn't deteriorated as much as she thought they would have and asked her surgeon about it.</seg>
<seg id="19">He just stood up and hugged me and said 'my dear I don't think you have it, as you would be in a wheelchair now.'</seg>
<seg id="20">I think you have something a lot less life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="21">After some genetic testing she was found to have CMT.</seg>
<seg id="22">"When he explained what CMT was, I thought I'd drawn the lucky straw," she said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Charity CMT UK has launched CMT awareness month to try to draw attention to the condition.</seg>

<seg id="1">Washington-area business owners" tax burden mounts as economy rebounds</seg>
<seg id="2">A rebounding economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">State and local tax bills for companies across the country grew modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to new research released last week, and Washington-area firms were no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">District, Maryland and Virginia businesses collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">Businesses" state and local tax burdens last year expanded by 4.3 percent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after back-to-back years of shrinking bills in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes rose at a faster clip, 4.3 percent, than local levies, 3.9 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, a tax policy group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from firms.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, at 28 percent, generates the least amount of tax revenue, proportionately, from business.</seg>
<seg id="10">Much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a rebound in companies" real estate values, researchers say, which pushed property taxes up 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of sub-1 percent growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large share of those gains came from big states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears to be the same story in the Washington area as well.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively forked over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012 - year-over-year growth of 4.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent bounceback in property values isn't doing nearly as much to inflate state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of companies" tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and D.C. firms pay nearly half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their property, especially the tax base surrounding the D.C. area, is owned either by the government or by nonprofits, which don't pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">So Maryland is forced to rely much more heavily on, for example, its income taxes to pay for the same services you have in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent rebound in business tax revenue cannot all be attributed to the recovering real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Business incomes also appear to be on the mend, according to the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region reported state corporate income taxes of $2.3 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">While trending in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses isn't growing at the same pace in all three places.</seg>
<seg id="22">The District's rate of growth was level with the national average, at 4.3 percent, while Maryland's growth was substantially faster at 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia posted a below-average tax bill bump of 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax by far of the three jurisdictions (all of which have flat corporate rates) at 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Maryland's corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while the District's stands at a relatively high 9.975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia had lower state and local business taxes and an overall better business tax climate than Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">The District wasn't evaluated in the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite its advantage, Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering its corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, in line with Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state continues to meet revenue goals in the coming year, the law could push the state's business income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington region seem to be faring better and thus paying more state and local taxes, according to the recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - the pass-through structure by which most small firms are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia surged 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster rate of growth than overall business taxes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Researchers say that trend and the increase in business taxes nationwide are likely to continue this year, with overall sales tax revenue for state and local governments up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, the Washington area may lag behind as the slowdown in federal spending takes its toll on the region's labor market.</seg>

<seg id="2">Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her arrival three days ago at a New York City hospital, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.</seg>
<seg id="4">We are keeping our fingers crossed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital Thursday after an emergency call that she was in cardiac arrest at an Upper East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Doctors are intentionally keeping her sedated and under close supervision until they're more comfortable with her condition, which remains "serious."</seg>
<seg id="7">Reaction has been widespread, including overwhelming online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.</seg>

<seg id="1">Reality is distorted by headlines</seg>
<seg id="2">The fact that media organizations distort reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="3">I know that headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are a lot of so-called "readers" who don't read anything.</seg>
<seg id="4">And it's a fact that has really bothered me recently, or, better put, infuriates me.</seg>
<seg id="5">It has to do with, for example, articles about the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</seg>
<seg id="6">Headlines such as "Israel attacks Gaza" are entirely common.</seg>
<seg id="7">First you read in the text that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to rockets being fired from Gaza, often during the declared ceasefire.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then you get to a headline that says "Both sides violate ceasefire".</seg>
<seg id="9">Does the journalistic profession realize that with their approach they are directly contributing to anti-Semitic sentiment, which is growing all over Europe (and not only there).</seg>
<seg id="10">It hasn't been even sixty years since the end of the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are still people alive who survived the Holocaust.</seg>
<seg id="12">When I saw a video from the Federal Republic of Germany, where a crowd was shouting things like "Jewish swine" and similar despicable phrases, it struck me.</seg>
<seg id="13">Does the world want to finish what Hitler didn't manage to?</seg>
<seg id="14">Do our journalists realize that after the Jews, the Slavs were targeted for liquidation?</seg>
<seg id="15">Ladies and Gentlemen in the journalist profession, please be a bit more careful in your work.</seg>
<seg id="16">You are often referred to as "watchdogs of democracy".</seg>
<seg id="17">So enhance that.</seg>
<seg id="18">While it's still here.</seg>
<seg id="19">And also promote the right of the only truly democratic country in the Middle East to defend its population.</seg>
<seg id="20">How would you want our government to behave if one of our neighbors decided that it wanted to liquidate the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the world's map?</seg>
<seg id="21">Maybe you should realize one more fact.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nearly 20% of the Arabs on Israel's territory have Israeli citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="23">And they feel good there.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you ask them why they don't go to be among "their own", for example to Gaza, they will ask you why they should.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Israel, they have work, social certainties and top quality health care (I have seen with my own eyes how Arabs too go to the top quality Hadassa hospital, which is financed from sponsorship donations from Jews around the world, and those Arabs are understandably treated there).</seg>
<seg id="26">Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its rockets.</seg>
<seg id="27">The only true way of helping Gaza, and the tense region, is to remove and disarm Hamas.</seg>
<seg id="28">And not to condemn Israel, even if only indirectly through headlines.</seg>
<seg id="29">Get informed about Hamas' practices and its use of people as human shields.</seg>
<seg id="30">Get informed that Hamas' goal is to liquidate the State of Israel at any cost.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even if it causes the death of innocent Arab children.</seg>
<seg id="32">Get informed that Hamas is on the list of global terrorist organizations.</seg>
<seg id="33">Get informed that in the nine years of self-governance in Gaza, it could have blossomed thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, for which of course the rulers of Gaza don't pay, and then they even get upset when power supplies are sometimes interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="35">If Hamas did not invest its money into constructing underground tunnels to enable suicide bombers to penetrate into Israel, but instead into activities such as construction of residential housing, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers from Gaza would live much better.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion</seg>
<seg id="2">AMAZON just confirmed what the Information reported Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a hundred other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was widely expected to be the buyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago the sale of Twitch to Google's video service, for a cool billion, looked all wrapped up, and the pairing seemed natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, set out to be a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to broadcast their in-game feats; a "YouTube for live gaming," in Business Insider's words.</seg>
<seg id="7">Twitch's interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And "let's play," a genre of videos in which wiseacres give (mostly older) games the Mystery Science Theater treatment, are already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">The point is, YouTube comes up a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube was acquiring Twitch was greeted with a yawn, a textbook example of an entrenched tech company buying out a potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube fell through, considering it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All we have at the moment is this statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery, frankly, is Twitch's incredible success.</seg>
<seg id="13">To snobs like me who declare that they'd rather play sports than watch them, it's hard to see the appeal of watching games rather than taking up a controller myself.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's one thing to look over your friend's shoulder at 3 in the morning as she creeps through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch some rando get 20 headshots in a row in Call of Duty.</seg>
<seg id="15">All the games you could be watching right now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are first-person, so watching footage of them, without controlling the viewpoint yourself, can be a Do It Right-worthy recipe for a headache.</seg>
<seg id="17">I concede that speedruns, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time, are entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But unless someone is a virtuoso at gaming or humour, his Twitch channel isn't likely to be all that interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what do sceptics like me know?</seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch has 55 million unique visitors monthly and is the fourth-largest source of peak internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">How, exactly, will Amazon capitalise on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It's hard to imagine Twitch being folded into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have just swallowed Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Twitch has something any company would love to attract: hordes of advertiser-coveted young men.</seg>
<seg id="24">As Twitch chief Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "are both believers in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no sign of shrinking, even - gulp - as a spectator sport.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Second Foundational Falsehood of Creationism.</seg>
<seg id="2">Another translation into Czech of a writing by American atheist vlogger AronRa.</seg>
<seg id="3">This time on the topic: "Scriptures are the Word of God."</seg>
<seg id="4">Original video attached.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 2nd foundational falsehood of creationism is the belief that sacred scriptures were written by a god rather than by the actual human authors.</seg>
<seg id="6">When believers argue over any of the many things which contradict their religion, they often challenge us to decide whom we are going to believe.</seg>
<seg id="7">The alleged "word" of God? Or that of Men?</seg>
<seg id="8">As if human inquiry had no chance against the authority they imagine their doctrine to be.</seg>
<seg id="9">But when they say, "men", they're talking about science.</seg>
<seg id="10">And when they refer to the "word of God", they're talking about myths written about God by men.</seg>
<seg id="11">If there really is an intelligent and purposeful creator, then it would have to be he who constructed the fossil record revealing evolutionary history, and he has to be the one who conceived the genetic patterns which also trace that same course, and it must have been he who added the other lines of evidence which point to the evolutionary conclusion exclusively and in brilliant detail.</seg>
<seg id="12">Why else would all these things exist?</seg>
<seg id="13">It's as if he were trying to tell us something!</seg>
<seg id="14">Men couldn't create any of those things.</seg>
<seg id="15">But men can tell stories, whoppers in fact.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it was men who wrote all the scriptures pretending to speak for God.</seg>
<seg id="17">Every one of the world's supposedly "holy" doctrines of any religion describe themselves as being written by men, not gods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Men who were "moved by" or inspired by their favorite gods, or perhaps taking dictation from angels, but they were written by lowly imaginative yet imperfect mortals none the less; not by angels, and certainly not by gods.</seg>
<seg id="19">If there really was one true god, it should be a singular composite of every religion's gods, an uber-galactic super-genius, and the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="20">If a being of that magnitude ever wrote a book, then there would only be one such document; one book of God.</seg>
<seg id="21">It would be dominant everywhere in the world with no predecessors or parallels or alternatives in any language, because mere human authors couldn't possibly compete with it.</seg>
<seg id="22">And you wouldn't need faith to believe it, because it would be consistent with all evidence and demonstrably true, revealing profound morality and wisdom far beyond contemporary human capacity.</seg>
<seg id="23">It would invariably inspire a unity of common belief for every reader.</seg>
<seg id="24">If God wrote it, we could expect no less.</seg>
<seg id="25">But what we see instead is the very opposite of that.</seg>
<seg id="26">Instead of only one religion leading to one ultimate truth, we have many different religions with no common origin, all constantly sharding into ever more deeply-divided denominations, seeking conflicting truths, and each somehow claiming divine guidance despite their ongoing divergence in every direction.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Jewish Torah, the Christian gospels, the Qur'an of Islam, the Kitab-i-Aqdas of Bahá'u'lláh, the Hindu Vedas, the Avestas of Zarathustra, the Adi-Granth of the Sikhs, the Mahabarata's Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, and the Urantia book are all declared to be the "absolute truth" and the "revealed word" of the "one true" god, and believers of each say the others are deceived.</seg>
<seg id="28">The only logical probability is that they all are â€“at least to some degree.</seg>
<seg id="29">None of these have any particular advantage over the others.</seg>
<seg id="30">None of them have any evidentiary support, and none of them are historically verifiable.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I'm Dr. Paul Maier, professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm not saying that now I have proven the Bible is authoritative, is accurate historically.</seg>
<seg id="33">Of course not.</seg>
<seg id="34">You still have to have faith."</seg>
<seg id="35">All of them require faith, and apologetics as well, because they also contain inconsistencies, absurdities, and primitive notions once held true but which have since been disproved.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they can claim no evidence of divine wisdom.</seg>
<seg id="37">Many of them promote heinous atrocities in place of morality, and many claim to be validated by prophecies now fulfilled â€“ where each may also contain prophesies which failed to come to pass as predicted.</seg>
<seg id="38">Leading theologians admit that all of the scriptures of any religion were written by human hands and were thus subject to the interpretations, impressions and perspectives of their primitive and often prejudiced and politically-motivated authors, and they cite this as the explanation behind many of the contradictions in those books, especially those in the Bible.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Well I wouldn't call them contradictions as much as commentaries, the one on the other.</seg>
<seg id="40">Again, let's point out, we probably do have two different authors here who's work was blended together then in editorial revisioning somewhat."</seg>
<seg id="41">He's right about there being more than one author for Genesis, and it was definitely not an eyewitness account!</seg>
<seg id="42">Some experts now recognize four different sources just for the Pentateuch, the five books of "Moses", and they don't credit Moses as the author of any of them as he evidently never existed as described.</seg>
<seg id="43">The scholarly consensus is that Genesis was compiled, (probably by Ezra) from several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">Other documents filtered in at the same time, all of which attributed to human authors.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Bible is nowhere near as old as believers say it is!</seg>
<seg id="46">The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological texts known for the still unfinished basis of all of western monotheism, yet they're each centuries younger than the origins of Zoroastrian, Buddhist, Hindu, Hellenist, Druidic, Chinese and Egyptian religions.</seg>
<seg id="47">Christianity began with the Gnostic faith, and then the Docetics, and Ebionites, and their completely different perspectives of Jesus were eventually combined into a kind of compromise called Orthodoxy.</seg>
<seg id="48">Other Christian subsets like the Luciferians were overrun and discredited by further Biblical revisions.</seg>
<seg id="49">One of these revisions relates to the king of Ugarit around 3,500 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="50">As his followers were the principle competition with the emerging religion of Moses, scribes working on the New Testament chose to demonize Ba'al ZeBul, the "Lord on High", by distorting his name to Beelzebub, the "Lord of the Flies".</seg>
<seg id="51">So the Bible has been deliberately and deceptively altered for both religious and political reasons.</seg>
<seg id="52">The rest of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century in a series of committee decisions at a convention at Nicea.</seg>
<seg id="53">Four gospels were accepted and sixteen more were rejected, all by a show of hands, as if the facts of the matter could be evaluated or dismissed by popular vote.</seg>
<seg id="54">"The way the canon developed was by what was being read on Sunday in the centers of Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="55">What do you read on the 2nd Sunday after Easter in the church in Jerusalem?</seg>
<seg id="56">What's the church of Rome reading at this time?</seg>
<seg id="57">And they found that again and again, they were zeroing in on the same stories in the gospels.</seg>
<seg id="58">And so the core of the canon kind of developed from the usage of the early church".</seg>
<seg id="59">So the council simply accepted as gospel whatever few relevant stories the uneducated masses happened to like at that time.</seg>
<seg id="60">But they still opted to remove more than a dozen books from the Bible even though they were still referenced by other books they chose to include.</seg>
<seg id="61">Among the rejected items were the writings of both apostles and prophets.</seg>
<seg id="62">Why would God's word refer us to other books which were some human's word, and/or are no longer available?</seg>
<seg id="63">Who were the real editors here?</seg>
<seg id="64">The Bible often names human authors.</seg>
<seg id="65">But how could it make such an admission if God were the real author and editor of this haphazard jumble of fables, parables, and psalm lyrics?</seg>
<seg id="66">The Bible was very definitely written by men, and not superior men either; far from it!</seg>
<seg id="67">This is why so much of it can be shown to be historically and scientifically dead wrong about damned-near everything back-to-front.</seg>
<seg id="68">We're talking about people who believe snakes and donkeys can talk, who believe in incantations, blood sacrifice, ritual spells, enchanted artifacts, pyrotechnic potions, astrology, and the five elements of witchcraft.</seg>
<seg id="69">They thought that if you use a magic wand to sprinkle blood all over someone, it will cure them of leprosy.</seg>
<seg id="70">We're talking about people who think that rabbits chew cud, and that bats are birds, and whales are fish, and that Pi is a round number.</seg>
<seg id="71">These folks believed that if you display striped patterns to a pregnant cow, it would bare striped calves.</seg>
<seg id="72">How could anyone say that who knows anything about genetics?</seg>
<seg id="73">Obviously the authors of this book didn't.</seg>
<seg id="74">If the Bible had been written by a supreme being, then it wouldn't contain the mistakes that it does.</seg>
<seg id="75">If it was written by a truly superior being, and meant to be read as a literal history, then the Bible wouldn't contain anything that it does.</seg>
<seg id="76">As a moral guide, it utterly fails, because much of the original Hebrew scriptures were written by ignorant and bigoted savages who condoned and promoted animal cruelty, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, spousal abuse, child abuse, child molestation, abortion, pillage, murder, cannibalism, genocide, and prejudice against race, nationality, religion, sex, and sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="77">To justify their own inhumanity by claiming to do the will of God.</seg>
<seg id="78">But creationists still continue to ignore all of that.</seg>
<seg id="79">Some of their sites even admit that wherever reality conflicts with the Bible, then reality must be ignored!</seg>
<seg id="80">And why is that?</seg>
<seg id="81">Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god either.</seg>
<seg id="82">One is the other in their world.</seg>
<seg id="83">Ironically, the faithful reject the "works" of God as "worshipping creation over the creator."</seg>
<seg id="84">But then they prop up the words of men before God, as God, and even insist that disproving their supposedly "holy" books would somehow disprove God too.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not just their version of God, but everyone else's version of God as well.</seg>
<seg id="86">Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God lied.</seg>
<seg id="87">They cannot accept that God could exist but the Bible be wrong because they can't distinguish doctrine from deity.</seg>
<seg id="88">So it is a form of idolatry wherein the believers worship man-made compilations as though those books were God himself -because they think it is HIS word.</seg>
<seg id="89">But God never wrote or dictated any of the scriptures of any religion.</seg>
<seg id="90">Everything men chose to reject from or include in their supposedly "inalterable word" of whatever god was conceived, composed, compiled, translated, interpreted, edited, and often deliberately altered and enhanced by mere fallible men.</seg>

<seg id="2">Screenshot with a list of leaked files</seg>
<seg id="3">A so far anonymous user on the 4chan website has been publishing naked and even pornographic photos of American celebrities, the U.S. website Mashable.com reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">It reportedly gained unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple's servers, where the affected users had uploaded them via automatic back-ups of images from iPhones and iPads.</seg>
<seg id="5">Apple has not yet commented about the problem.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some celebrities are denying the authenticity of the pictures, say they are forgeries, but others have already admitted that they are genuine.</seg>
<seg id="7">They include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known from the title role of Katniss in the "Hunger Games" movie series and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who has played in movies such as "Die Hard 4.0".</seg>
<seg id="8">The hacker's aim is to use the photos and videos to get rich.</seg>
<seg id="9">Interest in them has reportedly been expressed by American magazines, but according to report on 4chan, the hacker would rather get money from the community.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the website The Next Web, the incident is very likely due to a weakness in security of the iCloud.</seg>
<seg id="11">Two days ago, a tool reported on the website GitHub, which made it possible to gain passwords to user accounts through brute force, by automatically repeating log-in attempts with various passwords.</seg>
<seg id="12">That tool provably worked, but Apple patched the hole two days later.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, it is clear that potential attackers had a lot of time to gain access to various accounts before the tool was made available to the public.</seg>
<seg id="14">As a preventive precaution, iCloud users should change their Apple ID passwords.</seg>
<seg id="15">What's important is the length of the password, not how complex it is.</seg>
<seg id="16">A good length is at least 12 characters.</seg>
<seg id="17">The leak of naked photos of celebrities can be considered a reminder of the need to use online services securely.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the servers of companies such as Apple, Google and Microsoft are secured much better than computers in homes and small companies, uploading of sensitive photographs in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.</seg>
<seg id="19">If you want to back up explicit photos or any sensitive contents online, you should encrypt the files before uploading them.</seg>
<seg id="20">It also makes sense to set up automatic back-ups from a phone in a way that ensures that they occur only over WiFi and after the phone is connected to a charger.</seg>
<seg id="21">That way you will be able to move sensitive photos to a "safe place" in time, and mainly you will have time to delete bad photos, so they will not unnecessarily take up space in online storage services.</seg>

<seg id="1">Smart ways to save on college textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">With the cost of college textbooks surpassing $1,000 a year for many students, soon-to-be sophomore Matt Schroeder came up with a smart way to trim costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He worked out a system of borrowing books from upperclassmen, offering nominal compensation to get them to delay selling them back.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My calculus book that usually costs $180, I got for the semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A biscuit," says Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Required texts for his last semester would have cost $430, he says.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">The College Board says the average student will spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have a variety of options for managing these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Online outlets and creative approaches like Schroeder's are increasingly the go-to choices for students.</seg>
<seg id="9">Renting textbooks is on the rise, allowing students to use a book for the semester, often at a significant discount to buying.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 campus bookstores, says textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry research shows that about one-fourth of books at college bookstores in this past spring semester were rented, says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fewer than half of all texts are purchased at campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores trade association.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the 101 on the best ways to score a deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buying online</seg>
<seg id="15">Some new book prices can be one-third of what you might find at the campus bookstore if you go online.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler carries a list price of nearly $290 but can be purchased new for $239.99 at specialty textbook retailer Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying used</seg>
<seg id="18">If you do not mind other people's notes or wear and tear, used texts are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Calculus" is selling for $93.49 used on Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he had paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book was selling for $48 new.</seg>
<seg id="22">Academics like Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's College Without Walls, suggest students check with their professors to see if previous editions are acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the classwork.</seg>
<seg id="24">If so, old editions can often be found for a tiny fraction of the cost of the latest version.</seg>
<seg id="25">Besides Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular alternative for used books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Renting</seg>
<seg id="27">Renting your textbooks is worth considering if you take reasonable care of them, you remember to return them and you do not care to own them after you complete the class.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80 per cent of the cost of buying a book new.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the length of the semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Know the rules of the store you rent from, including any penalties you could be assessed for taking notes, highlighting, or wear and tear.</seg>
<seg id="31">Renter, beware: If you fail to return the book, penalties can actually exceed the cost of buying it new.</seg>
<seg id="32">E-books</seg>
<seg id="33">Getting e-books instead of traditional texts is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes those books are essentially rented by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc .</seg>
<seg id="35">Chegg will rent "Calculus" for six months for about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Bracey says students in literature classes can often find the best bargains since many classics are now available to download for free, while science and engineering texts can be extremely expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">No matter what, shop around.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Gault, 29, who is about to enter Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to price books since it ensures you are shopping for the right text.</seg>
<seg id="39">Before ordering online, Gault says, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">He learned that lesson the hard way.</seg>
<seg id="41">A book he purchased was back-ordered for four weeks, and he ended up paying full price at the college bookstore.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mud, nothing but mud.</seg>
<seg id="2">And then in a well they found the torso of a rifle from the end of the war.</seg>
<seg id="3">That well is located not far from the Church of St. George.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We uncovered the surrounding vegetation and began pulling out an aged deposition, about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.</seg>
<seg id="5">When we got close to the clay bottom, we reached a barrel," Radomil Novák recalled.</seg>
<seg id="6">We pulled it out, cleaned it and discovered that it was the torso of a German assault rifle used by SS units.</seg>
<seg id="7">The finding was reportedly unusual.</seg>
<seg id="8">"According to information available to me, these types of rifles were not manufactured until near the end of the war.</seg>
<seg id="9">And there were about 300,000 of them," Novák added.</seg>
<seg id="10">All items built with wood eventually decompose, and therefore it is not usable.</seg>
<seg id="11">Of course, its body has been preserved and retains its shape.</seg>
<seg id="12">How did it end up in the well?</seg>
<seg id="13">One explanation exists.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Maybe people who needed to get rid of weapons used by the SS threw it in their, probably out of fear of being expelled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Fascists fleeing certainly did not do it.</seg>
<seg id="16">They discarded weapons in the forest," say the founders.</seg>
<seg id="17">The rifle was the only thing found in the well by the finders, members of the Jeseníky chapter of Friends of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There could have been hand grenades there as well, since there used to be a lot of them everywhere around, and therefore we slowed digging work and carefully sifted through the mud, so that nothing unfortunate would happen, but there was nothing else down there," Novák said.</seg>
<seg id="19">The finding will end up in the depository of a museum at a chateau in nearby Slezských Rudolticích.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ukrainian general: I have not yet freed the captured Czech</seg>
<seg id="2">An exclusive interview by Aktuálně.cz with General Volodymyr Ruban, who is freeing Ukrainian soldiers from captivity by pro-Russian separatists.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kiev/Prague - "Excuse me, I have to pick it up... they are calling me from Donetsk," he said, apologizing perhaps eight times during an exclusive interview conducted by Aktuálně.cz with Ukrainian General Volodymyr Ruban, who is also the director of the local Center for Liberation of Prisoners of War.</seg>
<seg id="4">General Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.</seg>
<seg id="5">During each such interruption, it was not possible to hear the names of the people, their numbers and locations, where they are - or where they should be - which Ruban will clear up with his counterpart on the other end of the phone line.</seg>
<seg id="6">"That's right, go there," he said, ending a quick discussion with someone in Donetsk, and then he focused on ours again.</seg>
<seg id="7">Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the reserves, a former fighter plane pilot and was an active participant in the Maidan protests.</seg>
<seg id="8">Still yesterday, when we arranged our interview, he was in Donetsk.</seg>
<seg id="9">He devotes himself to freeing Ukrainian soldiers captured by pro-Russian separatists 24 hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="10">Aktuálně.cz: Perhaps you know that there are also Czechs fighting on the pro-Russian separatists' side.</seg>
<seg id="11">Our counter-intelligence service estimates that there are up to 30 of them.</seg>
<seg id="12">But of course, there could be many more.</seg>
<seg id="13">Have you already encountered any Czech prisoners of war during your negotiations?</seg>
<seg id="14">Volodymyr Ruban: I have already freed captured Serbs, Dagestanis, Chechens, one Swede and a Georgian, but not a Czech yet.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I know whom to turn to in Prague if we encounter one of your countrymen among prisoners of war and how to free him.</seg>
<seg id="16">A Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists</seg>
<seg id="17">A.cz: What advice would you give to Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and are captured by Ukrainian soldiers?</seg>
<seg id="18">They should understand that if they are fighting as Czechs under Ukrainian banners of volunteers and separatists capture them, then after questioning them they will be shot without a pardon, just like any other foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="19">The separatists consider these men to be mercenaries, and they say such people don't deserve anything other than death.</seg>
<seg id="20">But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists and there is, for example, a Czech among them, they will put him behind bars and negotiate with him as a prisoner of war.</seg>
<seg id="21">In short, that man will live.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Ukrainian side behaves like a country even in war.</seg>
<seg id="23">A.cz: And how many Ukrainian prisoners of war have you already managed to rescue?</seg>
<seg id="24">If I understand well, by exchanging.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some sources say that the number exceeded a hundred men just recently.</seg>
<seg id="26">Long ago, we already stopped counting how many people we've helped.</seg>
<seg id="27">We just freed them, we did not rescue them from war if they decided to continue in battles.</seg>
<seg id="28">The rescuers in a war are doctors, surgeons, but certainly not us.</seg>
<seg id="29">That is how it was.</seg>
<seg id="30">And every day there are more and more.</seg>
<seg id="31">Every day we rescue someone.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sometimes one person, and sometimes four or five.</seg>
<seg id="33">And there isn't always an exchange involved.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes just a mere human request is enough to gain the release of prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="35">A.cz: Word has it that in just a few months you have gained a lot of authority in dealings with the pro-Russian separatists and even their trust, just like in Ukrainian society.</seg>
<seg id="36">How did you manage to earn respect from both warring parties?</seg>
<seg id="37">That's a difficult question.</seg>
<seg id="38">One of the officers in Kiev has given me the nickname "the crazy general with steel balls".</seg>
<seg id="39">That doesn't offend me.</seg>
<seg id="40">But perhaps it highlights the basis of our work.</seg>
<seg id="41">As the head of the Ukrainian Officers Association, I had already earned certain authority previously.</seg>
<seg id="42">I never take advantage of people, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.</seg>
<seg id="43">No matter what's happening, I act honestly and tell the truth.</seg>
<seg id="44">I do so even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government or for the representatives in Donetsk or Luhansk.</seg>
<seg id="45">And if they torture and kill people?</seg>
<seg id="46">Then I simply tell them that they are torturing and killing.</seg>
<seg id="47">And that those are crimes.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time, they often risk their lives, and they even impressed me during prisoner swaps... this work can be the end for me at any time... I don't have to return to it.</seg>
<seg id="49">A.cz: How many executions and incidents of torture of prisoners are you aware of?</seg>
<seg id="50">... (long pause)... Both Ukrainians and separatists resort to torturing prisoners during questioning.</seg>
<seg id="51">Unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id="52">And executions?</seg>
<seg id="53">They take place only on the Donetsk side.</seg>
<seg id="54">I don't have any information about the Ukrainian army executing any prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="55">I don't have any information either to suggest that the Ukrainian army would even resort to such a tactic.</seg>
<seg id="56">We have a guess about the number of executions, but I can neither give you any numbers, nor do I want to.</seg>
<seg id="57">A.cz: Please describe to me the character among the pro-Russian separatist and their motives.</seg>
<seg id="58">They include officers and even veterans from Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="59">They are seeking independence and perhaps even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk, or at least they say so.</seg>
<seg id="60">They no longer want to play their cards with the Ukrainian oligarchs.</seg>
<seg id="61">The separatists have had enough of the oligarchs an are their unwavering opponents, for life and death.</seg>
<seg id="62">As we say, they're up to their necks.</seg>
<seg id="63">By the way, the same dreams and wishes were expressed by people at the Maidan.</seg>
<seg id="64">And now there is some speculation: Russia is supporting the separatists, and the West is supporting Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="65">I consider one speculation large and the other small.</seg>
<seg id="66">But just that sentence hides within it an implacable dispute.</seg>
<seg id="67">A.cz: For example, what's your impression of one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?</seg>
<seg id="68">Whenever I cross the front line, I'm unarmed and raise my bare hands to soldier and rebels.</seg>
<seg id="69">And both sides always have me within a range of 200 or 300 meters of their sight or optical sensor.</seg>
<seg id="70">I can always well see the faces of the people who approach me, and they can press the triggers on their weapons at any time.</seg>
<seg id="71">Paratrooper and experienced colonel of both German and Ukrainian descent.</seg>
<seg id="72">He considers himself a Russian officer, even though his family (mother) lives in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="73">He thinks Ukraine shouldn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="74">And if so, then as a small colony in a vast Russian Empire.</seg>
<seg id="75">In any case, he keeps talking about it, and he considers Ukraine somehow to be result of a certain misunderstanding.</seg>
<seg id="76">He says such a state should not exist.</seg>
<seg id="77">He is also an unwavering enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.</seg>
<seg id="78">A.cz: Speaking of characters, in a Ukrainian TV discussion show you described your prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, as a weak, clueless and tired "leader" who would do best if he left quickly.</seg>
<seg id="79">In walking three meters, I always become scared at least fivefold.</seg>
<seg id="80">Why should I conceal my opinion that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and is harming our country?</seg>
<seg id="81">A.cz: Do you believe he is a participant in the war in Ukraine?</seg>
<seg id="82">Perhaps you know that the Ukrainians call Yatsenyuk a "rabbit".</seg>
<seg id="83">A rabbit in the eyes of Ukrainians is not an animal that would prompt fear or earn respect and authority from others.</seg>
<seg id="84">His behavior copies the behavior of a rabbit.</seg>
<seg id="85">Maybe he's a good economist, but as a prime minister in a war, he doesn't have the right to cry in Parliament, make requests, play with it using his intrigue and threaten to resign.. he has to lead the country, manage it and protected it during the war.</seg>
<seg id="86">When putting the country at risk, the prime minister is not entitled to a family, friends, rest or crying.</seg>
<seg id="87">After all, he's the prime minister of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="88">And Yatsenyuk?</seg>
<seg id="89">He behaves like a girl in puberty.</seg>
<seg id="90">Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak, because he has never been strong, and he doesn't fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything.</seg>
<seg id="91">Therefore, he should leave.</seg>
<seg id="92">The sooner he does, the better for Ukraine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the box office</seg>
<seg id="2">Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 3 has made back less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while Sin City: A Dame to Kill For has made back only $12 million of its $70 million budget.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Cameron Diaz vehicle Sex Tape took only $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films such as How To Train Your Dragon 2 are also showing disappointing box office returns.</seg>
<seg id="4">An article from Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that, when it comes to children's movies, the poor quality of the films themselves might be to blame.</seg>
<seg id="5">Collin called 2014 the "the worst" year yet for children's films, and described How To Train Your Dragon 2 as a merely "functional" fantasy sequel.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when it comes to film pitched at a slightly older market, it appears that the issue might not necessarily lie with the quality of the films themselves.</seg>
<seg id="7">In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for every summer release playing on at least 2,000 screens between May's Memorial Day holiday and July 20, for 2013 and for this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">The results, which take the opinion of both cinema audiences and film critics into account, suggest that this year's crop of films are of similar calibre last year's hits.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some commentators have suggested that changing viewing habits and the increased popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix may be to blame.</seg>
<seg id="10">Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's forthcoming Jungle Book film, told the website Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."</seg>
<seg id="11">We have to acknowledge that and not try to chase what used to be.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast to Hollywood's current box office slump, Netflix recently saw revenue from its streaming content service reach $1.2bn, almost doubling last year's figure of $837m.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and predicted a Hollywood "meltdown."</seg>
<seg id="14">In light of the current downturn, some commentators are arguing that his dire prophecy may have held some truth to it.</seg>
<seg id="15">With summer 2015 set to usher in a slate of potential big box office hits, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other figures within the film industry are feeling more optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="16">X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the drop in box office takings as simply "cyclical," telling Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest box-office summer in history, and nobody will be worrying about the business."</seg>

<seg id="1">Olomouc took away one point from Opava, and Vašíček had the potential winning goal on his foot.</seg>
<seg id="2">The 23-year-old forward was able to decide, but in his two biggest chances he did not succeed.</seg>
<seg id="3">After the goal, there was mainly a shot from nearby three minutes before the end, but instead of in the net it was caught by Opava goalkeeper Josef Květoňovi.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I had it on my foot, and I have to take advantage of such a chance.</seg>
<seg id="5">I'm angry at myself," Vašíček, dumping ashes onto his head.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I guess I should have shot higher below top of the net," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sigma's defense did not allow Opava much, but an exception was Mikul's shot from the 11th minute, which, however, was blocked by goalkeeper Riechl.</seg>
<seg id="8">Then the Hanáci players began putting on pressure, but the defending home players did not give them a chance, and Květoňovi blocked goal attempts from a distance.</seg>
<seg id="9">We compared for fifteen minutes, and then we took up the initiative.</seg>
<seg id="10">We were already better in the second half, we had more of the game, and Opava posed a threat to us only in standard situations.</seg>
<seg id="11">But Vašíček did not turn around the failed opportunity, and so it ended 0:0," said Hanáků coach Leoše Kalvoda, expressing his disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Opava took the point also due to absences besides two injured players, Petr Vavřík and three-goal shooter Petr Ševčíkem, hosting in Silesia from Sigma, were also missing.</seg>
<seg id="13">That team did not enable them to play, despite its previous policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Substitutes deserve closure.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sigma took more of a soccer-like approach, but except for one standard we did not let them do anything," commented the Silesians' coach, Petr Baránek.</seg>
<seg id="16">A lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and combativeness could be seen.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The draw is probably deserved, because a point for us is a decent gain," he added.</seg>
<seg id="18">With the draw, Sigma got to four points, which means thirteenth place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nothing that could satisfy team head Josef Lébra, who following defeat in a match with Znojmo conditioned his investment of a million on diametrically differing performance in subsequent matches.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We realized Mr. Lébra's warning, so there can be no talk about the guys not wanting to fight," Kalvoda noted, addressing top shooter Vašíček, and he added, "I am confident that the moment will come, and as soon as he shoots a goal, it will start hitting the target.</seg>
<seg id="21">But after the first successful shot, I will replace him immediately, so that he can shoot goals during other games too," Kalvoda said, laughing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Al Pacino has captivated Venice twice.</seg>
<seg id="2">Otherwise, the film festival is experiencing a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Following the major enthusiasm about the starting movie "Birdman", whose director, Alejandro González Iňárritu, was included among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion award, the days that followed gave the impression that interest in the 71-year-old festival in Venice had somewhat faded.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether because the number of seats in the largest theater has increased to 1,400 or because "Birdman" was followed by critically acclaimed, but for viewers less attractive, films such as a documentary about the genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s, "View of Silence", and other films with social themes, from the American movie "99 Homes" to Iranian "Tales", seats still remained empty in cinemas.</seg>
<seg id="5">Comics heroes</seg>
<seg id="6">Even the red carpet in front of the movie palace did not draw as many crowds as in the past, and it reportedly ceased to be a problem to get a hotel room at the last minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">The crisis is being talked about in Italy more than anywhere else, and it's no wonder that it has even affected established events such as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, the crisis does not feature a lack of celebrities, but they have been present only in connection with movies.</seg>
<seg id="9">While young fans have craved autographs of comic super hero actors Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who played the roles successfully in "99 Homes", for all generations without any differences the main event was the visit by the legendary actor Al Pacino.</seg>
<seg id="10">He even appeared immediately in two movies.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the story "Epiphany", screened outside of the competition and filmed by Oscar-winning Barry Levison according to the novel by Phillip Roth, 74-year-old Pacino has a role that is close to him: a highly celebrated actor who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.</seg>
<seg id="12">But seeing him immediately on the second day as the nerdy owner of an ironmongery from a small rural town in the movie "Manglehorn", filmed by David Gordon Green, was truly an unforgettable experience.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Volpi Cup for the best acting performance is not expected to miss him, but does an artist with Pacino's style need prizes?</seg>
<seg id="14">Maybe admiration from the public is the greatest satisfaction for him, especially Italian admiration, since although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his great grandparents originate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Points for Italy</seg>
<seg id="16">Italian film is generally doing very well in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Black Souls", directed by Francesco Munzi, became after "Birdman" the first movie that received a lengthy round of applause.</seg>
<seg id="18">A Calabrese offshoot of the Mafia in it is viewed through family relationships between clans, who are fighting with each other over power and money, and the director managed to fulfill all expectations for a good film: good screenplay, camera shots, music and actors.</seg>
<seg id="19">The psycho thriller "The Hungry Heart", filmed by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who through her fits of rage nearly kills her own child, also received acclaim.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, the competing French films did not enjoy such a warm reception, neither "Ransom for Glory" nor "3 Hearts", both of which follow the traditional model of movies for consumption, which rely on the popularity of acting personalities.</seg>
<seg id="21">But in the end, two really excellent films, "Birdman" and "Black Souls", are not so few for the first half of the festival.</seg>
<seg id="22">And while the festival films have somewhat depressive themes, the new film by Peter Bogdanovich entitled "She's Funny That Way", a humorous comedy shown in Venice outside of the competition and filmed in the style of American comedies from the 1940s, managed to lift everyone's mood for more than a day.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police in Prague have captured four producers of meth, who were bringing medications from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="2">"In the past few days, detectives arrested three men ages 42, 42, and 37 and a woman, 25, who from last November to this August produced and sold meth in Prague 9," said police spokeswoman Jana Rösslerová.</seg>
<seg id="3">First on Tuesday, August 12, the deployment unit on Cihlářské Street caught the 42-year-old organizer and dealer and a young woman, who figured in the group as a buyer of medications in Poland and a seller of doses.</seg>
<seg id="4">Based on prior permission from the state prosecutor, police then arrested another member of the group the next day, a 37-year-old man.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police caught the last of the four in the morning hours of Wednesday, August 20, at the site of the Malešické incineration plant," the spokeswoman said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The woman received a third of the drugs in exchange for bringing in the medications.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main organizer was active in many places.</seg>
<seg id="8">At a workshop in Letná, in a cottage in Horoměřicích, in an apartment on Koněvově Street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced meth, obtained various supplies and chemicals necessary for its production and ensured the transport of drugs containing pseudoephedrine from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="9">He then weighed the produced drug, placed amounts of it in plastic sacks and then sold the meth.</seg>
<seg id="10">A woman, who has yet to be punished, helped him with the transfer of the medications from Poland and with sales to drug users.</seg>
<seg id="11">"She received a third of the produced drugs from the organizer in exchange for her services," Rösslerová added.</seg>
<seg id="12">Based on a court order, law enforcement officials also conducted several home searches, where they found drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, plastic sacks, injection syringes, hoses and other supplies and items, which according to experts can be considered a complete set of supplies for methamphetamine production.</seg>
<seg id="13">The dealer had already been punished seven times since 1995.</seg>
<seg id="14">"From the available evidence, the police discovered that the main organizer had been convicted in court of property crimes a total of seven times since 1995, and the woman had never been convicted," the police spokesperson added.</seg>
<seg id="15">The last man arrested was conditionally sentenced in 2006 for sexual assault, and a 37-year-old auto mechanic, who is not being held in custody during prosecution, has received nine court convictions since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was mostly sentenced for property crimes.</seg>
<seg id="17">The investigator has charged three men and a woman with prohibited production and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they could face up to 10 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="18">"For three persons, the investigator eventually filed a request with the state prosecutor asking that they be remanded into custody, and a judge eventually honored the request and placed them there," said the spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="19">The fourth accused, a 37-year-old recidivist, remains free.</seg>
<seg id="20">His position and role in the activity was not as significant as the other accused.</seg>
<seg id="21">Police are continuing to work with that man.</seg>

<seg id="1">France's Socialists should 'shut up and sort France out', Francois Hollande's key ally says</seg>
<seg id="2">Mr Valls called on the deeply divided Left to "show its affection" for the embattled Socialist president, whose reshuffle has failed to meet the approval of the vast majority of French.</seg>
<seg id="3">The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyality, he deserves our support.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It is our duty to remain at his sides," he said, to applause.</seg>
<seg id="5">As a placatory gesture, the prime minister insisted his government would not call into question France's controversial 35-hour working week, despite inflammatory suggestions it should relax the rules earlier in the week by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Saturday, Mr Hollande had implored his fellow Socialists to remain "united" with the government.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, put a spanner in the works by turning up to a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs and criticising the Socialist Party for letting the French "lose faith in their future."</seg>
<seg id="8">Marine Le Pen, the far-Right National Front leader, heaped scorn on the Socialists' constant in-fighting by saying she did not see the new Valls government lasting more than just a few months.</seg>
<seg id="9">Francois Hollande the Emperor has no clothes, but neither has Prince Manuel Valls, forced to put together a new government when the previous one didn't even survive the summer.</seg>
<seg id="10">"And the new one won't survive the fall or the winter either," Miss Le Pen told supporters.</seg>
<seg id="11">She reiterated her party's call for a parliamentary dissolution, saying she was confident it could win early elections and stood ready to govern.</seg>
<seg id="12">France's ruling party suffered a drubbing in March municipal elections and the far-right National Front came out on top in EU elections in May.</seg>
<seg id="13">A poll in Sunday's Journal du Dimanche found 76 per cent of French believe the Socialist Party risks breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Mr Hollande's presidential term in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="14">Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po university, warned the French would fast lose patience unless the new Socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It has a small window of opportunity, but public opinion needs to quickly feel things are changing," he warned.</seg>

<seg id="2">Amendments to relevant regulations are not expected to be prepared and approved until after the capital city's new leaders take their positions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Additional gambling halls will not disappear from Prague's streets before the municipal elections, and the city will not restrict street art.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even walking dogs will not be restricted.</seg>
<seg id="5">Prague will not manage by the October elections to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant regulations in the City Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Furthermore, the decisions about changes are not expected to be made by the city's current leaders, whose mandate ends in a few weeks," said council member Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).</seg>
<seg id="7">Several local town halls have decided to ban gambling facilities on their territory immediately in recent weeks, such as Prague 5 and 7.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the gambling halls are not going away, and the regulations will not be changed for now.</seg>
<seg id="9">That task will be up to the city's new leaders after the elections.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Right now we would not even technically be able to manage it in time, because of, for example, the deadlines for submitting feedback, etc." Manhart explained.</seg>
<seg id="11">He pointed out that the last session of the current City Council, which must approve the change, will take place on September 11.</seg>
<seg id="12">A referendum on a total ban on gambling halls will take place on the day of the municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is currently a ban on gambling halls in locations such as Prague 2 and Prague 12.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the same reasons, the regulation will not be changed even for street art, known as busking.</seg>
<seg id="15">That activity has been complained about mainly by Prague 1, which has already sent City Hall a proposed list of locations which it would like to add to the locations where it is already banned.</seg>
<seg id="16">Prague 5 does not want musicians near Anděla either.</seg>
<seg id="17">A directive that would regulate dog walking has been planned by the city for several months, but its preparation is not yet finished.</seg>
<seg id="18">Locations of gambling halls and the issue of busking are being resolved by municipal decrees.</seg>
<seg id="19">They can be issued and amended only by the Prague City Council.</seg>

<seg id="1">Last week, supporters of Scottish independence were in reach of a victory.</seg>
<seg id="2">The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making the same mistake three times, when it almost placed billboards all over Scotland asking if Scots wanted to be rich.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, you will not win over the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, and you will not even gain their respect when you start threatening them.</seg>
<seg id="4">The morals in the New Testament are still very relevant in Scotland, even though only a small number of Scots still go to church.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scots have a much greater tendency to push money changers out of their houses of worship rather than allowing others to dictate to them how they should vote.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Scottish nationalists' leader, Alex Salmond, knows this very well, and therefore in the television discussion he repeatedly asked his rival, unionist Darling, whether he would be willing to respect "the sovereign will of the Scottish people," if Scottish voters chose independence, and whether he would begin supporting a single currency for Scotland as well as for England.</seg>
<seg id="7">This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London bankers, and this situation made him grimace.</seg>
<seg id="8">Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of Scottish voters.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although this discussion about what currency Scotland would have has been more or less neutralized.</seg>
<seg id="10">What really motivates Scottish voters are fairness, job opportunities and protection of the state health care system, which citizens enjoy free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Regarding the issue of the currency, Darling has supported London bankers and has also created the impression that he will not protest against privatization of health care.</seg>
<seg id="12">In doing so, Salmond said, "Get in bed with Conservatives."</seg>
<seg id="13">That is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.</seg>
<seg id="14">Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with Conservatives.</seg>
<seg id="15">This has been confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke in Scotland not to voters, but to an association of "bosses", the Confederation of British Industry.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to debate about independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a major mistake for the unionist campaign.</seg>
<seg id="17">It makes Cameron look like a cowardly absentee at home.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cameron at least managed to say that Scotland could be "a successful independent country".</seg>
<seg id="20">Alistair Darling cannot manage to say anything like that, and it almost causes him physical pain.</seg>
<seg id="21">What he is sharing is clear: Scots shouldn't jump up and down and must accept things as they are.</seg>

<seg id="5">The end was the best part of the vacation period, the last week, when nothing went anywhere any more and we just whiled away the hours during Indian summer, the calm before the storm, the quiet before the storm, the calm before stress.</seg>
<seg id="6">New clothes, when they could be found at Tuzex, and shoes from East Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reading "Rapid Arrows" for the fiftieth time, swishing on our bikes around the Imperial all the way to behind Karlovy Vary, somewhere towards tennis courts, when it was no longer hot and the sun shined on our backs and shoulders and patted them with parting rays.</seg>
<seg id="8">Slight nervousness in the evening, still in vacation mode, sleeping until half past ten, but in a week it will be worse, and shortly before falling asleep time stretches from a couple of minutes to two hours, followed by getting up at half past six in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="9">Monday will come.</seg>
<seg id="10">Usually it won't rain, but instead summer sneers in an evil manner before school.</seg>

<seg id="13">There are the bullies, so avoid them, though it's still interesting how they always stick together and how they are here so early.</seg>
<seg id="14">And those grown-up-looking girls, who came shyly, are now giggling about something hysterically, indicating that something must have changed in their lives during vacation, while everything is still the same for me.</seg>
<seg id="15">And what about the new first-graders, some of them nervous and others excited, why are they coming over here at all?</seg>
<seg id="16">Because they have to, as if school were like compulsory military service.</seg>
<seg id="17">So as we enter, we sense the cool dampness of the floor, the slight odor of disinfectant, the annoyed janitor with a mop, unfortunately still the same one, who reportedly lends students a key to a metal locker, where textbooks can be left and of which there are still so few.</seg>
<seg id="18">For a bottle.</seg>
<seg id="19">The stench of the locker rooms is stuck in memory, but now it isn't present, because the location has been well ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.</seg>
<seg id="20">Just imagining it turns one's stomach and initiates a headache.</seg>
<seg id="21">A head that even worse handles math lessons, the devilish game for the chosen ones, among whom I don't belong and never will.</seg>
<seg id="22">Satisfactory and poor grades again or, God forbid, failing grades, hiding from tests, sitting down in the chair and zoning out as much as possible, being there and not being there, existing only as a name on the attendance sheet and dreaming up stories about more loving girls and starry buildings, antennas reaching into space, where no one competes with anyone, no one puts anyone down and no one trips you up.</seg>

<seg id="1">She let her unborn daughters die.</seg>
<seg id="2">She may face an exceptional sentence - Novinky.cz</seg>
<seg id="3">The first birth occurred in March 2012 in a public restroom stall at the bus station in Jihlava.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without anyone else's help, she gave birth to a small girl, and after cutting off her umbilical cord she placed the baby in a prepared blanket, hid the child under her jacket and took her to a side road, where she left her in the bushes just a few dozen meters from the roadway.</seg>
<seg id="5">She gave birth on the way to school.</seg>
<seg id="6">It happened a little early.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I was on the way to school.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the bus, I felt like I needed to go to the restroom, and that's where I gave birth.</seg>
<seg id="9">She was born live and looked at me.</seg>
<seg id="10">I cut off the umbilical cord with scissors, which I was carrying to school," the accused said, adding that she was ashamed to be pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="11">"On the next day, she returned to the location, placed the child's body in a backpack and carried it away, then removed the body from the backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it under the stairway at her grandmother's home in Havlíčkobrodsku" the lawsuit reads, adding that it is not entirely clear when the newborn's death occurred.</seg>
<seg id="12">It could have been within fifteen minutes to half an hour, but even several hours after birth, through suffocation by the blanket or during placement beneath the jacket, freezing to death or bleeding from the unbandaged abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="13">A similar incident occurred next year in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="14">The woman at an unclear time between February and April 12, when the child's body was found by passersby below the bushes near a pond in Havlíčkobrodsku, again gave birth by herself in secret.</seg>
<seg id="15">This time in the bathroom of an attic apartment in a family house.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even without checking whether the child had been born alive and even without cutting the umbilical cord, which was stretched around the neck, she placed the child into several pieces of plastic wrapping, including a plastic bag, and left her in the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then in the afternoon hours, she and her partner at the time took the child to a pond.</seg>
<seg id="18">The boyfriend eventually turned her in</seg>
<seg id="19">Both children's father was the defendant's boyfriend, who, however, reportedly didn't know about his partner's pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's another reason why he's not currently facing court proceedings, because he was punished for a misdemeanor violation legislation governing funerals.</seg>
<seg id="21">He was also the one who later contacted police.</seg>
<seg id="22">I don't like that he is not being punished as an accomplice.</seg>
<seg id="23">He manipulated with the child against my wishes.</seg>
<seg id="24">I know that my solution was not right, but at the time it seemed humane to me," the accused, who allegedly submitted to the man in the relationship and was afraid of him, said, not hiding her anger.</seg>
<seg id="25">During her testimony, the young woman spoke relatively calmly.</seg>
<seg id="26">She didn't begin crying until she started talking about her relationship with her parents, from whom she had left after reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="27">She said she didn't want to kill.</seg>
<seg id="28">"They have been visiting me every 14 days, and they are doing everything they can for me, even though I know that I don't deserve it," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I didn't get baby clothes, because I didn't want children, I thought I was too young.</seg>
<seg id="30">I kept wanting to put the child in a baby box, but I don't know what happened or why I didn't do that.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's something I can't explain to you," she said in response to the judge.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, she denied that she had acted with the intention to kill the newborn.</seg>
<seg id="33">She said furthermore that the second child had been born dead.</seg>
<seg id="34">She had not stopped drinking alcohol even during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="35">"But I limited it.</seg>
<seg id="36">And I didn't drink hard liquor.</seg>
<seg id="37">And I limited smoking too," she said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Although her pregnancy was visible in both cases, she always claimed repeatedly in response to questions that she had health problems and was retaining water.</seg>
<seg id="39">She even told this to her boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="40">The main hearing will continue at the court in Hradec on Tuesday with testimony from court experts.</seg>
<seg id="41">The verdict could be handed down as early as Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="42">The woman could face up to 18 years in prison or even an exceptional punishment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demands Kiev open 'statehood' talks with eastern Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease battling separatists in the country's east and immediately begin negotiations on the breakaway region's "statehood," according to Russian news accounts of his remarks.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin didn't mean to imply that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Putin's call upon the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russia insurgents as equals corresponded with the apparent strategy he has followed since the violence began five months ago: Help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region virtual independence to align with Russia instead of the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with state-run Channel One television, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to recover separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were seized in March and April, after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have lately branded the seized territory "Novorossiya," or "New Russia," a term that harkens to pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin said that anyone who believed peace talks are in the offing as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns for an Oct. 26 parliamentary election and while government troops are attacking civilian communities in separatist-held regions is "a prisoner to illusions," Itar-Tass reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately commence substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the statehood status of southeast Ukraine in order to serve the interests of people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood was meant in the context of the broader autonomy that has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership as it struggles to allay fears in the Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's not a matter to be negotiated between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it's not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Kremlin spokesman's intercession to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the Russian leadership's approach to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east differently from its outright seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have a much more difficult fight to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian and pre-conflict polls showed broad support for staying within Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would grant regional governments in Ukraine the authority to determine their own trade agreements and foreign relations, effectively handing the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago is home to Russia's main naval fleet as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic coastal resorts.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between Russia's Rostov area and Crimea are also home to mines, factories and foundries that produce vital components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections -- weigh constitutional amendments to give more control to the disparate regions over their finances and the status of languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But his vision of autonomy appears to differ sharply from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels Moscow is accused of arming and instigating.</seg>
<seg id="19">Putin's latest call on Kiev to deal with the separatist leaders as equals followed new advances by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Russian-backed separatists took control of the town of Novoazovsk in a drive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the opening of a campaign to seize the strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">That has spurred a massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a steelmaking port of 500,000 that lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway into the Crimean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to urge action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are close to the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The EU summit took no definitive action; the leaders called for drafting more punishing sanctions on Russia to be imposed in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armor and 1,000 troops last week moved into the Donetsk region to bolster the beleaguered separatists, Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="27">The first of a reported 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped in Ilovaysk by the Russian incursion were swapped Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured inside Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sigma reconciles with Lébra, even without victory</seg>
<seg id="2">Olomouc - the thunder and lightning that co-owner of Sigma Olomouc, Josef Lébra, unleashed on his subordinates last week seem to be over.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is despite the fact that from Opava they eventually brought away only one point for a goalless draw.</seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore, the team boss reconciled just a little with the team's efforts and combativeness.</seg>
<seg id="5">The money for payouts is expected to come to the team soon.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I will keep one more game, as I spoke about last week, but I'm already much more optimistic," Lébra confirmed, explained that although Sigma had not won, the players convinced him with their improved performance.</seg>
<seg id="7">The combativeness and efforts with which we played mainly in the second half were exactly what I want to see from players.</seg>
<seg id="8">In such situation, I am able to forgive them for not winning.</seg>
<seg id="9">If we had played that way from the start of the season, then I am convinced that we wouldn't have lost," Lébra said.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Opava, Sigma put a stop to the initial pressure from the home team, and then it balanced the game, and in the second half it was already better.</seg>
<seg id="11">Following victory, Kalvoda's entrusted players exerted efforts, but they did not achieve any goals, and so they couldn't win.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The result is not what we expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">But for complete satisfaction, we were missing only one transformed opportunity," said Lébra, who believes, however, that the change in the players' approach was caused only by his threat.</seg>
<seg id="14">"There were certainly multiple aspects.</seg>
<seg id="15">Both from my side and from the side of the coach or fans," Lébra said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sigma has to anticipate pressure.</seg>
<seg id="17">After the game in Opava, the players did not want to comment much regarding the events from last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">"I'm trying to put these things completely behind me.</seg>
<seg id="19">I have tried not to concede the situation," young goalkeeper Michal Reichl said, shaking his head.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lébra's statement from last week was left entirely without comment by offensive player Václav Vašíček, who did not fulfill Sigma's biggest opportunity in the Saturday game.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, he eventually spoke about it just a little.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We'll always be under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="23">Everyone wants to tear us apart.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today we demonstrated that if we fight and kick everyone's ass, then it works," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">They took the warning to heart.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not hesitate to say that the preparation for the game were not the easiest, given the atmosphere that was present in Olomouc last week.</seg>
<seg id="27">It was very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="28">But I think that the boys realized that, and today it was clear that they had taken Mr. Lébra's warning to heart.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is true although even previously they did not want to fight and they slacked off," the Olomouc coach said.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It was similar to today in the first fifteen minutes.</seg>
<seg id="31">It lasted until we came to terms with the toughness and realized what a second league is all about.</seg>
<seg id="32">That it's not about soccer, but mainly about fighting," Kalvoda said.</seg>
<seg id="33">All that is left to do is hope that in the next games things will work for Sigma from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I would really like to believe that," he added.</seg>
