<seg id="1">This is perfectly illustrated by the UKIP numbties banning people with HIV.</seg>
<seg id="2">You mean Nigel Farage saying the NHS should not be used to pay for people coming to the UK as health tourists, and saying yes when the interviewer specifically asked if, with the aforementioned in mind, people with HIV were included in not being welcome.</seg>
<seg id="3">You raise a straw man and then knock it down with thinly veiled homophobia.</seg>
<seg id="4">Every time I or my family need to use the NHS we have to queue up behind bigots with a sense of entitlement and chronic hypochondria.</seg>
<seg id="5">I think the straw man is yours.</seg>
<seg id="6">Health tourism as defined by the right wing loonies is virtually none existent.</seg>
<seg id="7">I think it's called democracy.</seg>
<seg id="8">So no one would be affected by UKIP's policies against health tourism so no problem.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only in UKIP La La Land could Carswell be described as revolutionary.</seg>
<seg id="10">Quoting the bollox The Daily Muck spew out is not evidence.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ah, shoot the messenger.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Mail didn't write the report, it merely commented on it.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever controls most of the media in this country should undead be shot for spouting populist propaganda as fact.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think you know what a straw man is.</seg>
<seg id="15">You also don't know anything about my personal circumstances or identity so I would be very careful about trying to eradicate a debate with accusations of homophobia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Farage's comment came as quite a shock, but only because it is so rarely addressed.</seg>
<seg id="17">He did not express any homophobic beliefs whatsoever.</seg>
<seg id="18">You will just have to find a way of getting over it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say, but my guess is that you dislike the media reporting things you disagree with.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is so rarely addressed because unlike Fararge and his Thatcherite loony disciples who think aids and floods are a signal from the divine and not a reflection on their own ignorance in understanding the complexities of humanity as something to celebrate,then no.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the end the situation is just as bad in Ireland as it is in Spain.</seg>
<seg id="2">With the new crisis coming, the period of austerity will not have fixed anything.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hoping for almost 5% growth in 2015 is a real joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ireland, the "EUROPEAN TIGER" they used to speak highly of to us years ago.</seg>
<seg id="5">We know the rest!</seg>
<seg id="6">It is starting again when you read this article.</seg>
<seg id="7">They're trying to pretend that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a "NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE" is happening.</seg>
<seg id="8">With the agreement of Brussels, the lowest taxes on companies in Europe, a very flexible labor market, continuing emigration.</seg>
<seg id="9">With these ingredients, there is nothing to "crow about" for the time being with the arrival of the Poles.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the 80s in the twentieth century, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, along with Portugal. Considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is still better than it ever was.</seg>
<seg id="11">Greece was ahead.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is clear that their development was not a long quiet river, given the recent events.</seg>
<seg id="13">The lowest taxes in Europe?</seg>
<seg id="14">That is not correct!</seg>
<seg id="15">Latvia has a 0% tax rate for companies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now there is real hypocrisy in France from politicians on the taxes that multinationals really pay.</seg>
<seg id="17">If we believe a report released in 2008 or 2009, they generally pay less than 5% in France.</seg>
<seg id="18">Only SMEs pay the full lot.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars on every street corner, exactly like before the 2008 crisis.</seg>

<seg id="10">I've never flown Ryanair and the last 3 times I flew I went BA.</seg>
<seg id="11">I prefer my airlines to offer me customer service.</seg>
<seg id="12">No, but its Ryanair, so they can have a pop.</seg>
<seg id="13">Any article about Ryanair attracts dozens of comments from people who would never fly Ryanair, to those who like flying Ryanair and think anyone paying anything more than the basic fare has only themselves to blame, etc.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's pretty transparent.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ryanair are not going to be happy about the extra cost involved in this incident.</seg>
<seg id="16">I wonder how long the delays will be and will compensation to passengers by due and if so, can Ryanair then get out of paying as they can say it was the airport air traffic controllers error.</seg>

<seg id="1">Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: le Marais is largely pedestrianized, and is literally swarming with people.</seg>
<seg id="2">The people have not come en masse for the quality of the restaurants (ordinary, for the most part) or for the Journal fair at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly outmoded).</seg>
<seg id="3">The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the area is incredibly lively and animated.</seg>
<seg id="4">With a lot of foreigners who spend...</seg>
<seg id="5">Do you think that opening on Sundays is going to create jobs?</seg>
<seg id="6">Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, full of people with 50% tourists.</seg>
<seg id="7">@aloes False!</seg>
<seg id="8">The only argument that would seem admissible to me is the one of the areas that receive a significant number of foreign tourists and this is nuanced by the fact that they are buying tax-free.</seg>
<seg id="9">Tourist areas lose a considerable amount of sales revenue each year for the same reasons.</seg>
<seg id="10">The industry remains, where expensive equipment, used on Sunday, makes it possible to lower prices.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sunday rest is a right that employees, besides exceptions, enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="12">That's the reason why it is provided for and regulated by the labor code.</seg>
<seg id="13">Neither the ministry responsible for the economy, nor, moreover, the one responsible for foreign affairs, have the slightest competence to reform the labor code.</seg>
<seg id="14">So they should shut up.</seg>
<seg id="15">What use is the law?</seg>
<seg id="16">To satisfy a part of the population and the companies who want to work on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Montreal on Sunday afternoon, I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.</seg>
<seg id="18">In my Town with 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France, the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not at the weekend!</seg>
<seg id="19">That is access to culture...</seg>
<seg id="20">And that is also the regulation of working times.</seg>

<seg id="11">But for 5 years, and five years only mind, he was perfect.</seg>
<seg id="12">He stood against his fellow aristos in Government in 1940 who wanted to discuss ' terms' with the nazis and very cleverly saw them off.</seg>
<seg id="13">By dint of his magnificent oratory and energy he brought this country together to understand that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.</seg>
<seg id="14">The people of the Uk , and France, and Belgium and ultimately the rest of the world can thank god, that for those five years, just those five years, Churchill was at the helm, and no other.</seg>
<seg id="15">The greatness of Churchill is irrelevant to this debate.</seg>
<seg id="16">Let his descendants sell the paintings on the open market to raise the money for IHT, they might even make a profit.</seg>

<seg id="1">A relaunch of the internal market by public works will only favor large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, the infrastructure sites by definition are not very renewable.</seg>

<seg id="13">Today, in Europe and in France, this is not the case.</seg>

<seg id="15">The need for infrastructure is marginal, therefore in no way would a new deal be a solution.</seg>

<seg id="17">You would have been right 30 years ago: greater need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, motorways...</seg>
<seg id="18">But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investment is glaring: insulation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, energy transport and storage, etc.</seg>

<seg id="1">Could our friends from the UMP who, according to one of them, combat ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course the Parisian bohos) tell us which author's/s' ideas on gender they are combating and specify exactly which works that they are intending to combat.</seg>
<seg id="2">Or do they just attack gender as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Valeurs Actuelles?</seg>
<seg id="3">Are their sources Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?</seg>
<seg id="4">Well, Jean, I like you a lot, and you are someone who is intelligent and cultured.</seg>
<seg id="5">I said that about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holofernes, a parallel which did not occur to me (I do not have her sharpness of mind).</seg>
<seg id="6">Otherwise, all things considered, as you refer to it, this subject does not interest me, and, sincerely, I cannot see where the problem is: I would hope that you and your friends could get me out of my retardation, as I am slow but I understand well...</seg>

<seg id="16">@: As it was about a debate of ideas, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.</seg>
<seg id="17">Intending to combat ideas from the only report that their critics make of it (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Gender Theory, or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me to be very rigorous.</seg>
<seg id="18">But anyway, as I was explaining to our friend from the UMP, that is the difference between having an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">I am not sure, however, that he has understood the nuance.</seg>

<seg id="9">I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to manage a company and this choice enables me to lay into hopeless bosses, who I come across frequently.</seg>
<seg id="10">Feeling very comfortable, I fully share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he is telling the horrible truth!</seg>
<seg id="11">@gus, if we make a comparison with German companies, the French business leaders are constantly quoted as demanding reforms in France, while in Germany, companies knew how to structure their industrial framework to make it competitive, particularly by ensuring the link between large, medium and small companies. What are French bosses waiting for to do the same??</seg>

<seg id="17">@ Pat I understand your reaction.</seg>
<seg id="18">In fact, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders incapable of creating jobs and who sulk and simper waiting for the permanent help from the State!</seg>
<seg id="19">It's terrible!</seg>
<seg id="20">But they do have some solutions: abolition of the Labor Code, employer contributions, taxes, working 45hours/week paid for 35, and some, walking on egg shells, dare to call for the reduction of salaries if not their abolition!</seg>

<seg id="3">Assuming that the fact of being a "fighter" is a quality more superior to many others, the worry of others, intelligence, listening, for example, the fact of being a "fighter" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancer patients who are "fighters", who are nevertheless not dead, I know loads of them.</seg>

<seg id="9">I'll start over.</seg>
<seg id="10">To insinuate, if only for a moment, that one can deserve to get over an illness or that one can not deserve to get over it, is quite simply monstrous.</seg>
<seg id="11">The body follows or it does not follow.</seg>
<seg id="12">A body which lets go, all over, in spite of will, in spite of confidence in the medicine, do you have the vaguest idea of what that means?</seg>
<seg id="13">Sorry to think the opposite, if, having a strong morale enables one to accept tough treatments more easily and to prepare oneself for them, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not to refuse them because of fear...</seg>
<seg id="14">Someone who is fighting in medicine, is above all someone who trusts medicine...</seg>

<seg id="3">What's going on?</seg>
<seg id="4">It's an anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="5">A forgotten one.</seg>
<seg id="6">His trial was brought to an end "swiftly" and then swept under the carpet.</seg>
<seg id="7">Was this the story that was told back then?</seg>
<seg id="8">Communist-turned-nationalist who ignited three Balkan wars in the past decade?</seg>
<seg id="9">Communist president of a Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?</seg>
<seg id="10">Please, question the facts that are conveniently missed out: 1.</seg>
<seg id="11">Explain how NATO bombing was legal under ANY norms of international law.</seg>
<seg id="12">What country did Serbia attack?</seg>
<seg id="13">When talking about RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia) why do you fail to mention how NATO blew up that same building killing civilians and then deemed it a valid target.</seg>
<seg id="14">Milosevic was done however one flips the coin: If he didn't defend his country against NATO attack he would get crucified as a traitor.</seg>
<seg id="15">If he did, he would get eaten up by western justice system.</seg>
<seg id="16">Westerners deemed false flag and detached part of a sovereign state witch later unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was expressly recognized by western states who proceeded to flat out lie about situation on the ground.</seg>

<seg id="1">As far as I know, only in Greece is there an earthquake prediction method that works more or less, by measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.</seg>
<seg id="2">This type of study is indisputably useful and thank you for sharing the results with us.</seg>
<seg id="3">A hope therefore, but caution should be exercised. This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years away from Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which is "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study led by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine's team from the University of Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="4">The method to be followed then.</seg>
<seg id="5">Just like those which involve animals feeling threatened.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thank you Passeur de sciences for treating us, often, to these experimental feats which are achieved in the world.</seg>
<seg id="7">How would animals know (in advance)?</seg>
<seg id="8">Undoubtedly by the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the event of an earthquake.</seg>
<seg id="9">Like radon, for example.</seg>
<seg id="10">An odorless gas a priori for man but may be detected by animals.</seg>
<seg id="11">All these methods are undetectable by man, but not for the measuring instruments which they have at their disposal.</seg>
<seg id="12">But we do not have reliable results on these clues...</seg>
<seg id="13">It was observed many a time (and for centuries) that certain animals act in a strange way for a few hours with an earthquake, particularly hens, cows, dogs, but especially fish and snakes.</seg>
<seg id="14">I had seen a report on the arte channel telling of the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to ensure the recognition of the validity of their work which was about animals' sensitivity to earth's magnetic fields, and more particularly about their modification before an earthquake.</seg>
<seg id="15">Well of course I am not a scientist, but their hypotheses had convinced me!</seg>
<seg id="16">How far have we got on this research?</seg>
<seg id="17">Why so much contempt towards this line of research?</seg>
<seg id="18">We should learn how to listen to nature again...</seg>
<seg id="19">If one examines things calmly and rigorously, one publishes it in a serious journal, and no one looks down on it.</seg>
<seg id="20">As soon as we talk about "signs" given by animals, we come up against the same slant: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the goldfish was strangely going round in circles.</seg>

<seg id="4">Bajevic was a midfielder or forward in the 70s and 80s, and coach of many teams in Greece, but I dunno where from.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia & Herzegovina, and played as a striker for the great Velez side that, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, twice finished as runners-up in the Yugoslav league (and also included such luminaries as Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsene Wenger's trusty side-kick Boro Primorac).</seg>

<seg id="1">How can one have felt "an explosion of joy" seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and undoubtedly children were inside?</seg>
<seg id="2">How??</seg>
<seg id="3">What bothers me a little in this "account", is the mere fact of having been able to, even if it was just once, be spontaneously delighted at the horrible death of thousands of people; in my eyes it bears witness to a "border line" personality, all the "accounts" of whom should be taken with the highest circumspection.</seg>
<seg id="4">No doubt that in the short moment of "joy", one will not have thought of the dead nor the reality of the horror inflicted.</seg>

<seg id="8">It would seem that this sentiment has been shared by thousands of Muslims consumed by their feeling of humiliation.</seg>

<seg id="10">Classic Schadenfreude.</seg>

<seg id="12">The West "Christian/white/Gauls" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when he contemplates the general poverty, social and cultural under-development of the Arab-Muslim world today.</seg>

<seg id="14">The former splendor, certainly glorified is no consolation, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="15">How can the Muslim world get out of this diabolical hole?</seg>
<seg id="16">Entirely in agreement, 2 major poisons run through the Arab World I: the bigoted conservatism of the powers in authority and fascistic nihilism.</seg>
<seg id="17">The thing in common, the suspension of thought and the excommunication (gentle or armed) of their critical expression.</seg>

<seg id="1">Would a genuine territorial policy not be better to clear Paris and dynamize the rest of France?</seg>
<seg id="2">Personally, I cannot see the inhabitants of the very depths of Essonne and the Val-d'Oise doing 80km there and back every day by bicycle to come to work in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="3">The inhabitants from the inner city and the inner ring road already have many much more practical means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).</seg>
<seg id="4">> Several secured and locked parks, as already exist in cities in the North of Europe, in Dijon or in Lyon, will be installed on the roads.</seg>
<seg id="5">Good idea.</seg>

<seg id="11">Well, that is no good at all.</seg>
<seg id="12">When you argue with pedestrians and other public transport users about the reasons why they do not pedal, it seems to me that the principal reasons which stand out are: 1/ it is so dangerous with all these cars, lorries, scooters which drive extremely fast and do not give a damn about the survival of bicycles 2/ we take a lot of pollution into our body. For me cycling lanes are a last resort, car traffic must be reduced (urban toll like a congestion charge), speed reduced (Paris = 30 zone), enforce the highway code by systematically booking offenders (even for bicycles except that it is necessary to adapt the highway code written for cars 100 years ago to bicycles), extend the buffer zones after the zebra crossings, not before, otherwise cars and scooters do not interfere with each other.</seg>
<seg id="13">Cycling lanes is apartheid, we must co-exist but balance the occupation of urban space.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nothing on bicycles in greater Paris?</seg>
<seg id="15">Not a word on bicycle spaces on public transport?</seg>
<seg id="16">EELV is right.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rather disappointed by this opening to season 4 and particularly by Jessica Lange who visibly found it difficult to find her double character, Marlene Dietrich.</seg>
<seg id="2">I have just watched the last two seasons, which are quite different, but I must admit that it is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!</seg>
<seg id="3">A fascinating first episode.</seg>
<seg id="4">The production is close to perfection and the show with Jessica Lange singing the anachronistic Life on Mars by Bowie is quite simply amazing.</seg>
<seg id="5">I haven't watched this new series yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange meh).</seg>
<seg id="6">In the case of American Horror Story I preferred to watch it all in one go to watching 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">But one thing is sure, apart from extraordinary Jessica Lange, it is above all the risks in the staging and editing which stagger me.</seg>
<seg id="8">In AHS we have an avalanche of original shots which ridicule the aseptization of today's productions quite well.</seg>
<seg id="9">I don't quite understand why you throw in the towel in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jessica Lange is certainly one of the mainstays in this series, but, as you said so well, there are many other things.</seg>
<seg id="11">No, it is simply that, for me, Jessica Lange (and above all her voice and the way in which she uses it) is truly ONE of the pillars of the series apart from some technical qualities.</seg>
<seg id="12">And well I watch it a lot for her.</seg>
<seg id="13">Then I find that the series is flawed by its writing, it wants to do too many things at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Season 3 was slightly below par, in the 2nd it was too fragmented despite some excellent episodes.</seg>
<seg id="15">I do not see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it is going to finish like 24 otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="16">But anyway everyone does what they want to, eh!</seg>
<seg id="17">It is not because I say "I will not watch anymore afterwards" that everyone is obliged to do the same!</seg>
<seg id="18">I simply share my point of view, nothing more, nothing less.</seg>
<seg id="19">The loss of Jessica Lange, I think that it will be fatal for it.</seg>
<seg id="20">But, after all, this is just my opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Less talk of tax rises, please - just get on with slashing state spending.</seg>
<seg id="2">No, let's increase spending please.</seg>
<seg id="3">The slashers have failed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Picking noisy fights over relatively modest chunks of expenditure, such as foreign aid</seg>
<seg id="5">The problem is that it is less than the margin of error for Government expenditure in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reality is that we are all talking about a differnece in emphasis rather than the change in direction that voters appear to want and all the while some on all sides pretend that the difference is emphasis is something much more significant and substantial - and the voters see through that as being disingenuous.</seg>
<seg id="7">Less than 1pc of managed expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="8">The "debt" are assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "debt" is nothing to panic about.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would be relaxed about the government appropriating one third of my income (before we get on to taxes on spending) if I felt it would use it wisely.</seg>
<seg id="11">But I don't and many taxpayers feel the same.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nigel Farage is alleged to be less than honest about how taxes can be reduced but then again if you add up our EU net contribution, overseas aid, HS2, subsidies to near-useless wind farms and nuclear power stations that cost double what they should you come to a figure that makes Labour's / Lib-Dem's mansion tax seem very small beer.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your first £10,000 is tax free.</seg>
<seg id="14">This means that someone earning £35,000 a year will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone on £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (a fifth), etc, and someone on £200,000 pays around £70,000 (just over a third).</seg>
<seg id="15">National insurance?</seg>
<seg id="16">Plus national insurance, plus council tax, plus parking charges and road tax, and that's before VAT.</seg>
<seg id="17">Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken at source before council tax and road tax.</seg>
<seg id="18">I'm decently paid, but not wildly so.</seg>
<seg id="19">Not that this is wrong, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.</seg>

<seg id="1">How can an unemployed person who is looking for work door to door prove it?</seg>
<seg id="2">Even though 20% of unemployed people were not looking, that means that 80% are looking and don't find anything.</seg>
<seg id="3">As an unemployed person myself, would it be better for me if the others look or not?</seg>
<seg id="4">If a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs, that increases my chances in proportion.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, I haven't had any news from the employment center for months; that means that the agents are busier with monitoring operations than with bringing back job advertisements?</seg>
<seg id="6">I don't see the interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">Because it is not up to the State to provide the jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">If the employment center does not provide enough posts, then one must do without the employment center.</seg>
<seg id="9">How is this a sensitive subject?</seg>
<seg id="10">We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that unemployed people fulfill their duties in return for their rights.</seg>
<seg id="11">Just like a conductor asks for transport tickets from users of transport, or a head of department the employees about their work, etc.</seg>
<seg id="12">No one calls it a scandal in this case, right?</seg>
<seg id="13">It is indeed good to recall that unemployed people have rights: the only two times that I have dealt with the employment center, my rights to the ARE were badly established, and on one of the files, cut drastically by 40%, it was necessary to fight a tough battle.</seg>
<seg id="14">That takes time!</seg>
<seg id="15">I am not an expert on law.</seg>
<seg id="16">Recording information and monitoring take precedence now, while statutorily the employment center is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.</seg>
<seg id="17">I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, they are the ones who pay the contributions.</seg>
<seg id="18">Politicians and French non-employees grant themselves rights which they do not in fact have!</seg>
<seg id="19">This is not normal.</seg>
<seg id="20">I would add that a decent unemployment insurance contributes to the improved status of employed work.</seg>

<seg id="12">If the SNP win 20-25 seats in a hung parliament situation, even if the seats don't come from the Tories, then they are in a very powerful bargaining position in terms of any coalition and a threat to both the Tories and Labour in terms of making them do what they'd say about devo max.</seg>

<seg id="1">It's about a lot more than Russell Brand as well, yet the Guardian's writers seem to struggle to get beyond anything he doesn't have to say.</seg>
<seg id="2">A lot of what he says is ghostwritten sub-Chomskyian woo</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows you don't understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.</seg>
<seg id="4">Just a collection of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes him, implying it's to do with immaturity).</seg>
<seg id="5">A really mean spirited attack, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is speaking some truth, maybe a truth that is too much to think about.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hold on to your hat, there's going to be a lot more of this sentiment coming!</seg>
<seg id="7">I can understand why Brand rubs some people up the wrong way - can be pretentious in his delivery and after all the tabloid nonsense he does come across as a johnny-come-lately populist, but this whole not voting thing has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.</seg>
<seg id="8">The general consensus seems to be that he is just telling people not to vote and to put their feet up instead and ignore the whole political process - but if you watch the Paxman interview and other articles/videos he's posted, he's saying merely voting once every 5 years for Labour or Conservative (or the Lib Dems I guess) and limiting democratic engagement to that is completely pointless, as both parties (to slightly differing extents) are basically ruling for vested interests, corporate multi-nationals and the wealthy, At no point does he just say ignore politics completely as these parties aren't ruling in our name - he makes a big point of saying that instead of merely voting and switching off for 5 years, people should become far more politically active from a grassroots level, agitate, protest, petition, whatever and try to influence politics from this level.</seg>
<seg id="9">I'm not saying I necessarily agree with his solution (as I think being politically active in terms of making demands can go hand in hand with voting as politicians are a fickle lot who will change their tune if there is a real prospect of them being voted out of office), but it is annoying seeing all these patronising responses saying the silly Jesus man is telling the youth to not bother voting and just hope for the best as it is mis-representing his argument.</seg>
<seg id="10">His solution is extremely debatable, and it would be nice if people would debate what he actually means rather than just label him irresponsible and sideline the concerns that he and a huge amount of disenfranchised people hold.</seg>
<seg id="11">Yes - thank you.</seg>
<seg id="12">The voting thing has been entirely misrepresented.</seg>
<seg id="13">I deeply resent the pointlessness of a cross on a piece of paper every 5 years when my vote doesn't even bloody well count.</seg>
<seg id="14">I want more referenda on issues, voting by hole in the wall technology, direct democracy and MPs locally accountable to the electorate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, I take issue with the suggestion that Russell Brand's words are not his own (ghostwritten).</seg>
<seg id="16">He's intelligent enough to come up with his own words and ideas, even if they have been heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment, countercultural thinkers and academics that Suzanne would happily lump into one "sub-Chomskyian woo" box.</seg>
<seg id="17">I'm pretty sure he'd get Suzanne onside in a conversation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maybe that's what teh Guardian could do, get Suzanne to do a Polly Toynbee and to interview Russell on a veranda complete with nodding responses edited in!</seg>
<seg id="19">Like Max Keiser, who started out baiting Russel but ended up a fan, inviting him on his show, it's all too easy to attack him without really getting where he's coming from.</seg>
<seg id="20">He taps into a political narrative that exists through the generations, but which has been marginalised by mainstream media - including the Guardian - for generations.</seg>

<seg id="1">This "rebellion" reveals above all to my mind that intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the History Meetings, where professional historians have become the minority and where exchanges among specialists have become poorer to the benefit of condensed ready-made thinking typical of Political Sciences for press releases.</seg>
<seg id="2">For my part, I saw in Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude, as well as in Michel Foucault's, a need to target a culprit, a scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="3">They both develop very rational lines of argument, but this rationality is based on these scapegoats, which are the keystone of their thoughts.</seg>
<seg id="4">I believe rather that for Foucault the State was essential as the culprit.</seg>
<seg id="5">This stems from a very archaic way of thinking, sacrificial thinking, which is also magic thinking.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem with the relationship with the other is solved by eliminating it.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is an anarchizing, neo-lib and/or libertarian inclination (of the two terms the second marks a reinforcement of the desire to eliminate the State, the first knowing how to find help from the State for its deals) meaning less State / no State at all in Foucault.</seg>
<seg id="8">The old dream of the base which organizes itself beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="9">His thinking is built on the culpability of the State: without this culpability it does not hold up.</seg>
<seg id="10">Where there is a culprit, there is also elimination, murder, sacrifice.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is not taking a stand against the three intellectuals quoted here.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nor support for that matter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, those of God back then, Stalin, the little father of the people.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ooh la la, you undoubtedly read a little too fast if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apologia for Khomeini.</seg>
<seg id="15">Today, even Pierre Manent would not enjoy attacking Michel any more in this way.</seg>
<seg id="16">Gauchet presents a deep reflection about the contemporary individual and the group, on the difficulty posed by the mechanism for support in our liberal advanced societies.</seg>
<seg id="17">Whether one agrees with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.</seg>
<seg id="18">Seeing this plot orchestrated by researchers of human sciences from the hard left who cannot bear that we do very well without allegiance to their mantras is quite laughable.</seg>
<seg id="19">The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people has no limits.</seg>
<seg id="20">An important point to add seems to me to be the position of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.</seg>

<seg id="10">Also I believe that attitudes in Russia have changed since the 1990s and especially in the last few years: they are becoming more prosperous, the prosperity is spreading outside major cities, and with that prosperity people are travelling overseas and seeing how others live.</seg>
<seg id="11">From what others have told me, most Russian prejudice has been against temporary unskilled workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, working in occupations and living in areas where they are likely to be exploited by their employers or exposed to high levels of crime and violence.</seg>
<seg id="12">Though I lived on banks of Yenisey river, in Sibiria.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sadly, I've heard Australian opinions on both the Chinese and Aborigonals.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is very strange that a foreigner tells me that I can't stand Chinese, when I met two in my life (once was abroad), don't have any bad memoirs, people as people, and, actually, the London ones were very friendly that's why I remembered at all that they were Chinese.</seg>
<seg id="15">Otherwise you don't remember who you meet, people like people are, how to remember who was who.</seg>

<seg id="1">No measure for impartiality of justice.</seg>
<seg id="2">Yet, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups which are very much left-leaning, such as the magistrates' union...</seg>
<seg id="3">@Marabout: sorry, but the judiciary sectors are frankly right-leaning.</seg>
<seg id="4">As for the magistrates' union, it only represents 25% of judges.</seg>
<seg id="5">If a measure of its partiality can be taken from the relativity of the enforcement of laws in the courts, it demands two obstacles to be moved away</seg>
<seg id="6">That of the observer's political vision and the magistrate's factual interpretation.</seg>
<seg id="7">It remains then the required tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on the fundamentals.</seg>

<seg id="15">A sensitive subject in proportion to the power to cause harm* granted to the judicial institution capable of such heresy.</seg>

<seg id="17">This professions obtains, in a good or bad year, 150 million euros while benefiting from the cover* ensured by the virtual judicial impunity* of the French notaries.</seg>
<seg id="18">To understand their mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.</seg>
<seg id="19">Where that joins the aforementioned statistical* improvement moderated by the preceding comment is that the judicial institution produced, during the many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to have themselves spoliated in this way, a whole range of jurisprudence contrary to all the laws in favor of heirs.</seg>

<seg id="14">Many have a reasonable insurance pay-out to utilize.</seg>

<seg id="16">The fact is that the wheelchair market is a niche market, so they can afford to charge high prices for things they know we need.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Whill could hardly be described as minimalist.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">Where do you get that from?</seg>
<seg id="2">Because the Germans refused to pick up any survivors.</seg>
<seg id="3">I'm not sure if Spee 'refused' to pick up survivors as such.</seg>
<seg id="4">One aspect of the battle was that neither side appeared to sure of the exact strength their enemy.</seg>
<seg id="5">Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee left the area promptly because he had received a report of a British battleship in the area.</seg>
<seg id="6">The seas were stormy earlier in the day - not sure whether this was still the case when the battle concluded?</seg>
<seg id="7">Equally, combat ended after dark so this would make any rescue operation more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="8">Contrast this with the subsequent Battle of the Falklands, where photos of survivors being picked up show millpond-like seas and broad daylight.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, the rescuers knew there were no more German combatants in the area by that stage.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hmm, not how I remembered what I had read of the battle so I did a quick wiki:</seg>
<seg id="11">There was some confusion amongst the German ships as to the fate of the two armoured cruisers, which had disappeared into the dark once they ceased firing, and a hunt began.</seg>
<seg id="12">Leipzig saw something burning, but on approaching found only wreckage.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nürnberg—slower than the other German ships—arrived late at the battle and sighted Monmouth, listing and badly damaged but still moving.</seg>
<seg id="14">After pointedly directing his searchlights at the ship's ensign, an invitation to surrender—which was declined—he opened fire, finally sinking the ship.</seg>
<seg id="15">Without firm information, von Spee decided that Good Hope had escaped and called off the search at 22:15.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mindful of the reports that a British battleship was around somewhere, he turned north.</seg>
<seg id="17">So if that is accurate the Germans, fumbling around in the dark before radar, did not know that one ship had sunk, so could not have searched for survivors from her.</seg>
<seg id="18">They also believed that there was a bigger RN battleship in the area which could have caused them serious damage, so in the confusion they quit while they were ahead.</seg>
<seg id="19">They were a long way from home and Spee was acutely aware that they had a lot of RN ships to get passed on the way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Cradock's sacrifice had already done them great damage by soaking up about half their ammunition, dooming them when they were eventually caught.</seg>

<seg id="3">If the FOM chose not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests, on no account the driver's.</seg>

<seg id="13">It is not the FOM that takes out the safety car it is the FIA.</seg>
<seg id="14">Significant difference.</seg>
<seg id="15">In view of amateur images, the lack of images enables the FIA above all to avoid annoying questions such as: How is it possible that the steward is waving a green flag mid-operation and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)</seg>
<seg id="16">No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the stewards is clearly seen waving a green flag, a sign that the race can continue normally and that it is no longer under the control of the yellow flag.</seg>
<seg id="17">Certain comments show a dark ignorance of F1.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the control of the yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, hence the green flag is flown.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is the usual procedure.</seg>
<seg id="20">The stewards' post just after the accident (depending on the case, this can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) is waving the green to tell the drivers to resume a normal speed.</seg>

<seg id="3">Moreover, all the Israeli excavations underneath and around the esplanade of mosques for several decades have not been able to find anything.</seg>
<seg id="4">The temple mount, if it exists, it is elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Perhaps in Argentina?</seg>
<seg id="6">This mount is not looked for due to the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of mosques was built.</seg>
<seg id="7">Its summit, or the dome of the Rock, juts out in the middle of the Omar mosque.</seg>
<seg id="8">For Muslims, Mohammed went up to heaven from this rock.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Jews, it is the mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.</seg>
<seg id="10">From the moment when it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.</seg>
<seg id="11">Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remember that regularly, and they unfortunately took over in the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the 2-state plan, and scrapped it continually!).</seg>
<seg id="12">It is also to show to what extent the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful event.</seg>

<seg id="17">It is a bit scary all the same.</seg>

<seg id="19">Shame that the Reuters photographer did not take a photo of the hundreds of Palestinians authorized to go back to the temple Mount and who prefer to stone faithful Jews down below, praying at the wailing Wall.</seg>

<seg id="3">I thought it could do with a conversation starter.</seg>
<seg id="4">Anyway, it was Joffrey's wedding I watched - there was some top, top, top, baking action on that episode</seg>
<seg id="5">Joffrey's wedding episode features one of the finest show-stoppers (albeit misdirection - it was the wine) in TV history.</seg>
<seg id="6">Also, mmm pie.</seg>
<seg id="7">Game of Thrones!</seg>
<seg id="8">I love GBBO!</seg>
<seg id="9">Second final in a row where strangely it almost seems like the least worst baker on the day wins - no - one seemed to go "bang - here's my big bastard of a cake now bang it in your mouth and bow to the best" !</seg>
<seg id="10">Perhaps the added pressure of friends and family outside finally gets to them?</seg>
<seg id="11">In previous weeks all those outsiders have been kept away.</seg>
<seg id="12">Plus there's the feeling of 'stay safe, there's always next week' which disappears on the final week.</seg>
<seg id="13">I love baking but can't imagine putting myself through this.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remain grateful to this who do and who give us some lovely entertainment and inspire us to try something different next time.</seg>
<seg id="15">Roll on GBBO15!</seg>
<seg id="16">Id agree, last years final challenge, the wedding cake, was ludicrous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Professionals usually take days to make them and they were expected to knock one together in 3-4 hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">The three showstoppers were all so neck and neck I couldn't imagine how they'd pick a winner.</seg>
<seg id="19">Luis' bottom layer being a bit dry was the only real fault they found (though I agreed with Hollywood that the lime green icing on Richard's windmill was a bit off putting, though Richard had already blown it by that point).</seg>

<seg id="3">A bad moment for humanity to go through is expected.</seg>
<seg id="4">You are mixing solar wind and ultraviolet rays up.</seg>
<seg id="5">UV rays are mainly blocked by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV rays.</seg>
<seg id="6">So, even if the magnetic field gets weaker, there would not be enough solar wind to "get rid of" the stratospheric ozone.</seg>
<seg id="7">There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancers".</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately the ozone layer does not block UV rays.</seg>
<seg id="9">They have loads of useful functions that you cannot even imagine.</seg>
<seg id="10">If we limit ourselves to man, they are concerned with allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), heating us (apart from infrared), modulating our immune system and, it seems, improving our morale.</seg>
<seg id="11">The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVC and lets UVA and the majority of UVB through.</seg>
<seg id="12">Do you know that you are not obliged to be condescending and to consider your interlocutor as a backward person when you post a comment?</seg>
<seg id="13">Above all for a minor clarification which was implied in the comment, which itself intends to show pedagogy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Without saying that I know melanomas well, UV rays only ACCELERATE their development.</seg>
<seg id="15">They do not CAUSE them.</seg>
<seg id="16">As proof: all tanned people do not necessarily have melanomas.</seg>
<seg id="17">That is to say, when a doctor tells you that it is necessary to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen as UV rays are necessary for every human.</seg>

<seg id="6">OK then no hard feelings, I send you a kiss</seg>
<seg id="7">We call bohos, or rather eco-bohos, people who see the world through an ideological "software program", which leads them to disconnect themselves from realities.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is the full unbundling of thought-reason.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are experts in gesticulation, for example they claim to save the planet because they avoided having a shower.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are also experts in hypocrisy, agreeing with the caviar left, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.</seg>
<seg id="11">The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not put up with this mixture of oafish ideology and hypocrisy, therefore do not be surprised if you often find criticisms on them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wow, thank for this complete and exhaustive theorization and for all the associated details (plane, shower...).</seg>
