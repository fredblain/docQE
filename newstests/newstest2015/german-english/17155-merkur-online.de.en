Children need roots and wings
He was a school teacher for 44 years, 23 of which he was the principal.
During his teaching time, Manfred Richter got to know many schoolchildren who are now fully-grown adults living in Petershausen and Kollbach.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but they were always based on his desire to see the adult in the child.
Mount Sněžka is one of the best-known peaks in the Czech Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves this painting of a picture from his childhood home.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today's Trutnov.
He was interested in becoming a teacher as early as the age of 14, after he had been a secondary school pupil for four years.
One year later the Germans living in the Sudetenland were dispossessed.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months spent in a holding camp, they moved to Bavaria in 1946 - in a goods train.
That was how he came to live in Senkendorf, in Upper Franconia.
The teacher training course was in Bamberg.
In order to get to the school, Manfred Richter had to go six times per week on foot to the nearest train station; take the train to Bamberg; from there walk three kilometres right across the town to the school; and then make the return journey home.
After two months. Manfred Richter was given a bed to sleep at the Red Cross Home in Bamberg, in a sleeping quarter that he shared with 15 fellow students.
In 1951, he took his first state exam, and his second in 1954, after spending three further years as a teaching candidate.
Since Upper Franconia had no free teaching place for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and received a post on 1 November 1954 at a school in Kollbach.
The "Young Women's Room" was his first "Service Flat" in the school building.
In 1958, he moved into the new-build teacher accommodation next door to the school, into a three-room service flat.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was closed in 1968.
Until then, the school district association of Petershausen-Kollbach had three classes in Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
In the school year of 1968/69, these classes were accommodated in Petershausen, in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf Schools Association was founded, the only school left in the locality was the primary school.
In order to avoid a deranking of position in the now smaller school, the then dean, Georg Sigl decided to move to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen continued to grow, and so the children and their teachers, from September 1982 onwards, could move into the present-day building, which has since been extended, after Richter took his retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated manner and spirit of generosity of the then Mayor, Ludwig Götz, who was able to secure municipal funds to build an additional work-room and extra rooms in the cellar as part of the 1997 extensions - although the council guidelines governing school-building work did not allow subsidies to be used to pay for this work.
"Mayor Götz was a great friend of the school," recalls Richter, with gratitude.
Throughout his whole career, Manfred Richter never forgot a reply given in a speech by a government representative, in answer to a presentation given by the schools council on law and justice: "One should never forget to love". Manfred Richter duly implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"One has to give children two things: Roots and wings," says the 84 year-old.
But experience has also taught him that: "One doesn't always achieve that." Whether by that he means his pupils or his own six children, is unclear.
In any case, Richter's methods were at times unconventional.
If school children got into fights, they were not given punishments like, for example, writing out lines or serving a detention.
At the cost of the council, Richter bought two pairs of boxing gloves, and then let the two antagonists fight it out, even if this did occasionally produce a black-eye.
For the benefit of the school, Richter nurtured a good relationship with the then Mayor, Ludwig Götz (CSU).
Following his retirement, Richter, who had no political allegiances, was encouraged by the Mayor to run for election onto the local council as a candidate for the CSU in 1996.
However, Richter finished in sixth and joined the CSU.
