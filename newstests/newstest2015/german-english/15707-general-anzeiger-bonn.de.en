Glandorf retires from German National Handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the German National team.
The 31 year-old from German Bundesliga side SG Flensburg-Handewitt said that it was mainly for health reasons that he had reached this decision.
"It was not an easy decision to make, but I've been thinking about it for months.
The time has come to listen to the signals my body sends and to end my national team career," announced the 2007 World Cup winner on his Facebook-Page.
He retires from international competition with a record of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
The powerful-throwing right-back wants to continue for the next few years to shoot goals for the Champions-League winners from Flensburg, and will therefore not be available for selection by new German National team head coach, Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf said he had had a "nice long talk" with the Icelander, who will select his squad on Tuesday for the games against Switzerland.
His ideas and approach to the game have always inspired me, as I am sure they will also inspire my long-term teammates and my successors, too.
"I would like to represent my club in the next few years and I need longer breaks and more recovery time to do so, and the double burden of also playing for the national team wouldn`t allow me to do that."
The left-hander feared his career might end in 2012 when he had a heel infection.
Due to achilles tendon problems he was given a cortisone injection by doctors working with the German Handball Association, and this caused severe swelling of his foot.
He needed an emergency operation and two further surgeries as well.
Glandorf then brought a legal action against the team doctor; however, this ended in a settlement.
Twelve years as a professional and eleven years with the national team would take their toll on any player.
"I have some health issues I can't ignore anymore.
After three foot-surgeries within a short period of time in 2012, caused by infections, I have never been able to control my blood pressure.
I've also got some other minor issues related - wear and tear.
At the beginning of the year I realized that I was able to control my head, but I couldn`t play tricks with my body," he explained in an interview with German magazine Handball Time.
He would only consider a comeback if really necessary.
"If we are in real big trouble, then I might consider it," the two-time father told the magazine.
"But I can count the years I will continue to play handball with one hand.
And I have to admit that I have become really humble after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, when it comes to my health.
After my career I would like to walk straight, to be honest."
Besides the 2007 World Championship he also won the Champions League in May and the EHF-Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
He also won the Cup Winners Cup with Flensburg in 2012.
