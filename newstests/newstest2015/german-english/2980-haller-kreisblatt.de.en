Dance-crazy youths wanted
Just try it: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and manager Lisa Neitzel (from left to right) are looking forward to new members.
Like many other clubs, the jazz group also runs a day-long class in TV Jahn in order to make it to the prep school.
Some groups have seen sharp declines in attendees after the summer holidays.
Now, they are eagerly on the look out for youths for a sport which is healthy and a lot of fun.
There are now only nine children in both the jazz and modern dance group given by Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits".
The 20-year old tells us there are "three in the eight to twelves, six in the twelves to 15".
If there were more active participants, the whole thing would be a lot more fun, "we could dance to completely different choreographs", she said.
Anyone interested in dancing can come along and have a go, there is no obligation to join. The session run on Thursdays between 5 and 6, and on Fridays from 5 until 6:30 PM in the dance room at what was Hotel Meyer, 9 Freistra√üe.
"Training usually starts with a warm up program", the trainer explained.
We then practice different choreographs.
JazzDance is such that there is no hard and fast way of doing it, which makes it open to many styles.
Elements ranging from folklore and classical to sports and acrobatics are worked into Jazz Dance.
And of course, the socializing isn't bad either.
"We sometimes go out to eat, watch dance films, and we have also slept over in the dance hall before now", Lisa Neitzel tells us.
You can make friends in the group, share a wonderful hobby, and also do a great deal for your own motor development.
If Jazz is not your thing, then you can also come along and try out one of the other groups offered by TV Jahn.
Children and youngsters are always welcome to pop in and have a go during Wednesday's class. They can choose from children's dancing/jazz, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance teacher is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to attend the dance evenings on Mondays and Wednesdays.
If you are interested in discofox, slow waltzes, Viennese waltzes, rumba, cha-cha-cha or the tango, drop in and take part.
