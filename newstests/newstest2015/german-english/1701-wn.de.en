The scandal surrounding arts advisor, Helge Achenbach, will be heard for the first time in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, the son of the founder of Aldi, Theo Albrecht, are suing Achenbach and two of his companies, who are in the process of declaring themselves bankrupt, for 19.4 million euros compensation in a civil case brought before the DÃ¼sseldorf district court.
The news was announced by a court spokeswoman on Monday.
According to the statement of claim, when purchasing the works of art and antique cars, Achenbach conned them, and invoiced Berthold Albrecht for more than the actual sales price.
In so doing, the agreed commission also turned out to be more.
Achenbach purchased valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
