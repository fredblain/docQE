After its second win of the season, Hütteldorf is in third place on the table.
A bitter week came to an end for Rapid on Sunday with a 2:0 win over Grödig.
Coach Zoran Barisic, whose team reached an interim low at the end of the Europa League on Thursday, said that "the victory is very liberating".
The captain and goalkeeper, Steffen Hofmann, who climbed up to third place with Grün-Weiß, confirmed that "the sense of achievement was extremely important".
Schrammel's dream goal has led Rapid on to a road to victory. Two winning seasons show that Rapid have reacted in the right way to the disappointment experienced against Helsinki, and they reach the end of the international season with heightened morale.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction", the defender Thomas Schrammel said, whose magnificent and skillful corner in the 14th minute set them on a winning course.
"I thought I'd build up all of the frustration from Thursday, and smashed it into the top of the net", the 26-year old said smiling.
13th of November 2010 was, until now, the last time that Schrammel had scored in a team from the Bundesliga, and that was with Ried.
His first championships goal at Rapid-Dress will, therefore, always be a special memory for him.
"That is something quite special for me, I am Rapid offspring", Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic's recent pelvis injury, Schrammel moved from playing left back to right back, where he also did a very good job.
He had enough experience to be able to play in the mirrored position.
He deserved the goal, Barisic stated. He has already achieved some assists this year.
The team shows character. Schrammel also crossed the ball over to Hofmann after the first hour, which led to the decisive 2:0 victory.
But before that, even the fans could have kept the score.
"Thank God we had some luck today", Schrammel noted, alluding to the gap between the efforts made and results achieved in the past weeks: "The results were not justified, but the games were always better when compared to last year".
Barisic even decided that the team had previously played "better in other games than today", and against "the strongest team to play in the stadium this season".
These are the first three points since 26th July, and therefore prove that the structure of the team is intact despite the setbacks: "Today, my team has shown that they have character".
For him, what is just as pleasing is: "The fact that we have finally played to a clean sheet again".
A lot of work was done during the internal football break. The unfortunate circumstances that led to the absence of Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger, as well as the fact that Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger joined the first team, is what makes this success all the more valuable.
"We must not forget that", Barisic said, who has lost players in the last three days, including Behrendt and Pavelic, "who recently were very stable".
The international football break therefore has to be used "to lick wounds and to improve physically a bit", Barisic explained, who has five under 21s in his ranks.
For one of whom, captain Hofmann, the break came in particularly useful.
He bends over backwards for the team, ignoring any pain.
Especially during these difficult times, he showed that he is a very important player for us", Barisic stated.
Before being substituted in the 68th minute, Hofmann not only gave structure to Rapid's game, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year old, who played his 350th game in the Bundesliga, it was his first goal since November 2, 2013 (4:2 against Admira).
Hofmann: "We must not think that all is now well". "I am sure we had a bit of luck on our side, but, at some point, that luck had to come back to us.
It was high time", Hofmann said.
Of course, he spoke about focused and continued work: "You don't have to always see things black and white.
We haven't been playing as badly in recent weeks as it has been made out to be.
However, we mustn't think that all is now well.
His importance to the team is something that he could not deny.
After all, it is a very young team, which, I am able to help at the moment.
They hold on to me in certain phases", Hofmann said.
Grödig's coach, Michael Baur and his team have little to blame themselves for.
He is sorry about the quick counter goal, describing it as "a kind of magic goal", as well as the normal goal scored by Nutz in the 40th minute, which was wrongfully denied by the referee, Kollegger.
The only criticism I can make about the team is that we were sometimes not precise enough upfield.
Because we had far to few goals.
Center back, Maximilian Karner thought the same: "It started off badly, but we then found our feet, and even scored a goal.
All in all, we could have had more.
