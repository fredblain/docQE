Mayor Wolfgang Wild and state secretary Albert Füracker have taken on the sponsorship.
The original name, "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" (gun society Tannenwald Berngau) dates back to 1907, when, on 21st March, the club was founded and described as "social entertainment by means of pistol and small-caliber target practice".
In 1937 the Nazi regime closed the club down.
Then on 30th April 1964, 19 young men founded the club again, and launched the "new" gun club "Tannenwald" in Berngau at Lukas guest-house.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as range officers during its tough early years. The main objective then was to find a club pub and set up a shooting company.
As early as autumn 1965 the shooting club started out in "Leininger" guest house with two teams competing against one another.
The following year, target shooting was set up as a sport, organized into seven teams, ranging in ability, all the way up to the local premier league.
The club records roll out every year, and the magic 380 rounds were set up for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the achievements of the active members has increased, so have the number of members.
Once the club pub "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern gun club, the club's management at the time, lead by Johann Rinn, decided to set up its future home in the basement room of the new "Landgasthof Härteis" (a country hotel).
After 2700 hours of hard work, Father Strasser issued the blessing of the church for the new guns room on 8th May 1988.
One of the greatest highlights in the history of the club was without doubt the 44th local shooting competition, which is linked to the formal consecration of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On 23rd and 24th April 1994, the shooting club celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 the cannon group was founded.
Josef Schmalzl was the head of the cannon division.
Organizing the Bavarian Cannon Meeting in 2005 was a huge challenge for the "cannon shooters", and for the club as a whole.
Many hours of voluntary work was dedicated by members of the club last year to modernize the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngau courtyard, making it state of the art.
Eleven teams go head to head
The sporting achievements of the shooting club are also impressive.
Currently there are a total of eleven teams that are taking part in the competitions: six air rifles teams, one pellet gun team, one KK1 sport target pistol team, one youth team and two old-timer teams.
The first team comprised of Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann was promoted to number 1 in the regional league in 2013/14, up from the local premier league (the highest of the shooting leagues in the ANB).
The second team comprised of Verena Moosburger, Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml was promoted from the North local league to the local premier league.
In addition to shooting, events such as Bockstechen, Fasching and Königsball, club excursions and also Christmas celebrations are all club traditions.
The shooters also attend the parish and community festivals.
