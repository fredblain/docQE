A few years ago, when the second table tennis regional division was canceled in an attempt to streamline the leagues, a step in the right directions was taken.
Now, the German table tennis association has introduced an additional, third league into the program.
The consequence: Any team that has not been promoted, has been demoted.
For example, Göttingen's top class team, Torpedo, avoided demotion in the premier league relegation, but will now play in the fifth division as of next season.
The Torpedo's women's team remain in the fourth division despite their superb clean-sweep in the Regionalliga.
The Torpedo boys and girls are starting in the Lower Saxony liga, just like the lads from SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and Torpedo reserves are stepping up into the new Verbandsliga, but there are no longer any clubs from Göttingern in the Landesliga.
For the women, TTV Geismar does play in the Verbandsliga, and the Torpedo's second team plays in the Landesliga.
From a structural point of view, this seems to be a better regional division, when in fact, it is just the new Southern Regional Premier League.
Stepping up into this are: TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
Dransfeld and SC Weende represent the area in the regional league, whereas TTC II, Rot-Weiß, Bovender SV II and TTV Geismar II and III represent the area in the regional division. The Regional Premier League for women is at least kicking off with a good start.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are all here as part of the party.
In the regional league, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen are taking to the field.
With each of the nine teams
SC Weende sends a girl into the small regional league.
Even the regional league's relay team for SCW boys, which is where Torpedo II is also starting, is not complete.
As for the regional division, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV are heading into their season.
In the first season of the newly-founded regional association, both district divisions from Göttingen are starting out with each of the nine teams.
As for the West relay team; that is made up of Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen are some of the teams making up the East relay team.
The women's district division is made up of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
That is much better than the district of Osterode, where there are no longer any female teams at a district level.
It is remarkable that none of the six second division teams in the district achieved their potential. The innovative and bustling district committee are going to have to come up with something.
