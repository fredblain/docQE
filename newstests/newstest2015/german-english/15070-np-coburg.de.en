In an announcement to the regional German newspaper 'die Neue Presse' Pötzl contradicted the comments of managing director, Peer Medau, and said that the latter was behaving like a "military general."
This was not the style of the college, he said.
He said that the Medau family "were informed about the plans of the college in the middle of June.
They are simply wrong to say that they only learned of the plans in July".
At the same time he also said that the plans were not about "final decisions already made," but rather about "stating preferences".
He also said that the building work to widen the narrow access road up to the castle would not be as radical as the Medaus feared.
It was not - and will not be - a matter of a nine metre-wide road.
We currently aim to widen it by 5.5 metres, which is one metre wider than before,"explained Pötzl.
Pötzl refutes the argument of the Medau concern, namely that its cost-free parking places which belong to the school, will in future only be available for use by the college students.
It won't be a case of everywhere being parked up, because we have time to find intelligent solutions, as has been the case with other car parks, too.
Think of the neighbours
The children's nursery Bergwichtel, which is situated on the space in question, and in front of the front door of which the access road to the parking level will run, is "not to be impacted" according to the college president.
He is far more concerned to point out "that it's not only an issue concerning the children's nursery, rather it is about the people who live by the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Strasse and the 800 schoolchildren of the adjacent secondary school.
It's therefore about a lot more than the individual interests of the Medau gentlemen," he said.
Whether the criticism by the parents' association for the children's nursery is correct that the extension of the road will lead to "one of the few remaining natural spaces in Coburg being lost," he said the "readers can decide for themselves."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg regional building authority, plans to present his plans of development of the college up to 2020 "and to talk about the importance of the extension work in this context."
Peer Medau informed the parents of the children's nursery about the plans, last week.
Accordingly, the access for the new parking level will not now lead, as before, via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Strasse, but rather via the Medau-Berg.
Thus, the narrow road must be widened into two lanes over a stretch of about one kilometre.
According to higher estimates of the Medaus, the traffic in the Hohenfels castle park would increase ten-fold.
They are talking of 2000 vehicles every day.
Meanwhile, the town council refused to comment.
