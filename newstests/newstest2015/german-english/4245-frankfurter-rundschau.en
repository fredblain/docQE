Twin town: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - a popular combination even in China.
German beer is enjoying an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's twin town in China would like a brewery, and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer brewed in Frankfurt's twin town of Guangzhou - that is the burning desire of the Chinese officials.
"We would be delighted if a German brewery would set up business in our city", the deputy party secretary of the southern Chinese city, Li Yiwei, said this week during a visit to the city by an SPD delegate.
Time and time again throughout the conversation, the official of the ruling communist party in China came back to this wish of the twelve million people metropolis.
Guangzhou, which is also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China Li advertised.
So, the people also have the buying power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German delegation, said to the host that he would keeps his ears open in Germany for a possible partner.
"You don't need a lot to make beer: good water, grain and a zest for life", he added over lunch with the senior party member in Guangzhou.
This zest for like already beams out of Mr Li, he said flattering the host.
After that, the official from Guangzhou clicked glasses with Schäfer-Gümbel - albeit with red wine, which was served with dinner.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao has traces leading back to the German art of brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business operations
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, the deputy party leader, Li, said.
Lufthansa used to offer such a flight, but canceled it for economic reasons in 2012.
"It would be worth it again", the local politician seemed convinced.
"The business operations between our two cities are continuing to grow".
At present, travelers would have to take a detour via Changsha in the province of Hunan, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital city is Guangzhou, is also hoping for a flight connection.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this wish during his talks with the social democrat.
"That is a very good idea", Schäfer-Gümbel answered - the Chinese deputy minister, Li Jinjun, an intimate expert on Germany, nodded in agreement.
Well-cultivated partnership
The affable deputy party leader of Guangzhou hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei has already been to the Main, but not in the capacity of his role.
He only took up office this year after his predecessor was removed from office over corruption allegations.
Even the party leader of the region, Wan Qinglian, had to leave.
The action taken against the officials from Guangzhou is part of the nationwide campaign against corruption in parties and the administration, which was rigorously implemented by the head of state, Xi Jinping.
Before his career in politics, the new senior politician, Li Yiwei, worked for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Chinese communist party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he was working as a senior official in Fujian, where car manufacturer VW has built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially adopted more than a dozen twin cities.
Guangzhou, one of the twin cities located some 9000 kilometers away, is a connection that will be well looked after and cherished by both sides; for example, with a school exchange.
Last year marked the 25 year of German-Chinese relations.
The South China metropolis, which lies on the Pearl River, is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen thanks to its economic power.
Next year they would like to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
