NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break their agreements with Russian as a result of their planned deployment to East Europe in response to the Ukrainian crisis.
In Brussels on Monday, the Secretary General of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said that NATO will adhere to the NATO-Russia Council formation agreement of 1997.
Nevertheless, the head of NATO accused Russia of "a flagrant breach" of the agreement.
"Today we must face up to the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner", Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side reveal "that they consider us as enemies".
Strengthened NATO presence

Due to the disputes over gas prices, Ukraine has not been receiving fuel from Russia for weeks.
The EU Energy Commissioner, GÃ¼nther Oettinger has recently arbitrated between the two sides.
Ukraine warned that Russia could also suspend the gas supply to Europe.
Europe purchases around one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large proportion of which flows through Ukraine.
