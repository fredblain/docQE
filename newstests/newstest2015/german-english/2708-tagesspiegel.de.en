Ebola: The epidemic is putting strain on West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a huge hit for the economy.
Markets have been abandoned, and international companies are keeping their distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic has dealt the economy in West Africa a heavy blow.
Crops are rotting in the fields, mines have been deserted, and the markets have been abandoned. The virus has cost the region dearly.
Even some international companies are keeping their distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one", the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka, concluded.
Liberia is the most affected country
"It is a total catastrophe; we are losing a lot of money", Alhaji Bamogo said, who sells clothes in the second largest market in Liberia's capital city, Monrovia.
The only people to come to the market are those who want to buy food or disinfectant against Ebola.
Liberia is the country most affected by the virus; here alone more than 600 people have fallen victim to the fever.
The health authorities recently explained that the disease has reached all corners of the country.
The virus has even spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people have already died, and thousands more have been infected.
Foreign businesses are pulling their employees out
All over countries rich with resources, companies are suspending operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to affected regions.
Even local traders and farmers are reacting: Only a few business people are still leaving their home towns to replenish their supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, where they have been put under quarantine, cacao and coffee beans, to name a few, and which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.
The farmers do not dare leave their homes for the crops.
Food suppliers are scarce
"People are traveling less and less", Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa said.
For example, a man, who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables, is choosing to stay at home.
The population is, therefore, facing the consequences of the epidemic head on and feeling the pressure: Food suppliers are scarce.
The supply of staple foods such as rice is dwindling in the markets.
At the same time, the image of the region, which is heavily reliant on international companies, is under threat, and this has far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies are avoiding the region for what is essentially a long time, Phillippe Hugon, from the French Think Tank, Iris, said.
What is crucial is how wide and how long the virus will continue to spread.
Investors may get the impression "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and, therefore, also to invest", Hugon warned.
The disease is also burdening the already strained national budgets of the States
The disease is also burdening the already strained national budgets of the affected States.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets are being heavily strained by the high expenditure on the health system, and also by the declining economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to provide financial aid to the tune of 60 million dollars (45 million euros) to the health systems of affected countries.
The effects in Nigeria, where up to now only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed, are already noticeable.
Yet the oil-rich region in the south of the Niger Delta is not yet affected.
However, elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of becoming infected.
There is even a marked decline in the number of hotel reservations.
