Something is happening on the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest (castle garden festival).
The organizers' idea was right.
Despite the heavy downpour of rain on Saturday evening, approximately 1200 music fans went to the open air festival in the castle garden.
Admission had to be stopped on occasion.
"It was annoying", according to Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel lights and fun.
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem coined the name "Armula" from two Spanish words.
Since the open air castle garden in Salzwedel was supposed to beam out bright lights during the wide range of daytime and evening shows.
Well, you make your own fun anyway.
This was already apparent early on Saturday when the first visitors set off for the open air.
The organizers promised a festival fit for all generations.
And that is what they delivered.
Around the supplies stand located in the meadows of the castle garden, people from Salzwedel, but also guests from near and far, made themselves at home.
They followed the first live performance, tapped their feet in time, and enjoyed refreshments. In short: Pure relaxation and enjoyment.
And that goes for all generations.
Whilst some people sprawled out on blankets placed on top of the white sand around the beach bar, which had been carted in especially, others indulged in a glass of wine in the wine store, and the kids went crazy on the bouncy castle, which was a huge attraction for the little guests.
However, even the children's face painting kept the volunteers' hands full, in the strictest meaning of the word, as the children rushed to become men, and conjure up fanciful creations on their small faces.
The more grown up ones played on the football table or took part in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot-Crew from Salzwedel had organized.
And then the rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 PM the rain pelted down onto the visitors; and families did a runner in search of somewhere dry.
Despite this, the festival's attractions did not get called off.
"More people than expected came", Rom Sem said, who called the event a "success all round".
As such, nothing is going to stop them from repeating the big party next year.
Even though more has to be done in terms of the size and content of the event, the first balance sheet done on Sunday made the voice of the people crystal clear for Sem.
He said that one annoying thing was that they had to stop allowing entry into the event temporarily.
Apparently not enough security guards had been booked with the security company.
The consequence: Some people who had already paid could no longer get into the grounds.
Feedback has been very good.
In a preliminary and cautious estimation, the Salzwedel co-organizer estimated that around 1200 visitors attended the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound engineering.
The hip hop band from Salzwedel, Blocks 'n' Rox, abandoned their performance somewhat unnerved by these problems.
The engineers could not get a half-decent sound out of it.
A shisha lounge had been planned but could not be built because the tents could not be delivered to Salzwedel due to a puncture.
The organizer insisted that "they will, however, be there next year".
The premier of the Amula-Open-Airs was more than a success in terms of the number of visitors.
And that was with bad weather.
Nevertheless, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will be excused as it was their first time, but which have to be avoided next time round.
The event organizers also had to accept criticism on the social networking site Facebook.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros, I really expected more", Melanie Meier commented on the event's page.
"Unfortunately, you bit off more than you could chew", according to Ele Zimmermann on the same page.
For others, the teething problems were not such a big issue.
I think it is really good that some people are not just standing around talking rubbish, but are actually making a real effort to get something up and running.
Hats off!", Stephanie Jen√ü wrote about Amula.
Now the organizers have a year's time to address these criticisms.
