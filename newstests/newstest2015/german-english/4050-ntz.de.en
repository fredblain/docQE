Retired Sergeant Major Berni Biether has been working as an artificer ever since the closure of the former military training ground
Not a shot has been fired in the former military training ground in Münsingen for almost ten years.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition turns up in the center of the biosphere region of Swabian Jura every month.
The shells are sometimes so dangerous still that they have to be detonated there.
A deafening bang echoes across the center of the biosphere region upon detonation.
The last live round to be fired at the military training ground in Münsingen was in December 2004, which, at the end of 2005, after 110 years of military operation, was closed down.
Since then, the 6500 hectares of land has been the center of the Swabian Jura's biosphere region, which opened up 13 designated pathways for hikers and cyclists.
