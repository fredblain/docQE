Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and increasing wages
Strict environmental standards for the future shall apply to all cars and vacuum cleaners that go on sale as of today.
As of September 1st, new vacuum cleaners will come with a label, similar to that on refrigerators and washing machines, which will allow buyers to see key information at a glance, such as the energy efficiency of the appliance.
New cars that fall under the emissions class "Euro 6" will receive a higher nitric oxide value.
Aside from this, there is more money for scaffolders: They will receive a minimum wage of 10.25 euros as standard across the whole of Germany.
