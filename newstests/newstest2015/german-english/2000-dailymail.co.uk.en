The Beslan survivors' decade of hell: Ten years since the horrific school siege, how the children caught up in it are still suffering
Ten years ago over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity
Exactly a decade after the appalling Beslan school siege in which 334 perished, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamic terrorists kidnapped and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the start of a new term, it seemed like the nadir of all evil.
The tragedy united east and west in revulsion, which amazingly then turned to action and hope for the future in the direst misery.
Ten years on, we went back to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity.
We discovered amazing young people, who have defied adversity, though the memory of this terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war now scarring Ukraine - in which children like them are dying - will now stop.
The girl pictured trying to climb back inside the blitzed school gym
She was famously snapped by top Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov wearing only her underwear as tried to climb back inside the blitzed school gym after a mine exploded.
Bewildered, Aida was desperately searching for her mother, Larissa, now 40.
Both were feared dead, but in fact they survived.
'A woman told me to run for my life but I couldn't,' said Aida at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mum.
A soldier plucked her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had totally recovered but said yesterday: 'Three months ago, the pain came back.
I fear I may need more surgery.
Some shrapnel pieces are still in my knee.
Her aim now is to become a dentist, to help people as she has been aided by medics.
'This tragedy changed my life but it surely did not break it,' she said defiantly.
'It happened to me and you can't change this fact.
Once a year I always go to the gym to recall those who remained there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too much.
My best friend and my classmate-to-be Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together.
'I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I will think about a family later.
She says the siege remains with her though memories fade a little each year.
I am pleased that many people in the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see online the photograph of me climbing into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, understand about our disaster, and stop this from happening any more.
The boy who fled through a hail of bullets believing his mother to be dead
He was on his first day at school (Russians start school aged 7) and survived the three day siege hugging his mum Tamara.
Then seven he said: 'Mummy told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.'
After one explosion he thought she was dying.
She told him: 'Run'.
Fearing she was dead, he fled and on his way he saw a crying toddler, grabbed the child by the hand, and fled through a hail of bullets.
His dad Vladimir, who scooped up his son outside, said: 'Damir told me his mother had died.
He said: 'I couldn't save her'.'
In fact, Tamara had stumbled free and was in hospital with leg wounds, in turn believing her son had perished.
After their reunion she said: 'I wept with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now defunct News of the World newspaper) to be crowned a Barnardo's Children's Champion by then premier Tony Blair and wife wife Cherie.
'This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop recalling it,' he said yesterday.
Still I can say that in my mind it is fading.
I remember right afterwards, I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting and it is not a problem for me.
'I'm not scared to go back in the gym but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard who never got out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, specially the toy shop where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted, and riding in an open top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of misery he and his friends suffered.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop recalling it
'I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,' said Damir, who was last week doing voluntary work at a nunnery.
I want to help so much.
I want to serve in the police one day and hope they enrol me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: '37 kids were killed in our neighbourhood, can you imagine?
I remember terrible silence right after the siege, there were just no children to shout and run around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly recalls her trip with Damir to London.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I realised then how folk on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, can show their support.
She was grateful to 'Cherie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just say it myself that 10 years have gone but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borsch soup, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he was playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir was shooting at them from his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.
And we were just one month away from our horror then.
I was amazed that the British people were so ready to share our pain and to support us.
She said: 'I keep thinking this world did not get better within these 10 years.
Now in Ukraine the war goes on, people are dying every day, and I believe many children were killed and will be killed.
They are just the same children, like ours.
I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what those people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and it is so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very gentle and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
He is not seeking revenge for example, he is not preoccupied with this past horror.
I know that he does not like to recall it but he is very close with six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was smaller he suffered from it - I remember he used to lie down on the sofa with his face turned away from us, for hours at a time.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his guns and other army-type toys.Damir is 17 now, taller than me, nice looking, clever and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for some hours I was so sure he was dead and I'd never see him again.
When I managed to recover after the explosion and got on my feet I looked around, I saw the hell around me, when body parts were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that there was no way my little boy could have survived in this hell.
'I remember I was shouting to him 'Damir, run, run away' but again I was so sure he had not heard me.
But he did hear, and he did run away.
So life goes on for us unlike for so many.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose shocking image after the siege came to define the horror of Beslan
Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mum Fatima after the siege in 2004, while on the right is Georgy today
His bloodstained face was etched with fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity at Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a senior GP, had dropped him for his first day at school before rushing to take her elder son Vladimir to university.
'I left two minutes before the terrorists rushed into the yard, so my little boy was left there alone for three days of horror,' she recalled.
Not completely alone, we had a family of relatives there but all of them were killed.
Only my Georgy managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is no single day when we do not recall this tragedy.
We do not feel it was long ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes from those days come to my mind all the time.
Nobody will ever forget, I promise you.
Haunting: The image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and has been immortalised in a statue (right)
I remember Georgy so much wanted to go to school on that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only got to know he was alive when I saw him TV.
And now there is even a statue to crying Georgy in San Marino.
Georgy does not like to look at this picture and it is hidden it in the bookcase in our home.
I understand, but I also think that thanks to this picture people from all over the world feel our pain.
Georgy says now: 'It's important this can never happen again.
'I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is moving to something very bad.
'I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no-one wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need dozens of years to pass in order to forget it a little.
It affected my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege but then it got better.
I got back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
This is why I keep going to the gym as each 1 September approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It is hard for me to go inside the gym but I must do it.
I do not feel myself a victim, this story is the part of my past now.
I will not forget it but I do not feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year entered a medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I will learn to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to go in the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health did not let me.
I wanted to fight for my country but it will not happen.
Georgy Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite having been trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miraculous: Georgy Farniyev was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege but still managed to survive
As the siege was underway, he was pictured trapped inside the gym, sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is truly a miracle he was not killed.
'We feel as if it was just yesterday,' said Georgy, who wanted to train as an intelligence officer in the FSB, but was unable to because of damage to his health in the siege.
It is still with me, this is not something I left behind.
I am older now and people use to say children easily cope with bad experience - I must say this is not true.
'In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I did feel a bit better afterwards but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when I went inside the gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never ever go there again and please don't ask me to show where I sat in that well-known picture.
Survivor: Georgy Farniev pictured today, with a photograph of him in hospital follwoing the siege on his laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I do not like to think or discuss it and they never asked me about the school.
In terms of physical condition I am well.
I should be careful with my knee which was injured but I walk fine now.
Still my health did not let me go and study in FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical papers, and they replied it was not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have completed two years there.
He is learning to treat all animals 'from cats to cows'.
He said: 'I know I would never tell my children about my experience.
This is not something children should know about, and of course not something they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: 'This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets close.
I will go and attend ceremonies being held to mark it.
I know Georgy won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there and I was not.
I was waiting for him at home, not able to help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me.Here in Beslan the imprint is on everyone.
It stays with us.
Georgy is an adult now but that horror is still with him.
It is hard to accept it when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He is a boy, he likes sports but he can't take part because of his knee.
He had several surgeries, he walks but cannot exercise.
I would say he 50% overcame this horror, but one can never completely overcome and forget it.
This horrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege, and it only adds to my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and they were dear for me.
My son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could do for me but my heart aches about those killed.
I know families where new children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want it.
I will never forget my heart jumping out of my chest at the moment I saw him in hospital.
Now I look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions.
What are those people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure many children were already killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If we could only grab all the rebels and throw them away - as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The baby who was carried poignantly to safety by a special forces commando
Saved: Alyona Tskaeva is carried to safety by a Russian special forces commando (left).
She is now ten (right) and has no memory at all of the atrocity
The world gasped in 2004 when baby Alyona was carried out of the Beslan siege cradled in the arms of a Russian policeman.
Terrorists let her go but cruelly kept her 30 year old mother, ten year old older sister Kristina, and brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and with his new wife Svetlana he has a baby girl, who he named Kristina after the daughter he lost.
Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the siege and has blossomed into a bright and happy girl, say neighbours.
'They are a big happy family now and Alyona and Makhar are both great kids,' said a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic dad and wants to get them away from all the memories as the tenth anniversary is marked.
You can understand why.
