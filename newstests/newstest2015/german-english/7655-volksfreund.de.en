Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
Around 1000 protesters have been forced out of the PTV buildings by soldiers, according to the Minister of Information, Pervaiz Rashid.
After a good half an hour or so, the station began broadcasting again.
The director of PTV, Athar Farooq, said that demonstrators armed with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial offices.
There was no mentioned of the number of people killed or injured.
The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the Head of Government, accusing him of vote rigging.
The police announced that on Monday, around one kilometer away from the residence of the Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, approximately 3000 demonstrators clashed with security forces.
According to statements released by the hospital, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured at the weekend when demonstrators attempted to gain access to Sharif's residence.
They are demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister.
Following a meeting in the army's headquarters on Sunday evening, the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict, stating there was "no time to waste or a need to use violence".
The statement also announced that: "The army remains bound by its duty to ensure the safety of the State".
The escalating violence stirred up concern that the military may have to intervene, a military that has already revolted on many occasions in the past.
The above protests, led by Imran Khan, an opposition politician, and Tahirul Qadri, a preacher, have been ongoing since independence day on 14 August.
Sharif is refusing to step down.
On Sunday Khan and Qadri called upon their supporters to persevere.
"We will not leave until we have forced Sharif to resign", Khan said.
Qadri made similar comments:
Khan accuses Sharif of having fraudulently won the parliamentary vote last May.
Qadri is demanding the resignation of both the central and provincial governments.
A provisional government should then reform the voting system, and call new elections.
More than 40,000 members of the security forces have been deployed to protect the government district.
At first, the demonstrators led a peaceful protest in front of the parliament building. Then, at the weekend, Khan and Qadri called upon them to force entry into Sharif's residence.
