New radar dome in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark dwindles
And not as one would expect.
In fact, the structural element, which is ready, is waiting to be installed onto the structure.
But this is just one of many things that need doing: Almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation radar TIRA, the case, known as the radar dome, is to be completely rebuilt.
With a diameter of 47.5 meters, the new radar dome will be somewhat smaller than the old one.
That said, the size will still be a world record.
The final phase in completing the new case is to change the cap
The top quarter of the old case will be separated and lifted by a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new case will be put in place.
As long as the weather is on their side, this should take place at the start of this week.
