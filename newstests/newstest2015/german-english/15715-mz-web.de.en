German economy as shrunk by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have put a curb on the German economy in the the second quarter.
The Gross Domestic Product sank from April to the end of June 2014 by 0.2 percent in comparison with the previous quarter.
This was announced by the German Office for National Statistics, which thereby confirmed previous estimates.
Consumption alone was a spur to the economy in the early part of the year, whilst investments were down.
Foreign goods trade had slowed, too.
Due to the strong start to the year, figures for first half-year GDP were up 0.8 percent from the second quarter of 2013.
