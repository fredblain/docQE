Merkel puts her foot down: "Let's be clear", tolls will come
Once again the Chancellor makes herself clear.
However, there is still no charter explaining all the complex details.
Stiff opposition from the CDU against the tolls is making the CSU increasingly angrier.
Following persistent opposition from the CDU, the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, has put her foot down with regard to the introduction of tolls.
"Let's be crystal clear: They are mentioned in the coalition agreement, and we will have them", the party leader said on Monday following a CDU party conference with top committees in Berlin.
But Merkel has not, for the time being, established a detailed model.
"Certain parameters" were mentioned in the black-red government program.
The Minister of Transport, Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) "made a suggestion, and we are continuing to work on it".
The NW-CDU, however, is insisting that tolls on all streets be objected against.
Merkel stressed that even the Minister of Finance, Wolfgang Sch채uble (CDU), is participating constructively in the consultations on the draft bill.
He has spoken with Dobrindt on the topic and about further possibilities for capitalizing more and investing more in infrastructure, such as developing broadband.
"There is nothing special about it". On Sunday, Sch채uble let an article in the Spiegel pass without comment, which stated that his house is testing its own concept for compensating motorway investors with returns on the tolls - after the 2017 election.
As a result, the leader of the CSU, Horst Seehofer, warned about developing toll concepts in the cabinet against the Minister in charge.
The deputy leader of the CDU, Armin Laschet, reinforced his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that all district and A-roads would get tolls", the state chairman for North Rhine-Westphalia said.
The fact that Seehofer has now announced that he will discuss this topic again is an important sign.
Opposition to the plans has also been received from the CDU state association in Baden-W체rttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is due to concerns that a toll would have a negative impact on small-scale border traffic to neighboring states.
Seehofer has demanded loyalty to the coalition following criticism of the tolls from members of the CDU.
Die Linke (the Lefties) are considering the plans a failure given the arguing within the union.
"The messed up toll is dead", Bernd Riexinger, the party leader, told the "Neuen Osnabr체cker Zeitung" (newspaper) on Monday.
"If the toll fails, the Minister fails". Dobrindt wants to introduce an obligation to have toll labels on all German streets as of 2016.
According to the coalition agreement, car owners in German must not, however, have to face additional charges.
As such, road tax should be offset against tolls for them.
According to EU law, however, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers due to their nationality.
