Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees at Neul√§nder Platz will now be accommodated in tents.
The reception centre for refugees in Harburg is full-to-bursting.
The German Internal Affairs Authority has now given the go-ahead for the Red Cross to erect the three tents.
The local area politicians were only informed about it a short while before - and they are not happy.
"These one-off actions only stir up more doubts in the minds of the public, and they give the local politicians no chance to work out a constructive plan of how to house refugees in a humane manner," said, for example, Britta Herrmann, Chairwoman of the Green Party in the Harburg district assembly.
Her party is calling on the Harburg district authority to deploy empty houses to accommodate the refugees.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the over-crowding in the initial reception centres are mainly the sudden increase in numbers of those seeking help, as well as the fact that the authorities cannot make available enough places in suitable accommodation.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
