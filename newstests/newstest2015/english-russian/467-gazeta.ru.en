The kings can do it all
The now on-sale debut album by the group, Royal Blood – the new hope for British rock – has taken rock duos from nightclubs straight into stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo has only be on the stage for a year, but they have already managed to earn a nomination for a BBC music award, tour as the opening act for the Arctic Monkeys, and receive a visit from the one and only Jimmy Page in the dressing room at their New York concert.
Their self-titled debut album has already received 100 thousand pre-orders several months ahead of its release, and the contract for its distribution belongs to one of the major labels – Warner Music.
Given the sorry state of the current music industry, this situation is quite remarkable; after all, we’re not talking about the next Lana Del Rey or your run-of-the-mill, sweet-sounding representative of the “new R&B”, but about a moody-looking duo of Brits that plays with such a level of volume and intensity that hasn’t been in vogue for several decades.
Overall, given everything mentioned above, the expectations for the first album were particularly high – and they have been fully justified already.
The duo chose their name, which up until now one might only expect some desperate long-haired metalheads to take on, for good reason: it’s clear that they feel as if the blood of kings runs in their veins.
Here, we of course are talking primarily about the heroes from a previous level, Led Zeppelin: just like the great foursome, Royal Blood have made it their goal to shake up the stagnant blood of British rock, taking it to new heights.
While it’s probably still too early to forecast the success of this enterprise, it’s not too early to make some predictions.
The ten songs laid out over thirty-something minutes aren’t so much a demonstration of phenomenal compositional talent, as they are a confident and strong declaration of such intent.
It’s impossible to deny the merits of certain tracks: for example, the lead single, “Out Of The Black”, stands out in that one remembers it not for its melodic line, but for its drumming.
The musicians jokingly say that this song is easier to tap out a beat to than to sing.
It’s also worth singling out the equally powerful “Little Monster” and the record’s closing composition, “Better Strangers”, with a Shakespearean reference in its title.
While there is truth to the notion that each of these songs would sound great at a party for hard rock fans, when playing them back to back they begin to merge into a more or less uniform canvas.
This is not necessarily a bad thing, but rather quite the opposite.
Royal Blood’s strength is that they aren’t trying to become the next Lennon or McCartney (they’d be more likely labelled as Motörhead’s successors), but they have brought many rock duos out of the indie club ghettos.
Their music, in spite of some variety, is made for stadiums, whereas, in places that are meant for less than a couple thousand of people, it feels noticeably cramped.
The secret, in part, is in the clever use of bass, which supplants the traditional place of the guitar – a technique that was pioneered by The White Stripes at the start of the 2000s.
Admittedly, it’s not only about the instruments, but also in the very approach to the composition of the songs.
Members of the retro rock movement in the 2000s, with great difficulty, pushed themselves beyond the postmodernist paradigm, and, with great reluctance, moved to call themselves not just imitators, but independent creative entities.
Royal Blood already sounds so brazen and powerful that such drive helps to successfully cover-up some of the repetitiveness and bullheadedness of the musical material.
After all, who said that rock had to be intelligent?
