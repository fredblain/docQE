The calculation of budgets for construction projects in Russia will be done in a different way
The Federal Antimonopoly Service is taking special control of issues related to price determination and regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems connecting to networks.
An expert council on the development of competition in the sphere of construction has been created within the AMS.
At a meeting, the Head of the Department for the Control of Housing and Public Utilities, Construction, and Natural Resources of the AMS, Vadim Solovev, stated that “the current method for calculating budgets for construction projects is absolutely incomprehensible”.
The regulatory framework makes the determination of prices non-transparent and could lead to unsubstantiated construction costs, the AMS reckons.
They are suggesting that construction costs for government-owned facilities should be determined at the design stage on the basis of market prices for design concepts instead of the currently employed estimate standards and unit costs for operations.
These proposals have been formulated as a “road map”, which is currently under consideration by the Ministry of Construction.
“The replacement of traditional cost estimating documents in construction with calculations of structural components should lead to less corruption in the industry, Vadim Solovev explained to RGB.
After all, right now every bolt and nut is calculated into the estimate, and it’s not always possible to check it all, and, as such, every now and then, unethical construction companies can bury “a whole tractor” in the documents.
The Ministry of Construction is in agreement with the AMS.
“The first achievements in the transition to cost calculations of structural components are now ready: methodologies for calculating costs for design concepts and the budgeting process using these indicators have been developed”, the Head of the Department for City Construction Activities and architect with the Ministry of Construction, Elena Zhukova, told RGB.
The road construction industry has been chosen to pilot the project.
However, experts consider that the problem is much more serious.
As the Head of Profi-Invest construction company, Anatoly Demyanko, told RGB, the estimate norms have been out of date for quite some time, but no other mechanism has been offered to businesses thus far.
“As for the proposed cost calculation of structural components, it will be difficult to implement in practise, since the construction of buildings often requires the use of totally different technologies”, he declares.
It’s no secret that the construction industry is developing in large part thanks to state contracts.
According to Ekaterina Lezina, Chair of the Board for the NPO, Expert Community of State Contract Professionals, right now, the state is the most solvent client.
Vladimir Malakhov, Deputy Director of Engineering at the Industry Expertise Centre for Capital Projects at Rosatom, drew attention to the fact that today’s market is basically divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and those companies that possess a monopolistic area of expertise and refuse to let any competitors into that field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible under the condition that access to contracts will be fully protected from somebody else’s control.
At the Expert Council, it was proposed that the system of government orders be set up so that the same contractor would not be allowed to receive more than one contract valued at more than 1 bln. roubles or several contracts valued at more than 1 bln. roubles.
The Ministry of Construction is under the impression that this approach needs to be evaluated from the perspective of its impact on business and the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in a case like this, it would be necessary to entrust the client with the functions of the prime contractor, which would lead to an increased number of staff for the client, as well as an increase in budgetary expenditures to maintain them.
Moreover, the client’s specialists would have to possess the knowledge required to assess the quality of work completed by contracted organizations, as well as its safety.
Oftentimes, with this type of set-up, it would be necessary to determine who will bear responsibility for the safety of the project as a whole.
Furthermore, this approach might lead to an outflow of highly qualified personnel from state procurement contracts as a result of a lack of interest in receiving a state order for only part of a project and a low value contract.
Deputy Head of the expert-consulting centre, Public Procurement Institute, Aleksandr Yevstashenkov, believes that, right now, the procedure for state contracts has turned into a professional test of a contractor’s attention to detail.
He offered the following example: “upon filling-out an application for tender, a participant must provide ‘concrete indicators’ without using the words: ‘or equivalent’, ‘should be’, ‘up to’, ‘more than’, ‘less than’, ‘analogue’, ‘or’, ‘a type’, ‘a similar type’, ‘not lower than’, ‘lower than’, ‘higher than’, ‘may’, ‘may have’, ‘may be’, ‘earlier’, ‘not earlier’, ‘not higher than’, ‘not permitted’, and so forth.
In this way, clients often abuse their right to establish the content requirements for the application given to contracting organizations.
Another problem with Federal Law 44, according to Yevstashenkov, was the requirement to once again assess the quality of work at the application submission stage through a “paper” proposal by the participant.
But in considering a participant’s application, it is really only possible to assess the contractor’s qualifications, and not the quality of work, which hasn’t even commenced yet, the expert reckons.
The quality of work can only be assessed once it has been completed.
At the Expert Council, it was also suggested that marginal revenue be transferred from the upper to the lower echelon in order to remove interim contractors.
The Chair of the Expert Council, Official Secretary, and Deputy Director of AMS, Andrei Tsarikovsky, believes that this shouldn’t be done, because the general contractor should be in-charge of the project.
Otherwise, it will turn out like the line from the famous satirical skit by Arkady Raikin, “At the Tailor’s”: “Do you have a complaint about the buttons?”.
