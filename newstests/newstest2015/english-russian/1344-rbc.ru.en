The largest Chinese companies have joined forces against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including the largest developer of commercial real estate in China, Dalian Wanda Group, and the Internet giants, Tencent Holdings (social media, messenger, and others) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online retail market with Alibaba.
However, it won’t be easy to catch up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has already surpassed even its American competitors – eBay and Amazon.com.
Union of the largest
The companies plan to invest 5 bln. yuan ($814 mln.) into their joint venture, of which 70% will belong to Wanda and 15% will belong to each of the Internet companies, a statement by Wanda Group says.
It is planned to register the firm in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine the search services of Baidu with Tencent’s popular social platform, WeChat (the largest social media site in China, with close to 438 mln. users), and Wanda’s infrastructure.
In addition to its chain of 40 fashionable hotels, the Wanda Group controls a minimum of 49 commercial real estate facilities throughout China and 40 shopping centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 bln. yuan (more than $8 bln.) into the construction of a film studio and a theme park in Qingdao (a city in the east of China on the coast of the Yellow Sea).
It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 mln. visitors every year and turn a profit of approximately $960 mln.
In addition to this, Wanda owns the American AMC Entertainment Holdings movie theatre chain, making the company the largest movie theatre operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to outfit all of its shopping centres, hotels, and recreational facilities with e-commerce services, the development of which Alibaba, now established as a competitor, will also be engaged in.
According to Dun Tse, who heads the new company, as a result of the merger, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users for its e-commerce services from the current 40 mln. individuals to already 100 mln. by next year.
The new framework should become the largest online-to-offline platform in the world, notes Dun Tse.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract online buyers to go to regular off-line stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O includes coupon retail services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O – is the largest ‘pie’ in online commerce”, stated Chair of Wanda, Wang Jianlin (quoted in Bloomberg).
“Currently, no real O2O platform exists in China, and, in a situation like this, everyone’s chances are pretty much equal”, he believes.
The Chinese Internet sales market is the largest in the world, and, according to an analysis by McKinsey & Co., its value will grow threefold by 2015 in comparison to 2011, up to $395 bln.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 mln., information that Bloomberg cites from the official statistics, which is larger than the population of any country in the world, except India.
Furthermore, according to forecasts, by 2015 this number already may rise to 850 mln. people.
Union of the richest
Until recently, the Head of Tencent, Ma Huateng, was the wealthiest person in China, however, according to Bloomberg’s index of millionaires, the founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, has already surpassed him by $5.5 bln.
Jack Ma’s wealth is valued at $21.8 bln., $11 bln. of which can be attributed to his share of Alibaba.
The Head of Baidu, Robin Lee, currently holds third place among the wealthiest people in China, with Wang Jianlin in the fourth spot on the ranking.
“It’s really interesting to follow this battle: three of the wealthiest people joining efforts to through down the gauntlet to an even wealthier person,” the Director of the Chinese E-Commerce Research Centre in Hangzhou, Cao Lei, told Bloomberg.
But he doubts that the new company will be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately following its creation: “Rome wasn’t built in a day”.
The fact that Alibaba is not so easy to compete with, not only for new companies, but also for established leaders in global e-commerce, is confirmed by the report published yesterday on Alibaba’s finances for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something in between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both American companies combined.
Alibaba’s net profits for the period are almost twice as high as the similarly summarized figures of their competitors – it rose almost threefold on an annualized basis and amounted to $1.99 bln.
“Alibaba still holds huge potential to generate money, thanks, in great part, to its mobile apps,” an analyst from Hong Kong’s Arete Research Service commented in the Bloomberg report.
According to Alibaba’s updated prospectus on the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s website, there were 188 mln. active users of the company’s mobile services in July, which substantially exceeds its figures for March (163 mln. people).
Moreover, 32.8% of all of Alibaba’s transactions over the past quarter were made through mobile apps.
Alibaba will have to set the price of its shares ahead of its IPO.
According to the average estimate of 11 analysts polled by Bloomberg, the company may be valued at $187 bln. after the sale of its shares.
According to the information of Bloomberg’s sources, Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may happen already on September 16.
The company’s roadshow ahead of this event will commence on September 3.
It is anticipated that Alibaba’s IPO will set an all-time record on the NYSE and will enable the company to attract around $20 bln.
Until now, the record for the largest volume of investment attracted to a US stock exchange belonged to Visa payment system, which first offered its stocks in 2008, making $17.9 bln. on the deal.
