Will there be cheese after the embargo: Medvedev advised agrarians
Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, believes that, under the conditions of the embargo, Russian agrarians should adopt new technologies in order to produce the range of cheeses demanded by consumers.
The advice was given during a visit to the Yugptitseprom factory owned by the Agrokompleks company.
The head of government also advised restaurateurs to switch to Russian meat, which meets all necessary quality standards.
The year-long embargo on the import of foodstuffs was introduced in Russia on August 7.
