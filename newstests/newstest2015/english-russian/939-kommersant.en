Israeli authorities are determined to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
Israeli authorities announced that they are determined to annex 400 hectares of land on the West Bank of the Jordan River, which belongs to the Palestinian Authority.
As the BBC reports, the decision to annex the land of South Bethlehem is connected with the desire to seek revenge for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June of this year.
The Israeli Ministry of Defence announced the annexation of the territory on Sunday and ordered the military to establish administrative control over the West Bank.
According to a representative for the Gaza Strip, Saeb Erekat, the world community must call Israel to account for “the on-going settlement activity on the West Bank of the Jordan and in Eastern Jerusalem”.
