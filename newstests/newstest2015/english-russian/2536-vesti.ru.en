Twitter has tried to become more interesting to new users
The microblogging service, Twitter, has changed the process for registering users in order to more quickly engage new participants in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should lower the number of people abandoning their microblogs.
Now, new Twitter users will see a large number of accounts recommended by the service during registration, in order to immediately create their reading circle.
The recommendations are created on the basis of interests selected during registration.
Additionally, Twitter automatically ticks the add subscription boxes for all automatically selected accounts.
As a result, the user will have to manually unclick the boxes in order to not read what is uninteresting to him or her.
If before, users of the microblogging service only saw a user pic of recommended users, now Twitter will include an example of one of the blogger’s most popular tweets to help create an impression of that person.
This is the biggest change to Twitter’s registration page in the past three years.
Lately, Twitter has been actively working to modernize its service.
This activism is primarily related to the on-going efforts to try and reach a break-even point.
In 2014, the microblogging service was hit by slowed growth in the size of its user base and a drop in reader activity.
Currently, the company desperately needs a large number of more loyal consumers, who, having logged in one time, decide to stick around for the long haul.
This is the only way to ensure a steady stream of advertising.
