Heletey drags Ukraine into a continuation of bloodshed
With an appeal to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims, Ukraine’s Minister of Defence, Valery Heletey, drags the people into a continuation of bloodshed, reads a statement from the Russian MFA.
“In Moscow, of course, we took note of the statements made by the head of the Ukrainian military agency, Valery Heletey, who spoke about the ‘completion of operations to liberate the East of Ukraine from the terrorists’ and about the beginning of a ‘Great Patriotic War’, the losses of which would be counted in the ‘tens of thousands’.
The degree of appropriateness of the head of the Ukrainian military agency, who published the aforementioned post on his Facebook page, is a subject for analysis by specialists outside of the military sphere”, reads the statement by Russian diplomats.
They find it hard to believe that the minister of defence of a civilized state could make such statements.
On Monday, Ukraine’s Minister of Defence wrote the following on his Facebook page: “According to unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times to use tactical nuclear weapons against us if we continue to resist”.
Moreover, he stated that “the operation to liberate the east of Ukraine” was complete.
