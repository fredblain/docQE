Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists from the University of California, Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the experts’ discovery will make it possible to search for stars that are related to one another, that is to say, those stars that emerged from the same cluster.
The authors published the results of their study in the journal, Nature, but one can briefly get acquainted with them on the university’s website.
The reason for the homogeneous chemical composition of adjacent stars turns out to be turbulent mixing in the gas clouds where stars are created.
Even if the newly formed star later leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition will make it possible to determine its place of birth and the region where related stars were formed.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside of a cluster could result in differences in its chemical composition compared to related stars in a cluster.
The results of the simulations conducted by the astrophysicists prove that such differences should not occur.
The experts used a supercomputer in their research to simulate two streams of interstellar gas, which combined to form a cloud.
Over the course of several million years and under the force of its own gravitational pull, the object turned into a cluster, in which protostars began to form.
The scientists added indicating dye to the original gas streams and determined that the high level of chemical homogeneity was a result of the fast turbulent mixing in the cloud.
The astrophysicists believe that their study proves that it’s possible to look for related stars on the basis of chemical composition, as well as to determine the possible regions where these objects were formed.
