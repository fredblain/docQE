Sobchak and Vitorgan have a breakfast of cigarettes with Zhvanetsky in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maksim Vitorgan are currently in Odessa, a fact the television host didn’t forget to mention on her Instagram account.
However, one photograph shocked and utterly bewildered the couples’ fans.
The shot was taken at Zhvanetsky’s place.
“During breakfast at Mikhail Mikhailych Zhvanetsky’s place, Maksim explains what exactly Instagram is :)) #odessa”, Ksenia Sobchak wrote underneath the photograph.
However, aside from cigarettes, there was nothing on the table.
No coffee, no rolls, no butter, nothing of the sort…
The couple’s fans decided that Ksenia must also be a smoker, and they judged her for it.
“But whose cigarettes are those?”, “Smoking kills!”, “Some kind of a cigarette breakfast )”, “Supposedly it’s a breakfast, but there are only cigarettes on the table )))”, “Ksenia, do you smoke too?” – her blog subscribers were all-worked up about their favourite person.
To recall, Sobchak recently boasted about how delicious the very first dinner that Maksim Vitorgan ever prepared in his life for her was.
“Happiness is arriving at the dacha and your husband has already prepared dinner so that it is ready for you when you arrive (it’s the first time he’s done this in our married life together, but what a delicious dinner it was. The most important thing is that he doesn’t turn to me at the end of dinner and say the line from that joke: ‘now make sure it’s like this every day’”, Ksenia Sobchak boasted about her husband.
In the picture you can see that Maksim is whole-heartedly cooking something, while pickled vegetables and a roasted chicken are already set out on the table.
