There’ll be no shopping spree for Obama, Merkel, and Hollande in Vladivostok
The Duty Free shop at Vladivostok’s airport put up a sign prohibiting several world leaders from making purchases in the store.
They won’t be able to stock up on perfume, vodka, and cognac.
The store’s management decided that US President, Barack Obama, German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, French President, François Hollande, Vitali Klichko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Japan’s Prime Minister, and several other famous comrades will not be allowed to stock up on vodka, cognac, and perfume in their store.
And so, they posted an applicable sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama received an entry ban from a place he’d be even less likely to visit given his position: Moscow State University’s Dietetic Dining Halls, as reported on the institution’s food services website.
It is unclear whether or not the American President ever entertained the idea of eating at a dietetic dining hall in Russia, but the authors of the bans clearly consider themselves to be terribly witty.
