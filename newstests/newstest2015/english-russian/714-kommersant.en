The food sanctions aren’t frightening owners of Caucasian and Central Asian establishments, but for European and Japanese restaurants, Russian suppliers are a nightmare.
In general, the food service industry still prefers to substitute banned imports not with goods from Russia, but rather from Latin America, Israel, and China.
“It’s better to eat lightly-pickled cucumbers, than bad mozzarella”, laments Mariano Valerio, Executive Chef at Barlotti Italian restaurant, in regards to the quality of cheeses his suppliers are offering him in lieu of Italian ones.
The mozzarella and burrata cheese ran-out at the restaurant first – they have a short shelf life.
The stockpiles of parmesan should last for another couple of months.
What to do?
Switch to Russian products?
In 2005, I went to Dorogomilosky market.
Mariano Valerio makes such a face, that it is clear: the shocking memories have never left him.
Meat was sitting out on carts just 30 centimetres from the floor!
There were cats there!
Rats!
That’s when I said that we would never buy anything for our restaurant from Russian markets.
I don’t know, maybe things have totally changed there.
But this week, I was sent some fish on appro from the Far East.
And it turned out to be rotten!
I said that I didn’t even want to speak with the person who sent it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many things that are common in Italy are a rarity for the Russian producer.
Several years ago, I was in a position where I needed to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in a cold room for 10 days at a temperature of 1 to 2 °C.
It needs to hang there to become tender, so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with the local meat.
Then, they would ask me: where did you get such tender meat?
I would say: it’s actually your Russian meat!
Why doesn’t anyone do this here?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti, in the kitchen of the French restaurant, Brasserie Most, hangs a stop list that shows which items are out-of-stock: French oysters, sea urchin.
Executive Chef at Brasserie Most restaurant and Strelka bar, Triguel Regis, isn’t as pessimistic as Valerio: they’ve already replaced oysters from France with oysters from Turkey, and in place of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss ones.
However, Regis gets more emotional when the conversation turns to Russian suppliers: “200 roubles for cauliflower!
I ask: "Why? On what grounds should it cost that much?"
They answer me: "We need to make a living too".
But that cauliflower shouldn’t cost more than 80 roubles!
We buy oysters from the Far East by weight, and they live for 15-20 years, but can you imagine how much their shells weigh?
At that price, they really are a super delicacy.
It appears that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of horror for foreign chefs.
A typical story: “Everything was fine for the first three months and then the quality dramatically declined”.
The main complaints: Russian suppliers can’t sustain consistent quantities and quality.
Many European restaurants don’t know what they will do when their cheese stockpiles run-out

A sanctions menu
On August 6, Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which principally refer to food sanctions.
The import of beef, pork, poultry meat and by-products, deli meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheeses, vegetables, fruit, nuts, kielbasa, and sugar syrups into the country is forbidden.
A game of leapfrog has begun between restaurants and suppliers: prices for food products have risen, and they must urgently look for comparable products from other countries.
This has most significantly affected expensive restaurants that exclusively serve French, Italian, and Spanish cuisine, and import their goods directly from their “home” countries.
The food service industry has had to make alternative arrangements in the past.
For example, at the beginning of 2014, Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and, the year before that, American and Canadian meat.
Instead, suppliers established supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay, and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer of 2014 have turned out to be a lot more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which removes baby Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, planting potatoes, sweet corn, peas, and onions for planting from the ban.
Valerio the Italian hopes that the sanctions will be relaxed even further.
In the meantime, part of the restaurant industry waits in a state of uncertainty.
According to data from the company, Vostok-Zapad, one of the largest suppliers of the HORECA sector, the share of imported products in the premium segment of the market amounted to as much as 70%.
“Expensive restaurants will have to change their menus to fit with what local farmers and other countries are producing, says Sergei Mironov, restaurateur and owner of Reskonsalt agency.
If the head chef is talented, then it shouldn’t be a problem for them.
But, we only have very few chefs like this, and the preparation of a new menu could take two or three months.
Triguel from the restaurant, Brasserie Most, is ready for this: he will have to abandon 10-15% of his dishes, and still rework half of the menu.
Restaurants that offer fusion cuisine are already starting to substitute their dishes, for example, beef stroganoff in place of a marbled beefsteak, says Sergei Mironov.
“Cheeses from Europe can be substituted with Russian and Belarusian cheeses, and cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, and Chile, lists Oksana Glibchuk, a representative from the company Vostok-Zapad.
Cream and dairy products from Europe have equivalents in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the USA can be substituted with chicken from Russia and Belarus, and salmon and summer salmon from Norway – with salmon, summer salmon, and trout from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of European-produced vegetables and fruits can be offset by domestically produced goods, and by offers from Serbia, Moldova, and China.
According to Mironov, it will be easier for lower-end restaurant chains to adjust than for the premium sector: it’s doubtful that they are frequented by food connoisseurs who are capable of telling the difference between an Italian mozzarella and a Russian one.
Although, it will be difficult for Ginza Project establishments, he considers.
The Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
Changing this will take an enormous amount of time”, Mironov says.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the owners’ absence from the country.
Owners of cafés that offer Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that food products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European ones
But there are many restaurants that are barely affected by the sanctions.
This includes establishments with cuisine from CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian, and Azerbaijani.
“There aren’t any expensive ingredients in Georgian cooking, says Khatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant, Saperavi, and the café, Vai Me!.
All of our cheeses are produced in Russia, chicken fillet is the base for many of our dishes, and we don’t use exotic greens”.
As of yet, none of Kolbaya’s establishments have removed a single dish from their menus.
The sanctions are also no bother to Timur Lansky, the owner of Chaikhona N1, which serves Uzbek cuisine: he will only have to switch to lamb from New Zealand.
If Russia can establish imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, we'll be even better off, as it will be even cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
It’s possible to get cheaper fillet steak, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, and fruit from the CIS.
Moreover, goods imported from Central Asia are much better than the "plastic" from Italy, Spain, and Turkey.
Everyone knows that Uzbek tomatoes are delicious and sweet.
Nobody says that about Spanish ones.
Following the introduction of sanctions, a representative from Uzbekistan’s Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources, Olimboy Artykov, announced plans to double exports of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports to Russia almost immediately after the introduction of sanctions.
The fast food restaurants that responded to Kommersant-Dengi’s survey were also fairly calm about the situation.
McDonald’s press service announced that their localization exceeds 85% and that the chain works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, Head of the Supply Management Department for Subway Russia, the chain buys around 80% of its food supplies in Russia, although temporary difficulties, associated with the supply of vegetables and increasing prices for meat products that are produced using imported materials, may arise.
At Teremok, “sanctioned goods” generally accounted for no more than 4%.
The sanctions also haven’t affected Wokker noodle house.
KFC, Burger King, and Kroshka Kartoshka didn’t respond to Kommersant-Dengi’s survey, however, other market participants confirm that Burger King’s level of localization is significantly lower than McDonald’s.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are more likely to buy Chilean fish than those from Russia’s Far East
B(u)y one’s own pink salmon
In the meantime, restaurateurs are complaining that, as a result of increasing demand, prices are rising even on local goods.
“The prices of goods for Grabli have gone up by an average of 10-15%, and for the Italian restaurant, Cherry Mio, they have doubled”, says restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the prime cost of dishes will increase by 5-10%, Kolbaya acknowledges.
Vostok-Zapad doesn’t disagree: “For example, Belarusian dairy products have increased in price by 10-15% since the beginning of August”.
“Brazilian suppliers increased prices on pork by almost twofold, complains Sergei Rak, Assistant General Manager of Stardogs.
Chicken legs have gone up in price by 35%.
We are waiting for the prices from China; perhaps they will cool down the Brazilian hotheads.
In the near future, Stardogs will go ahead with a planned 8% increase in its prices.
Right now is not a very desirable time to raise prices, Rak says.
According to the statistics, revenue growth in the food service industry was only 1.8% for the second quarter of 2014.
This is the lowest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how quickly: the majority of restaurateurs have already stocked-up on goods for the next two months, in hopes of riding out the fluctuations in purchasing prices.
But nobody knows what things will be like two months from now.
On the square in front of Moscow city hall, there are dozens of tents decorated by greenery and trees.
In the centre, there is a stage where musicians are playing a waltz.
It’s a festival of regional food with the fun name “It’s time to eat”.
“Actually, we’ve been planning on having a celebration of local food for quite some time, and now, with the sanctions, we rushed to put the festival together”, says one of the organizers.
On the side of the stage with the musicians, the Greek chef, Anastas, prepares a salad from macaroni and homemade sweets; during the week there was a workshop on how to prepare borsch with caramelized apples.
Everything is made from Russian goods, the organizers attest.
In the tents, there is an exhibition on the achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, reindeer from Salekhard, vegetables from the Lenin State Farm outside of Moscow, cheeses by the Russified Italian, Jay Klouz.
“Salmon for restaurants can easily be substituted with a different fish from the salmon family from the Far East, says the owner of the fish stall, Our People, Filipp Galkin.
We catch all sorts of salmon: Sockeye, Chum, Coho, Pink, and Chinook – the "king of salmon".
Sure, they’re not as fatty as Norwegian salmon, because they are wild fish.
Norwegian salmon are actually an aquaculture product.
You can grab it with your hands and it won’t even wriggle.
But you wouldn’t be able to hold our salmon from the Far East in your hands.
Only an establishment without any particular pretensions would be willing to substitute Italian mozzarella with a domestic one
In the display case in his tent, there are shrimp with a tag reading “Magadan”, cod, omul, muksun, and mussels from Crimea, and scallops from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it’s high time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, the annual fish catch in Russia for 2013 was more than 4 mln. tonnes, with a significant portion of the fish caught being sent to Japan, Korea, and even the USA.
Fish imports for 2013 totalled around 800 thou. tonnes.
The Our People stall has been operating since 2012, selling fish through its on-line store, and was already supplying a dozen and a half restaurants, including Simple Things, before the introduction of sanctions.
Now, Galkin has received requests from another 15 restaurants.
You can make the very same sushi from our fish, he says excitedly.
We racked our brains and tried out various recipes.
Now we sell a million roubles worth of sushi per month through our on-line store.
Our fish is several times less expensive and the delivery charge is no more than 15 roubles per kilogram.
To vouch for his wares, Galkin prepares a Philadelphia roll with chum salmon for me to sample at his stall.
In contrast to rolls made with Atlantic salmon, these ones take longer to chew, but the knowledge that this is our fish, our own domestic fish, gives one the strength to do it.
On Our People’s on-line store there are even rolls made with halibut and ocean perch.
Sushi bars, however, prefer to substitute Norwegian salmon with the Chilean variety.
Galkin chalks this up to chefs who are too lazy to come up with new recipes using fish from the Far East.
“So far, our suppliers haven’t offered us Russian fish”, Dmitry Evseev, the owner of Killfish Bar, offers his explanation.
It’s a similar situation with other food products: Russian producers could very well fill these now vacant niches, but it isn’t happening.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project, Boris Akimov, right now, one can talk more about the substitution of imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There, they have large transnational corporations with strong logistics networks and large volumes.
Unlike our farmers, they are capable of quickly providing substitutes for banned imports.
That is to say, large producers from other countries will be the biggest winners of the import ban”, says Akimov.
However, last month the restaurant industry received a warning signal even bigger than the food sanctions.
Following the results of widespread random inspections by Rospotrebnadzor, three McDonald’s establishments in Moscow and two of its regional establishments in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily closed.
“We are studying the content of the submitted complaints with the aim of determining the actions necessary to open our restaurants to visitors as quickly as possible”, McDonald’s press service told Kommersant-Dengi.
The truth is that no one understands what will happen next.
If all of this is limited to just food sanctions, then this is an option we can live through, an employee from a company involved in restaurant consulting said, on the condition of anonymity.
But if they start to close down all the McDonald’s throughout the country, then this will be an entirely different case.
