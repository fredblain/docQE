No less than half of food products in retail chains should be produced in Russia, reckon State Duma deputies.
They have drafted a bill on this issue.
The issue at hand concerns the introduction of amendments to Article 8 of the Federal Law “On the principles of state regulation of commercial activity in the Russian Federation” and to the Tax Code.
The goal of the document is to introduce protectionist measures for Russian producers of foodstuffs.
An important specification, according to the bill, is that no less than 50 percent of every type of good in stores must be domestically produced.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, for example, fruits and vegetables in the winter, and, as such, a “rebate” will be applied to them to avoid causing possible discomfort to consumers.
The bill will simultaneously introduce changes to Russia’s Tax Code, by lowering the VAT rate to 10% upon the sale of all food products that have Russia as their country of origin, reports Izvestia newspaper.
On August 27, a bill, concerning the introduction of amendments to the Federal Law “On retail markets”, was introduced in the lower chamber of parliament, which proposes to reintroduce farmer’s markets in Russia, where small-scale producers would be able to sell their products.
