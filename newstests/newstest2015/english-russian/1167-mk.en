The doors to the new rural medical and obstetrical centre in Kuzhenersky district will open in September
Construction of the medical facility in the rural community of Toktaibelyak commenced in April of this year and was carried out according to the standard plan.
The cost of the project amounted to slightly more than 10 million roubles.
As reported by the Communications Department of the Head of Mari El, financing for the construction of the project was administered using funds from the Republicâ€™s budget, in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the finished prevention and treatment facility amounts to almost 230 square meters.
Medical assistance will be provided to the residents of eight residential communities here: the rural community of Toktaibelyak and the villages of Dementevo, Pyuncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraibelyak, Shinur and Chashkayal.
The new rural medical and obstetrical centre will replace the existing centre; the old building was erected in 1918, and has already long since exhausted its value, in fact, the interior does not meet sanitary requirements.
The new facility will open in the near future.
