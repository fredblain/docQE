A resident of Leningrad Oblast is convicted of passing counterfeit money in Karelia
The Republic’s Ministry of Internal Affairs reports that the man conducted his criminal business in the Olonetsky and Segezhsky districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
Notably, the accused already had managed to leave tracks in Vologda Oblast, where, in the spring of this year, he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later on, the man appeared before the Olonetsky district court.
At the end of the investigation into crimes committed in our republic, he was sent via prisoner transport to Segezha.
During the process of the inquiry, guilt was established in several instances of passing counterfeit money during the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of this year, a criminal case file with an indictment was sent to court.
On Friday, August 29, the court announced a ruling to change the term of incarceration to four years served in a standard regime penal colony.
The sentence hasn’t taken legal effect.
To recall, last week two other individuals who were passing counterfeit money, which was used by them to pay for things in stores in Petrozavodsk, were convicted.
The citizens of Azerbaijan also arrived in Karelia from Saint Petersburg.
One of them received a prison sentence of five years, and the other, four years.
Each of them was ordered to pay a fine of 500 thousand roubles.
The sentence has likewise not yet entered into legal force.
