How to effectively use lilacs in garden design?
Irina Okuneva answers our questions:
Since lilacs loose their nice appearance once they have dropped their flowers, it is a good idea to plant them together with other bushes.
They fit very nicely with many plants.
Moreover, one can and should plant lilacs beside both plants that bloom at different times and those that bloom at the same time as it.
Another bonus of lilacs is that they offer so many opportunities to get creative.
You can shape them into a standard tree of various heights, an attractive bush, a bush with a wide base, or even into something resembling a garden bonsai tree with a whimsical bent stock.
Just pick out the shape that works best with the design of your garden.
