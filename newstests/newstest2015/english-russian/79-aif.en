Entry toll zones may be introduced in Moscow
The Moscow City Government is considering the option of introducing entry toll zones as a method for combatting congestion on roads in the centre, in a similar way to other major world cities, reports M24.ru, with reference to the Deputy Mayor of Moscow for transportation issues, Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that has proven itself to be effective is an entry toll.
This is the expert opinion, which we will certainly examine and we will look at all the positives and the negatives.
It is too early to say whether any decisions have been made in this regard”, Liksutov said.
The Deputy Mayor emphasized that the experiences of Asian cities, which in terms of structure and congestion are very similar to Moscow, were of particular importance to authorities of the capital city.
One of the solutions taken from these countries is the construction of a central ring road, which is already being implemented, Liksutov added.
The recently launched construction of the Central Ring Road is one example of how it is not necessary for all traffic to pass through Moscow.
If sufficient bypass infrastructure were in place, then there wouldn’t be a need for transit traffic in Moscow”, the Deputy Mayor pointed out.
Maksim Liksutov also stated that the introduction of pay parking significantly decreased congestion on the streets of the capital.
According to him, authorities in the capital do not plan to stop with what has already been accomplished.
To recap, on August 26, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, took part in the groundbreaking ceremony for the start-up facilities of the Moscow Central Ring Road (TsKAD) project.
