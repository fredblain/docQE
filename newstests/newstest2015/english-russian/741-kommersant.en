Germany will send 30 antitank weapons systems to Iraq
Germany will supply the weapons to Iraq as a countermeasure against militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31, with reference to a decision taken following a meeting of members of the German government headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
According to reports, Germany will send 30 Milan portable antitank guided missile launchers, as well as 500 shells for them, and 8 thousand G3 and G36 assault rifles to Iraq.
The delivery will be made before the end of September.
Furthermore, a decision was made to allocate an additional 50 mln. euros in humanitarian assistance for Iraq.
On September 1, Ms. Merkel will address the Bundestag with a speech on this matter.
Until now, Germany has never delivered its weapons to “hot spots”.
The opinion of people living in Germany on sending the Iraqis weapons is split.
One half considers this to be the only way to stop Islamic State militants, while the other half expresses concern that these weapons may eventually end up in the hands of the terrorists.
