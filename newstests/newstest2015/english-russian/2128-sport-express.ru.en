Head Trainer for Team Russia, Valentin Maslakov, is pleased with results at the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, third place is a good result considering the lack of targeted preparations for the competitions.
Our athletes performed right on target, Ves Sport reports Maslakov as saying.
Third place is confirmation of the considerably high level of our team.
It’s nice that the French and even the Americans only have a slight advantage over us.
It needs to be taken into account that we did not prepare for these competitions.
The season is over and we didn’t want to compel our top athletes to compete in the DecaNation meet.
Over the past few years, we have come in second at this tournament, but this year, we have a brand new team.
The French, on the other hand, came into it with a battle-worthy team, including 13 European champions.
They didn’t hide their intention to win this year, speaking about it publicly on several occasions.
But even a host team of such calibre couldn’t stand up to the Americans.
This is why I suggest that the Russians, given the competition, performed at a good level.
But results in certain categories were a level lower than those at the Diamond League.
The season is over.
Obviously, the result isn’t that important to the athletes anymore, especially in the team competitions.
The most important thing here is the ranking.
Looking at the results, one has to agree, things reached a point of absurdity, when in the 1,500m race, the men got so carried away with the tactical intricacies of running, that the final results fell below the average…for women’s races.
