More than 330 people, including 186 children, died as a result of the terrorist attack committed in 2004.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent several days in Beslan.
We spoke with hostages who survived – most of them are now university students, with the parents of the victims, with the caretaker of the City of Angels cemetery, Ramon Kaspolatov, and with the Head of the Mothers of Beslan Committee, Susanna Dudieva, who took part in the special operation with members of EMERCOM, says our correspondent for our “Society” section, Elizaveta Antonova, who is working on a special project.
Having already returned to Moscow, we met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who was the President’s advisor for the North Caucasus 10 years ago and led negotiations with the terrorists, as well as with an officer from the “V” department of the Russian FSB, Vyacheslav Bocharov".
What particularly shocked me during my time working on this issue was that it seemed as if those ten years hadn’t come to pass in Beslan.
This issue is extremely painful for anyone that has even the slightest connection to it, and people are very reluctant to speak about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very troubling.
But we cannot forget Beslan, and I hope that we’ve succeeded in our task", Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographics design studio of Rambler & Co holding, which has been working as a part of the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15-year anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s time in power.
