First day of spring marked with wet and blustery conditions impacting Adelaide Airport flights
SPRING has sprung a wintry surprise on southern South Australia, bringing heavy showers and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
A further 5mm of rain fell on the city in the evening up to 9pm, following the 6.6mm that fell overnight on Sunday.
The latest rain came courtesy of a couple of short, blustery showers, including a burst that started just before 8pm that dumped almost 4mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter delivered an early dose of spring last week, temperatures dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.
The squally conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7.30pm but was hit by windshear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pull out.
Wind gusts were reaching about 50km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
Flight data showed the plane had to pull out of second landing and the plane eventually touched down about 8.40pm.
That flight's delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
A top of 16C is forecast for Adelaide on Tuesday, with the chance of a shower or two.
