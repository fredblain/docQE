Vesti Economics— Will Kiev reimburse Rosneft for the $140 mln. in losses?
Head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, announced that the company assesses the damages from the shelling of the Lisichansky oil refinery plant in Ukraine at $140 mln.
He spoke about this in an interview with Spiegel.
“We assess the damages to be $140 mln. and we will be carrying out negotiations with the Ukrainian government regarding the payment of compensation”, Sechin announced.
According to him, a modernization of the Lisichansky oil refinery plant was planned for 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
“There were no battles in the area, there were no ‘entrenched rebels’, but Ukrainian artillery destroyed a part of the industrial facility.
Furthermore, the process oil that had been pumped into the pipeline was lost”, he stated.
To recap, on July 18, two oil storage tanks were burnt down and two storage buildings were destroyed in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansky oil refinery plant.
The Lisichansky oil refinery plant is the main petroleum refinery in Ukraine, the first phase of which was put into operation in October 1976.
General output for the Lisichansky oil refinery plant amounts to almost 7 mln. tonnes of oil stock per year.
The plant is capable of producing Euro-4 standard fuel as well as batches of Euro-5 diesel fuel.
In March 2012, the delivery of oil to the Lisichansky oil refinery plant was halted due to its unprofitability.
It was decided to begin renovations at the facility.
After a year, Rosneft received the Lisichansky oil refinery plant along with TNK-BP’s other Ukrainian assets.
