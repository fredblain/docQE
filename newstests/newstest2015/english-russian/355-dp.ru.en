The dollar exchange rate on the MICEX rose to more than 37 roubles on news of new sanctions being prepared by the West in relation to Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar rate for ‘tomorrow’ settlements rose by 26.9 kopeks to 37.02 roubles by 10:29 (MSK), while the euro exchange rate increased by 30 kopecks to 48.73 roubles, according to Moscow Exchange data.
The bi-currency basket rose by 28 kopeks to the level of the previous closing and stood at 42.28 roubles.
Before the events in Crimea, the dollar hit its peak on February 19, 2009, when it stood at 36.43 roubles, but on March 3, 2014, it was already at 37.005 roubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House announced that US President, Barack Obama, and German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, are discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the rouble against both the euro and the dollar is here for the long-term.
The long-term forecast suggested this mark, says Anna Bodrova, a Senior Analyst with Alpari.
One way or another, everything associated with Ukraine will affect the exchange rate.
As long as this continues, investors will respond to it.
Today there were rumours about a military incursion that were not substantiated by any side, but the market turned out to be highly emotional.
All the talk about it being resistant to such kinds of news was proven wrong yesterday.
According to experts, the week will close at around the levels of 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
Tax season has ended, the price of oil is weak, politics, sanctions, and difficulties with delivering gas through Ukraine – these are all a part of the same chain.
It is also expected that inflation will soar: by fall, current prices will rise by between 5-10%.
Moreover, the season for vegetables and fruits will soon end and a vacuum of sorts will appear while the network reorients to alternative suppliers.
“The dollar went up to the 37 rouble mark, went over it, and then returned to its previous position – there is no overwhelming hysteria here, comments Konstantin Bushuev, Head of the Market Analysis Department at Otkritie Broker.
Everyone will also be watching to see if the promised sanctions will be introduced on Saturday, as there will be a NATO meeting.
The rouble, according to him, weakened sharply after the end of the tax season, then came the news about Ukraine, and, to top it off, the Central Bank announced last week that it will move to a fully floating rate by the end of the year and will renounce any kind of currency intervention.
If you take a look at the daily fluctuations, they are in no way different from those previously seen over the course of this month; everyone was frightened by the 37 rouble mark, the analyst continued.
But, in terms of volume, nothing spectacular occurred.
I'll remind you of the anxious times in the currency market at the end of January, when there was an increased demand for foreign currency, as well as on the third of March, when the Central Bank sold off a record volume of foreign currency.
But UFC Investment Company sees a positive side to the weakening rouble.
First and foremost, this means growth for the revenue side of the budget from export operations, as well as an improvement to the competitive advantage of domestic producers as a result of the rising cost of imports, says Chief Analyst for UFC Investment Company, Aleksei Kozlov.
On the downside, this may mean increased prices for imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency are significantly decreasing the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy and provoking an increase in inflationary pressures, which, as a consequence, has become a reason for the increased cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, slows the country’s economic growth.
If we’re taking about the stock market, the depreciation of the rouble somewhat mitigates the decreasing price of stocks denominated in roubles.
By way of example, during Thursday’s trading session, the MICEX index fell by 1.67%, but the RTS lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of decline in the indices is explained by the weakening of the rouble by more than 1.5% over the course of the day.
The weakening of the rouble has an emotional element to it, which explains the widespread rush to buy foreign currency.
Experience shows that emotions will slowly fade away and the rouble’s listed price will either partly or fully recover its losses.
“We suspect that, before long, we will see a ratio between the dollar and the Russian currency closer to the level of 36 roubles to the dollar”, Aleksei Kozlov remarks.
