Two unions meet
High-level negotiations in Minsk have failed to solve the issues for which they were convened, but they have created a new format: dignitaries from the European Union met with dignitaries from the soon-to-be Eurasian Union
Albeit, given the alarming matters (the situation surrounding Ukraine won’t tolerate delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union first discussed a series of “hot topics”.
It isn’t clear if a structure like this is capable of working effectively; however, it is obvious who’s skimmed the cream off the top of this summit.
Any question about this was put to rest on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, and after them other Eurasians, saw a new President Lukashenko on the television news broadcast.
The Belarusian leader was a model of polished gallantry, giving off the manner of a person who has just hit the jackpot and is planning to spend their old age in the lap of luxury.
How Maidan helped Lukashenko
The simultaneous arrival in Minsk of three major European commissioners (EU ministers), who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to present the final briefing on their behalf, was not only a legitimization of the President with 20 years of service.
It was a declaration of the acknowledgment of Minsk as a full-fledged member of European politics and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior Analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Denis Melyantsov, is certain that, from now on, Brussels won’t be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as before.
“The fact that Catherine Ashton met face-to-face with Lukashenko gives one a basis to assume that relations with the EU will continue to thaw”, he told Ogonyok.
This iceberg has a hidden part: Belarusian authorities had been preparing for this breakthrough since the summer of 2013, long before the start of the November Maidan movement in Kiev.
“Results with the EU had already been achieved: successful negotiations on simplifying the visa regime and readmission, dialogues on modernization, lists Ogonyok’s source, and negotiations on international security had been conducted with the USA.
The States even loosened their sanctions a little.
As far as Ukrainian events are concerned, well they themselves, as well as the Belarusian leadership’s response to them, simply ratcheted up the process.
On the one hand, Minsk succeeded in keeping its relations with Ukraine rather warm, so as to not significantly hurt mutual trade, and President Poroshenko was able to come to Belarus for the negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure didn’t recognize Crimea’s unification with Russia and called for the pro-Russian rebels in Donbass to be punished to the fullest extent, hasn’t had a falling out with Moscow.
Minsk hasn’t withdrawn from the Customs Union or CSTO, and there is a Russian airbase stationed in Baranovichi.
Brussels and Washington noticed Minsk’s balanced position on the Ukrainian question and put stock in it, the Belarusian experts are convinced.
Just how successful Lukashenko’s move towards political diversification turns out to be, will be seen by how often, in the near future, Minsk has the occasion to host meetings in the EU-CU format.
The press service for the EU High Representative for External Affairs and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton, wasn’t able to provide an impromptu response to questions about what Brussels expects from mutual relations in this new format.
Ashton’s Press Secretary, Maya Kosyanchich, only told to Ogonyok that, within the context of solving matters of war and peace, this issue isn’t a priority.
Furthermore, a statement came out that suggests that the next meeting place for negotiations on the Ukrainian question, with the participation of dignitaries in the new format, could be Kazakhstan.
The fly in the ointment for Minsk turned out to be a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that European Union representatives, it turns out, personally asked him about this.
Nevertheless, in the final briefing, Aleksandr Lukashenko made it clear that all sides are not opposed to having Minsk remain as the main forum for meetings in the Russia-OSCE-Ukraine format, as well as for meetings between heads of state and EU high commissioners.
This means that “Europe’s last dictator” has attained the status of a being a hand-shakeable European leader, who is helping to solve a global issue.
Best friend to the European farmer
Later the EU delegation itself, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, came to the conclusion that the main rationale for the summit wasn’t in fact the tragic situation in Donbass, but rather the economy.
As a matter of fact, the schedule for upcoming negotiations prepared at the meeting, which will deal with the supply of gas and overcoming the misgivings of CU countries regarding Ukraine’s association agreement with the EU, appears to be a much grander achievement than the peaceful declarations lacking concrete dates and numbers.
Commissioner for Trade, Karel De Gucht, nevertheless, indicated that EU representatives “came to Minsk to find a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, and not the other way around”.
It appears, however, that, even in terms of economics, the crisis in Ukraine “works” for Belarus.
Its consequences – first and foremost the reciprocal sanctions between the West and Russia – have provided Minsk, which is still feeling the pressure of sanctions itself, with long-awaited room to manoeuvre.
According to Jaroslav Romanchuk, Head of the Mises Scientific Research Centre and former Belarusian presidential candidate, European investors are keenly interested in Belarus’ ability to supply Russia with agricultural products in circumvention of the sanctions.
Moreover, the supply network structures, which Vladimir Putin admonished Minsk for at the summit, are pushing forward.
“The initiators of these structures”, Romanchuk stressed to Ogonyok, “are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They spent a long time developing networks to supply goods, including in Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and now, these networks have been destroyed.
Russian business critically needs to re-establish them, even if it’s through Belarusian structures acting as intermediaries.
The second subject, the expert continues, is connected to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to setting up production in Belarus, using Ukrainian raw materials, which is intended for the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers do about 4 bln. dollars in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trading structures could now turn out to be in very high-demand”.
According to Romanchuk, the role of forum host to negotiations between the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko, as well as in terms of developing economic relations with Europe.
He reminds us that losses to the EU’s agricultural sector, as a result of Moscow’s sanctions, are valued at between 5-10 bln. euros, and that the European Commission has, as of late, only offered agrarians 125 mln. euros in compensation.
The Belarusian President could offer Brussels the opportunity to work together to minimize the impact on European farmers.
This could raise Lukashenko’s profile in the EU to an unprecedented level.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked Belarusian authorities for their initiative to hold a summit.
But the paradox is that official Minsk denies its active role in creating the CU+EU format, and the Belarusian leader, at a meeting with his Ukrainian colleague, underscored that Kiev alone was the author of the new format.
“It was your suggestion to get together, without all the distractions, to discuss and to make a decision, in a direct manner, following the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to deal with the situation that was developing at that moment in Ukraine”, he said to Petro Poroshenko in front of the cameras.
However, observers have interpreted this as an attempt to appease Moscow, which is rumoured to have initially been against Minsk’s mediation, which has significantly increased its political clout.
The Belarusian diplomatic agency assiduously stresses that Belarus does not have ulterior motives in organizing cooperation between the EU and the CU on its soil, given that the final goal of such a format is the creation, in the future, of a unified trading area from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“This is absolutely in keeping with policies in other fields, including in the field of security, that are advanced and promoted by the leadership of our strategic partner – the Russian Federation”, Ogonyok was told by the MFA of Belarus, an agency, which, as of late, has been choosing its words wisely.
