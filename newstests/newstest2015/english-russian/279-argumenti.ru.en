Perez Hilton deleted all intimate shots of celebrities and apologised
Today more than 60 Hollywood stars were struck with horror.
Hackers managed to break the weak passwords for iCloud (a data storage service) on smartphones, after which their intimate photos appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
Although, not for long.
To recap, the official spokesperson for the star of The Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence, already reported the theft of photographs from her mobile phone, and also confirmed that all of the shots that are “blowing up” the web are, in fact, genuine.
Perez Hilton, the founder of the eponymous tabloid site, offered an apology to the actress, Jennifer Lawrence, and to her fellow colleagues, for the publication of their explicit shots, The Independent writes.
No, nobody compelled me to do it.
Their agents did not approach me.
But now I will delete the explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice”, the blogger wrote on Twitter.
However, all the explicit photographs of the stars have already been spread all over the Internet.
