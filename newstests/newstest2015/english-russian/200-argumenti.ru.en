Residents of Mariupol have setup a human chain against the rebels
Everything was calm in Mariupol up until last week – no one was eager to set up a Mariupol People's Republic – people in the city on the Azov Sea were busy working and living.
Now residents wait in terror for the “rebels” to arrive.
According to political analysts, the separatists are descending on Mariupol in order to access the Azov Sea – the city of Novoazovsk, which was also not previously a part of the self-proclaimed republics, was recently captured.
Residents of Mariupol decided that although the Ukrainian army would defend them its strength was no match against the well-equipped representatives of the DPR and LPR, and so they decided to help out their soldiers.
They are digging trenches and building roadblocks and reinforcements.
On Saturday evening, several thousands of residents arrived at the eastern boundary of the city and stood there as a human chain while singing Ukraine’s national anthem.
They are preparing to do the same in the case of an attack.
Volunteers are collecting and delivering munitions and foodstuffs, collecting medicine, and distributing newspapers.
Gradually, throughout the city, stores are closing and banks and ATMs are shutting down.
