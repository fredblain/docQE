Lavrov: Russia will not “slam the door” in the face of new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not “slam the door” in the face of new sanctions.
This was stated by the head of Russia’s MFA, Sergei Lavrov, while speaking in front of students and faculty members at MGIMO University.
I won't even expound on or indulge in fantastical thinking about our counter measures in the event of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, because everything should be specifically calculated, he said.
And when we understand what our European and American partners are worthy of this time around, that is when we will make a decision about how to respond.
It will not be connected with door slamming, or some falsely understood grievances, the minister emphasized.
We, first and foremost, will be guided by our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business sector, and we will draw conclusions from our partners’ actions on the basis of their appropriateness, ability to come to an agreement, and reliability.
On the basis of the steps that have been taken in the area of sanctions, it’s possible to soundly judge what our partners are trying to accomplish”, the head of the Russian MFA continued.
If they are shouting at the top of their lungs that ‘they will also be sanctions for us, but we have to take such measures in order to punish Russia’, this is probably not very appropriate.”
As far as Russia’s leaving the WTO in response to potential new sanctions is concerned, the answer is no.
On the contrary, we want to more actively master the WTO instruments, including when the issue concerns trade disagreements, Lavrov stated.
We have already used this instrument in order to overcome what we see as discriminatory policies by the EU in the area of antidumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia has been accused of dumping, and, as such, antidumping measures have been taken against sectors of the Russian economy.
“We are also prepared to use WTO mechanisms in order to defend our position against introducing the norms of the EU’s third energy package retroactively”, Lavrov said.
