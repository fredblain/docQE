MFA of France: Paris’ position on the delivery of Mistrals to Russia remains unchanged
The official spokesperson for the French MFA, Roman Nadal, commented on Paris’ unchanged position on the delivery of Mistral class helicopter carrier ships to Russia.
"I can recall the President of the Republic’s (François Hollande) statement about them made in an interview with LeMonde newspaper on August 20: “Today, the level of sanctions do not prevent the delivery.
This is the decision of Europeans, and not France”, Mr. Nadal quoted to RIA Novosti.
That is how the representative of the French diplomatic agency answered a question about whether the worsening situation in Ukraine might cause a change in Paris’ position on filling the requirements of the contract
