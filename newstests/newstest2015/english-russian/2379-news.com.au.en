SW town of Harvey has fresh millionaire after Lotto win
A Harvey lotto player is in the month.
The search is on for a new millionaire in Perth's south-west, with one lucky person taking home nearly $1.1 million from Saturday night's lotto draw.
A Harvey newsagency struck gold in the division one draw for the second time in five years, the last being $1 million in November 2009.
However the lucky winner has yet to come forward.
Owner of the store Steve Forward said the win was creating a buzz around the small town in Perth's south west.
It's the talk of the town and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought a win like this might be close.
Eight WA winners have celebrated division one wins last month, capping off a lucky few weeks for the state's players.
Last week a Canning Vale player became one of five August millionaire's, following a Belmont couple's massive $7.5 million win only a few weeks prior.
The winning couple had played the game for twenty years and said the win gifted them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire brings WA up to 59 division one winners for the year, totalling in nearly $85 million.
