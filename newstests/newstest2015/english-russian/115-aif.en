What will be the effect of the introduction of quotas on domestic goods
No less than half of goods of every kind of item available in retail chain stores should be made in Russia, reckons State Duma Deputy, Oleg Nilov, from the, A Just Russia, faction.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protectionist measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.
The document will still undergo revision to avoid negative impacts on consumers.
It concerns goods that are not manufactured in Russia […]. For other types of goods, those that are manufactured in Russia, retailers will be obliged to make no less than half of their shelves available to domestic producers”, Nilov informed the publication.
Along with amendments to the law “On the basis of state regulation of commercial activity in the Russian Federation,” the bill requires the introduction of changes to the tax code, by decreasing the VAT rate to 10% upon the sale of goods produced in Russia.
The idea to introduce a 50% quota in retail chain stores is part of a package of stimulus measures for Russian producers.
The amount of domestic goods that will appear on store shelves will increase severalfold.
However, the initiative may have both a positive and negative effect, experts say.
According to Sergei Litvinenko, lawyer for the company, Nalogovik, and a member of Public Duma, an independent expert centre, the effect on the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and the food industries, will be positive and will lead to growth.
Agricultural producers, farmers, and small stores stand to gain.
They will be able to sell more, and that means that their profits will increase.
Furthermore, they will receive the right to dictate their prices and conditions to retailers, since retailers will be obliged to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase the scope of their operations and the volume of their sales, which will result in the payment of higher taxes than before.
This will increase fiscal revenues and create new jobs, certain industries will start to expand, some will find their feet faster than others, and it will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign foodstuffs will decline severalfold, but, of course, not immediately”, the expert notes.
Previously, Russian businesses were frequently unable to get their goods onto the shelves of local stores as a result of the high level of competition from foreign competitors.
Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche has been freed up and it’s possible to breathe a little more easily.
But it shouldn’t be forgotten that, after all of the necessary agreements and sanitary inspections have been completed, food commodities produced in Latin America, Turkey, and Serbia will hit the Russian market.
In other words, a "moment of calm" is at hand, when the previous players have already left, and the new ones haven’t yet arrived.
After almost a month, it is possible to talk about an increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as higher prices on finished products”, Tamara Kasyanova (PhD Econ.), First Vice-President of the All-Russian Public Organization, Russian Club of Financial Directors, told AiF.ru.
Without a doubt, the idea of selling a minimum of 50% of Russian food products in every category will make it possible to secure this sector for local producers.
In this case, they will be competing with each other, and not with goods that cost less as a result of subsidies from a different state.
In other words, competition for consumers will take place between companies that are doing business according to the same industry laws.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian producers are far from being able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of their compatriots in all respects.
And in a situation like this, retail chain stores will have to “strive” to ensure that at least half of their product assortment is comprised of Russian goods.
Accordingly, there is a growing fear that poor quality products will find their way onto store shelves.
It’s possible that foreign goods that are relabelled to make them appear as if they were made in Russia will be supplied”, the expert added.
Large retail chains will feel a negative effect from the introduction of quotas, especially those who find it advantageous to collaborate with importers.
It is logical that, in a situation like this, foreign suppliers themselves will also suffer, since demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko doesn’t discount that the law on quotas could also have an impact on consumers.
The fact is that some Russian-produced goods may be of a lower quality than their imported equivalents, and, as such, stores may jack up the price of the latter products, as if they were scarce commodities.
Import substitution, an idea that had been forgotten about since the beginning of the 2000s, was once again being talked about by economists in February of this year, as a result of the relentless devaluation of the rouble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of renouncing imported goods is becoming ever more relevant.
The law is intended to require retailers to reckon with domestic producers when placing orders with suppliers.
In this way, we will be on the road to import substitution much more quickly and with greater confidence, and a system for planning the production of essential types of goods will be created in a shorter period of time”, says Deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be especially effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly great, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports amounted to 25%.
Our farmers are entirely capable of wholly filling the shelves of Russian stores.
More over, meat production could also receive a powerful boost.
As is well known, beef maintains the highest import rate – from 30 to 35%.
This means that 65-70% still comes from Russian output”, Kasyanova reasons.
Experts support the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic goods will contribute to import substitution and may accelerate the process.
However, this one initiative on it’s own will not give rise to import substitution, considering that a whole set of measures is needed for that, Litvinenko is certain.
In any case, this initiative still allows for 50% of goods sold to be imported from abroad, and that means that wholesale import substitution will not take place, but a significant step in that direction will be accomplished.
After all, it’s not enough to establish quotas; we also need to get the production of domestic goods in this country back on track in order to fulfil those quotas.
These quotas will in fact provide such guarantees”, the expert asserts.
