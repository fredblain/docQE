A motorcycle has been seized after it was ridden at 125km/h in a 70km/h zone and through bushland to escape police in the Pilbara.
Traffic police on patrol in Karratha this morning tried to pull over a blue motorcycle when they spotted it reaching 125km/h as it pulled out of a service station on Bathgate Road.

The motorcycle and a person matching the description of the rider was then spotted at a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.

He is due to appear in Karratha Magistrates Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized and impounded for three months.
