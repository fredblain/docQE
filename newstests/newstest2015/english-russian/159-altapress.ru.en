A forest fire has erupted in Primorye as a result of thunderstorms
A dry thunderstorm caused the start of a forest fire within the territory of the Okhotnichy local forest area in the Pozharsky district of Primorsky Krai.
The organization of a task force and resources is underway at the site of the conflagration.
According to information from authorities at the regional special state-funded organization, Primorsky Airbase, conditions on the ground created by the fire require the use of airpower.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of the airbase:
An observer pilot on-board an An-2 patrol aircraft detected a fire, which began in a hard-to-reach area, over an area of 3 hectares.
Woody debris is burning on the remnants of the old scorched forest.
The overwhelming amount of debris in the area and a slope gradient of more than 45 degrees, as well as the absence of a suitable area for firefighter-troopers to land, are creating significant obstacles to putting out the fire.
An Mi-8 helicopter is needed.
The delivery of forces has been seriously hampered by the fact that the airbase only has an Mi-2 helicopter and an An-2 plane at its disposal.
Following the detection of the fire, 4 firefighter-troopers were strategically dropped at the fire suppression site.
The specialistsâ€™ main task is to put out the fire and prepare the area for the delivery of additional forces and firefighting resources.
Around lunchtime, a helicopter additionally delivered 3 firefighter-troopers to the area around the village of Okhotnichy.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the area of the fire is ready, specialists will be redeployed to the fire suppression site, according to the website of the Primorsky Krai administration.
