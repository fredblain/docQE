According to Southern Korean media, it happened at around 10:30 am local time from the direction of Chagang province, which is located on the border between North Korea and China.
Interfax was told by the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff that the missile presumably fell into the Sea of Japan after it had flown approximately 220 kilometres.
