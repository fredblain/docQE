Midfielder, Shinji Kagawa, returning to Borussia Dortmund from Manchester United, notes that he can’t wait to return to the pitch wearing the German club’s uniform.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in his career.
Of course, I am very happy that I will once again play for Borussia”, Bild cites Kagawa as saying.
I feel very good.
I am full of positive emotions and can’t wait to return to the pitch wearing the Borussia uniform.
To recall, Kagawa was transferred to MU from Borussia, in the summer of 2012, for 16 million euros.
However, he couldn’t quite find a place for himself in the English club, appearing in only 38 matches in the English League Championship over two seasons, scoring 6 goals and 8 assists.
