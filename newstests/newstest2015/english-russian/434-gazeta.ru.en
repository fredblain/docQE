The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The World Judo Championships held on home soil, brought Team Russia two silver and seven bronze medals.
Given these results, the Russians only gave way to the competition’s main favourites – Team Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, with the first day already bringing the Russian team a silver medal.
The award’s winner was Beslan Mudranov, who was competing in the 60kg class.
Furthermore, in the tied final fight with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the result of the match was decided by just one penalty, received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament turned out to be the most successful for Team Russia – three medals were won on Tuesday alone.
Mikhail Pulyaev, competing in the men’s 66kg class, achieved a silver medal, and the bronze went to Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final fight, the Russian went up against the Japanese 2011 and 2013 World Champion, Masashi Ebinuma.
Khan-Magomedov, having lost to his fellow countryman in the quarterfinals, successfully made it through repechage and won the bronze medal.
In the women’s 52kg tournament, Natalia Kyzyutina made it to the third spot on the podium.
She lost the semi-final to the current World Champion, Majlinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who competed under the flag of the International Judo Federation in this competition and successfully defended her title.
In the fight for the bronze, Kyzyutina defeated Ma Yingnan from China, but after the tournament, she admitted that third place was not at all what she was expecting.
Once again, Kelmendi, who earlier beat Kuzyutina in the final match of the European Championships, stood as an obstacle to the Russian’s road to gold.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Musa Mogushkov, competing in the 73kg class, added another bronze to Team Russia’s collection.
His opponent in the quarterfinals was Viktor Skovortsov, a former representative of Moldova who now competes for Team UAE.
But then, the Russian won two fights and became a medal winner.
Mogushkov entered the home championships with an injured ankle, which he plans to rehabilitate in the near future, and is why he will take a break from competing.
As concerns the ex-Moldovan competitor, Skvortsov, well he won himself a bronze medal in this tournament.
Interestingly, his other fellow countryman, Ivan Remarenko, who also took on sporting citizenship from the UAE, likewise finished his competition in the 100kg class with a bronze medal.
The fourth day of the 2014 WC also brought the Russians one bronze, won by Ivan Nifontov in the 81kg class.
In a difficult semi-final fight, he won against Frenchman, Alain Schmitt, as a result of a penalty against his opponent.
On Friday, three groups of medals were up for grabs at the tournament, but the Russians, as per tradition, were limited to just one bronze in the men’s 90kg class tournament.
The recipient was Kirill Voprosov, but Team Russia was guaranteed to win this medal: his opponent in the repechage final was fellow countryman, Kirill Denisov.
However, the actual fight was never held: Voprosov’s opponent wasn’t able to walk out onto the judo mat as a result of an injury.
A men’s bronze was also won by the home team on the sixth day of the competition – it was added to the team’s collection by Renat Saidov, who competed in the over 100kg class.
He achieved a clean win in the repechage final against the Brazilian, David Moura.
Thus ended the individual portion of the World Championships.
On Sunday, the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, the titles of world champions in the team competitions were up for grabs.
Both Russian teams – the men’s and the women’s – were amongst the top contenders for the award, but, as in the individual competitions, things didn’t work out for the representatives of the fairer sex – they didn’t achieve any medals.
But the Russian male judokas won the team silver.
In the deciding match of a hard-fought battle with a score of 2-3, they gave up first place to the competition favourites – Team Japan.
Moreover, Team Russia was leading 2-0 after the clean fight victory of Khan-Magomedov and the comeback win by Denis Yartsev (in the 73kg class).
However, in the heavier weight classes, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90), and Aslan Kambiev (100) weren’t able to defeat their Japanese opponents.
The same scenario played out in the bronze medal match of the women’s tournament, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, ended up losing 2-3 to the Japanese.
Russian President, Vladimir Putin, attended the team competitions in Chelyabinsk, and congratulated the men’s team with their silver medal following the closing of the tournament.
“Second place is very honourable, but I want to say that it was obvious you could become champions, Putin said according to RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the pioneers of judo – there is no shame in this.
But I am confident that you are also capable of beating them.
Team Russia’s performance at the World Championships on home soil was much better than last year’s showing at competitions of a similar calibre held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team only managed to get three medals under its belt – one silver and two bronze.
Moreover, this tournament was held without Olympian champions, Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev.
Of course, we are all big maximalists.
Yes, we want gold medals.
But let’s remember that if a person ends up in the top eight of an Olympic cycle, then they are considered a contender for an Olympic medal.
Especially, in a type of sport like judo”, Russian Minister of Sport, Vitaly Mutko, said in summing up the tournament, as reported by the press service for the Championships.
As predicted, Team Japan came out on top in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various value, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Championships will be held next summer in Astana.
