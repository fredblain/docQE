The 2012 Olympic Games bronze medallist in freestyle wrestling, Bilyal Makhov, may switch to Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was reported by Sazhid Sazhidov, Head Trainer of Freestyle Wrestling for Team Dagestan.
The expert didn’t exclude the possibility of the athlete’s participation in the World Championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Bilyal Makhov is a part of the "classical" team’s roster, R-Sport reports Sazhid Sazhidov as saying.
As a matter of fact, Bilyal competed in both styles at the junior level.
At the Junior World Championship in 2005, he won the freestyle tournament and took third place in the Greco-Roman competitions, and made a decision to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
There has long been talk that the next step in the career of our heavyweight would be a move to Greco-Roman wrestling.
I'll go even further: Makhov might even compete at the World Championship in Tashkent if he wins at try-outs.
But the final word will always go to the coaching staff, headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
