Captured fighters from the Donbass battalion are being dealt with in Donetsk Oblast.
The assailants were encircled outside of Ilovaisk.
Their own commanders betrayed them, and dozens of security forces were killed under fire.
They say that those who survived wouldn’t have gone to fight if they had known about the actual situation in the southeast of Ukraine.
You might call the 108 captives lucky.
The assailants from the Donbass battalion were still alive after the “bloodbath” they stumbled into outside of Ilovaisk.
They spent several days surrounded by fighters from the Donetsk People’s Republic army, basically abandoned by their commanders and authorities in Ukraine.
When command headquarters announced that it was possible to leave the “ring” through an allegedly granted corridor, the column made a move.
But after just a few minutes, the sound of shells and bullets could be heard from all directions.
“Judging by the information that they gave me, we had a corridor that they were going to let us leave by”, recalls the Temporary Deputy Commander of the battalion, who goes by the nom-de-guerre, “Lermontov”.
But when we started to descend between Mnogopolye and Chervonoselsk, the cross-fire coming from anti-tank guided missiles, "zushka" rocket-propelled artillery systems, 30mm grenade launchers, BMD automatic guns, and small arms began.
There were four vehicles travelling in front of me and three behind, but when it was all said and done, there were only two vehicles left.
The officer calling himself “Lermontov” recalls how, almost immediately, no fewer than 60 people were killed, dozens were wounded, many of whom later died.
The surviving fighters are currently receiving medical treatment from the very ones who came to kill them.
Now, the captives are surprised that these so-called “terrorists” are treating them well, giving them food and medicines.
Whereas, in contrast, their own commanders essentially deceived them, sentencing them to a certain death.
We were quite simply betrayed, they say.
The column, the whole battalion, was sent to the slaughter.
Aleksei, like many of his comrades, volunteered to join the Donbass battalion, given how Ukrainian news was describing the atrocities that were allegedly being caused by the “separatists” in Southeastern Ukraine.
Here, Aleksei finally saw a very different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk, not just by anyone, but by Ukrainian soldiers.
A friend phoned me, and told me that a mortar attack was underway, and that it was most likely the Ukrainian armed forces, recounts one of the soldiers, Aleksei.
After that, I wanted to leave the battalion.
They wouldn’t let us leave Ilovaisk, they said that we were surrounded.
I had already come to an agreement with my commander, and had already written a discharge report.
They transported the whole lot of us straight from Zurakhovo to Ilovaisk.
According to the captives, 300-350 people were stuck in the “trap” outside of Ilovaisk.
Now, some of the survivors admit that if they could turn back time, they wouldn’t have joined the counterinsurgency battalion under any circumstances.
The rebels handed over all of the captives to DPR security forces.
Each of them is being checked for their participation in war crimes.
