Russian tennis player, Maria Sharapova, who lost to Caroline Wozniacki in a fourth-round match at the US Open, considers that she didn’t have enough consistency.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish off the year well and try to reach a new level, reports Vasily Osipov from New York.
How would you assess your results at the Grand Slam tournaments this year?
Of course I am happy that I managed to win at Roland Garros.
But as far as the other three tournaments are concerned, I didn’t have enough consistency, especially towards the end of some of the matches.
Right now, of course, I’m upset.
After all, I didn’t even make it to the quarterfinals.
What goals have you set for yourself for the rest of the season?
After this bitter defeat, I have huge motivation to attain a new level.
I have something to work toward, and I intend to do everything possible to finish off the year well.
The Asian series of tournaments starts in just a couple weeks.
