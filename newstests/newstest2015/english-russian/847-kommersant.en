The iPhone will be turned into a wallet
In the run-up to September 9, when Apple is set to introduce its new developments, more leaks about what to expect from the presentation have started to appear in the press.
With reference to sources, the American media reports that the sixth generation iPhone will be fitted with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project between Apple and Visa, MasterCard, and American Express payment systems.
According to information from Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource, Re/code, at the September 9th presentation on new products, among other things, there may be an announcement about the joint project with the Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, which has resulted in the availability of a mobile wallet function on the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse to make any comments on this issue.
This function will make it possible to complete a transaction at a till using a smartphone.
The user will complete authorization of the payment by using his or her fingerprint with the help of the TouchID function.
It’s being reported that this iPhone will be the very first with built-in NFC (near field communication) technology, which makes it possible to complete contactless payments using a smartphone and a corresponding reading device at the till.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company, NXP (previously Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was featured for the very first time in 2004, within a framework of cooperation between Sony, Nokia, Phillips Semiconductors, and more than a hundred other companies, included in the so-called NFC Forum – an association for the further development of this technology.
Nokia released the first phone with NFC in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with an NFC function was the Samsung Nexus S, introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which enables users to link bankcards to their Google profile and make payments using an Android smartphone.
However, American experts emphasize that, in spite of the massive investments made by high-tech companies into NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about the innovation and are not all that excited about spending money to equip their stores with these systems.
As such, observers are now hoping that Apple’s entry into this market will force retailers to hurry up and quickly introduce this technology into their retail stores.
