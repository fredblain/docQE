Inflation has returned from vacation.
Will Russian citizens feel a sharp rise in prices
Inflation in Russia will accelerate and exceed the government’s earlier forecast, as a result of reciprocal sanctions between Russia and the West, analysts from VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed ramifications of the anti-sanctions will lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, RBC Daily writes.
As per the most recent forecast from the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, inflation in 2014 will amount to 6.5-7.5%, and will be even less next year, at 6.5%.
However, according to information from Kommersant newspaper, the MEDT is supposed to make “small, but fundamental” corrections to its macroeconomic forecast up until 2017.
According to the publication’s information, the agency may lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will make it possible to eliminate the expected zero-growth in household incomes.
The forecast assumed that Russia’s sanctions on food commodities would last for one year, up until August 2015.
How was it possible to anticipate such high inflation in a situation like this?
The current situation suggests a one-time shock, but the overall downward trend in inflation remains unchanged,” claims the newspaper’s source in the Ministry of Finance.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government’s financial economic bloc regarding inflation, and forecast an increase in prices of around 8% in 2014.
The main impact of the food bans will come into effect at the same time as the possible introduction, in 2015, of a sales tax throughout the Russian Federation, experts are convinced.
An inflationary peak of 9% will come in February, after which the annual rate of inflation will start to fall, experts suggest.
Incidentally, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflation data since Russia introduced its “measured sanctions”.

Artem Deev, Head of the Analytical Department at the financial company, AForex:
A rise in prices can already be seen within the core segment of goods.
Moreover, when socially significant goods started to increase in price, the government was forced to enact measures for the systematic monitoring of price stability in order to avert the risk of an unreasonable increase in prices in the short-term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting to regulatory agencies on a daily basis so that the authorities know precisely who is triggering a rise in prices, when it is happening, and on what grounds.
The colossal rate of capital flight, the exorbitant refinancing of the Russian banking sector by Russia’s mega-regulator, domestic conversion as a result of the population’s run on foreign currency, as well as the embargo on the import of foodstuffs from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia, continue to be key factors in the rising consumer price index.
If inflationary pressures had remained under control, then the cost for the minimum basket of goods would not have jumped by 12% in just one quarter.
The embargo on the import of foodstuffs provoked a supply shock on the internal market and led to an entirely rational increase in final costs.
Since, at this stage, we will not be able to fully implement an import substitution plan or increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, reciprocal sanctions will continue to carry a risk of increasing inflationary elements.
If we then include fiscal factors associated with the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the worsening prospects for economic growth, then by the end of this year, inflation could very well exceed 8%.

In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% a month, and, in the 2000s, it was still higher than the current level, but this was quite a different matter given that inflation was offset by rapid economic growth.
I think that by the end of the year, inflation will be at 8-8.5%.

The external factor, connected with the sanctions against Russia, has so far been contained, but if further pressure is applied, most critically, to the financial sector, then it could lead to significant difficulties and increase the public’s inflationary expectations, which usually, and traditionally, manifest in the purchase of foreign exchange cash in order to safeguard one’s savings.
One can expect that the government, the Russian Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance will attempt to mitigate the continuous weakening of the rouble by using market measures and government regulation.
But prices traditionally start to rise after the summer lull, and it is possible that this fall it will become even more perceptible.
The target level of 7.5% for consumer inflation in Russia will likely stand, given that the Russian Federation still has financial savings at its disposal.
