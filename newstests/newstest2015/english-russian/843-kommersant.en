“City Without Drugs” is left without a suit
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed without prejudice a lawsuit by the Administrative Directorate of the Regional Ministry for the Administration of State Property against the City Without Drugs Foundation.
The agency intended to recover more than 7 mln. roubles by way of payment for the lease of a building in the centre of Yekaterinburg.
However, the claimant failed to show up to court on two occasions.
Today, the Arbitration Court for Sverdlovsk Oblast dismissed without prejudice a lawsuit by the Administrative Directorate of the Ministry for the Administration of State Property (MUGISO) against the City Without Drugs Foundation (one of whose founders is the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect 7.3 mln. roubles from the organization as payment for the lease of a building.
Today, it came to light that the claimant failed to appear in court twice, which is why the decision was made to deny the hearing.
We were unable to clarify the reason for the absence of representatives from the Directorate of the MUGISO, as the Head of the Legal Department, Maksim Titov, wasn’t answering phone calls.
We were also unable to get in contact with representatives from the Foundation.
As a reminder, the issue at hand concerns the mansion at 19 Belinsky Street in the centre of the city, where the Foundation has been located on a free-of-charge basis since 2011.
The previous Governor, Aleksandr Misharin, made this decision.
In November 2012, the Administrative Directorate of the Ministry for the Administration of State Property for Sverdlovsk Oblast filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court to evict the Foundation from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the agency sought, via the courts, a declaration that the contract for the free-use of the premises of the historical mansion was void.
According to the Directorate of the MUGISO, the material terms for the lease of the cultural heritage site were not written in the contract.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the lawsuit and then an appeal was lodged with the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was granted.
Then, in the same court, the Foundation filed a cassation appeal against the decision which did not receive approval; this decision then was appealed by the Foundation in the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court sided with the Directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded, according to which the Foundation started to pay rent; head of the city, Yeveny Roizman, spoke about this.
The rental fee was set at 300 thou. roubles a month.
The previous regional administration gave us free-use of this building, in recognition of our achievements in the fight against drugs, and as a sign of respect for the Foundation.
The current administration decided differently”, he stated.

Why the Mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to voluntarily resign
On July 24, United Russia Deputy for the Yekaterinburg City Duma, Aleksandr Kosintsev, suggested that the Mayor and Speaker of the City Duma, Yevgeny Roizman, resign.
The reason for this being the criminal case against City Duma Deputy, Oleg Kinev, who was arrested as a suspect in the murder of a female pensioner, and who is deemed a close associate of the mayor.
How they found a criminal case against Evgeny Roizman
On July 1, it came to light that a criminal case had been initiated in connection with “slander” (Art. 128.1 of the Russian Criminal Code) in the blog of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Roizman.
This was reported by the Main Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior for Sverdlovsk Oblast, to whom the General Director of the Protection Centre for Rights, Anna Filatova, appealed with corroborating documents.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her, in his blog entries, of participating in crimes that were allegedly committed by her ex-spouse.
The Mayor of Yekaterinburg is confident that “this is yet another attempt to avenge the truth”.
