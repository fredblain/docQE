The inventor of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer, Nicky Case, known for the Coming Out Simulator, has decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case began working on the game several weeks ago, but it only became widely known about just now.
Inspiration for the game came from the events in Ferguson, where protests, which began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager, are currently underway.
The focus of the project, which, as of yet, has no title, will be about how news coverage of stories influences their consequences.
The game’s main character, a citizen journalist, will need to photograph events in areas where confrontations between police and the population are underway.
The main character can photograph what is happening in different ways, which will impact how events unfold.
If they shoot the scene in a way that makes the police look like the heroes and the protesters like bandits, then the police will start to treat them better and allow them into places a normal person isn’t allowed to enter.
If they present events in a different manner, their photographs can turn peaceful protests into a massive riot.
Points in the game will have to be earned using the main character’s Twitter account, which will attract new subscribers if the photographs posted there turn out to be popular.
The game, as of yet, has no title.
The release date and the platforms it will be available on are unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how an event can change depending on how you take and process a photograph of it.
In the interview with Kill Screen, Case explained how he came up with the idea for this game quite a while ago, however, he had originally wanted to base it not on protests in the USA, but on events in the Gaza strip.
After starting to collect information for the game, the game designer admitted that he didn’t have enough knowledge or expertise to portray the history of the region.
However, when he saw how the media was presenting the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on the incident.
Nicky Case is an independent designer who produces browser games.
Coming Out Simulator, which was released in 2014, became his is best-known project.
This game, which addresses events from Case’s own biography, focuses on how a bisexual teenager attempts to tell his homophobic parents about his relationships.
