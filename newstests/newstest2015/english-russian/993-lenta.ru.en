The Ministry of Communications has proposed to allocate 250 million roubles to Crimea television and radio broadcasting company
The Ministry of Communications has proposed to allocate 250 million roubles from the federal budget in 2014 to the independent non-profit organization, Crimea television and radio broadcasting company.
This is discussed in a government draft decree prepared by the agency, with which Lenta.ru has familiarized itself.
According to the draft’s explanatory notes, the subsidies from the federal budget will be allocated “to cover the costs of creating the conditions for widespread informational coverage of the social and economic situation and the development of a modern information space within the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
A portion of the money has been earmarked for upgrading the broadcasting studio, video walls, the main control room, and the video equipment room.
The purchase of a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter are also being planned.
Furthermore, the company will use the allocated funds to pay for the use of a fibre-optic communications line and repairs to the energy system.
The subsidies will be made available as part of the federal budget resources that are set aside for the Ministry of Communications.
The state television and radio broadcasting company, Crimea, founded in 1959, provides broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tartar, German, Greek, Bulgarian, and Armenian.
Currently, the television and radio broadcasting company’s television signal reaches more than 75 percent of the peninsula’s territory.
In 2011, Crimea television and radio broadcasting company received its digital television broadcasting licence.
