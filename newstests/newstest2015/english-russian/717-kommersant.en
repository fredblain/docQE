A “europrotocol” instead of a certificate from the STSI
It will be possible to receive payouts from fully comprehensive vehicle insurance policies without a certificate from the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate – the Central Bank is determined to stimulate the implementation of European Accident Reports or “europrotocols” in Russia by such means.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft directive according to which, starting from September 1 of this year, an insured driver would be able to receive a payout from a fully comprehensive vehicle insurance policy without a certificate from the STSI.
Truth be told, this issue only concerns those situations where an accident is processed using a “europrotocol” without the involvement of the road police.
In other words, only in cases where two vehicles are involved in a motor vehicle accident, there are no injured individuals, the damage does not exceed a set limit, and both drivers have reached a consensus as to who is at fault in the accident.
From August 2 on, the payout limit for accidents processed using a “europrotocol” amounts to 50 thou. roubles; whereas, on October 1, the limit will be raised to 400 thou. roubles in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, as well as in both Moscow and Leningrad Oblasts.
The issue is that, more often than not, even in a situation where there is only minor damage and the motor vehicle accident could be processed using a “europrotocol”, the drivers who have gotten into the accident still call the STSI.
After all, it wasn’t possible to receive repayment from a fully comprehensive vehicle insurance policy without a certificate from the STSI.
The parameters prescribed in the draft directive specifically call for the removal of this barrier on the road to the implementation of the “europrotocol” in Russia.
In accordance with them, the maximum payout on a fully comprehensive vehicle insurance policy for a motor vehicle accident that is processed without STSI officers, should not be lower than the limit for an accident processed using a “europrotocol”.
But, at the same time, it cannot be higher than the limit set out in the contract of the fully comprehensive vehicle insurance policy.
The idea is, without a doubt, useful and, in theory, could free up both STSI officers and the roads.
But, it’s not likely to be met with delight from either drivers or insurers.
The latter are already talking about the serious threat of an increase in fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules on payouts for fully comprehensive vehicle insurance policies.
As far as drivers are concerned, it’s hard to imagine exactly what kind of work would have to be done to overcome our long-standing Russian conservatism.
The driver, in the majority of cases, will wait hours for an officer to process a minor accident, just because it is more reliable.
It’s still not clear what will be easier: defeating the fraudsters or convincing drivers of the reliability of the “europrotocol”.
The savings certificate will be made registered and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban bearer savings certificates, but allow banks to offer an irrevocable deposit as a substitute.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a draft bill, which would ban bearer savings certificates.
Lately, this instrument has gained popularity, since the rates are higher than those paid on bank deposits.
The issue is that bearer savings certificates are not covered by the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for a bank to offer since it doesn’t have to contribute funds to the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).
The poignancy of the situation is that plans to take this step were made as a result of small and medium-size banks distributing these certificates, but it is Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which according to DIA estimates control 98% of the niche market, that will suffer as a result.
Moreover, Bank of Moscow’s share, according to the agency’s estimates, amounts to around 3.5%.
The issue, the DIA explains, is that clients of a small bank who have purchased this certificate might try to get money from the DIA in a case where the bank’s license is revoked.
Some investors don’t have a sufficient level of financial understanding and, when purchasing bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.
The legitimate absence of insurance compensation for such certificates, in a case where a bank’s licence is revoked, might lead to misunderstanding and social unrest.
The agency has dealt with actual situations where the holders of bearer certificates have attempted to collect insurance compensation through the courts”, the DIA stated.
The problem, of course, is far-fetched.
After all, no one will ever pay the buyers of such certificates since they don’t have any rights under the law to seek compensation from the state.
If the issue was that the instrument isn’t insured by the DIA, then they also would have banned metal accounts, in which citizens’ wealth is recorded according to grams of one of four metals: gold, silver, platinum, and palladium.
After all, these accounts also are not covered by the deposit insurance system, but so far no one is trying to snuff them out.
Most likely, the issue is that these bearer certificates are a very convenient valuable security, which can basically be used as quasi-money.
Moreover, their movement is almost uncontrollable: any client of a bank can buy the certificate and hand it over to any other citizen, and, until it is converted into cash, this certificate can change hands between a multitude of owners.
It is no accident that the wording of the draft bill requires that a savings certificate be a registered security that is held at a depository institution.
But, in order to sweeten the deal for the banks, these certificates can be issued without the right to early redemption.
In other words, bankers will finally get an equivalent to the irrevocable deposit that they have long been dreaming about.
