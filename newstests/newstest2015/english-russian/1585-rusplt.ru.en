How people live in the oldest house in Ufa
There are 18 apartments in the former home of gold producers and mine owners, Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov, located at 57/1 October Revolution Street (formerly Bolshaya Kazanskaya).
The 18th century home has remained practically unchanged since it was built, except for the disrepair that is.
Strangers come here as if on a tour, but the residents suffer more than they are pleased by their privilege: the right to live in the oldest home in Ufa, the walls of which remember the likes of General Aleksandr Suvorov.
The exact date of house’s construction is not clear, but historians point to two dates: 1730 and 1737.
In either case, it works out that the building is just shy of 300 years.
There’s the old courtyard, the always-open door, the creaky staircase.
The apartment doorways are close together, the walls have cracked, and the street is visible through the occasional gaps in the crumbling plaster.
It seems as if everything is hanging on by a thread.
But the local residents insist: “It doesn’t just seem that way to you – it really is that way”.
It’s difficult living in a wooden home from the 18th century, says Tatiana Lukyanova, resident of Apartment No.3.
The building is on the state’s list of protected structures, but no money has been allocated for its upkeep for several decades, and we feel as if we are pieces in a museum, which the authorities have simply forgotten about.
The last renovation took place 40 years ago.
The walls are still somewhat holding together, but the foundation has totally rotted out.
Many residents still have to go outside to use the toilet, and they wash themselves once a week at the public bathhouse.
How could anyone be pleased with these kinds of conditions?!
The road runs directly outside of the windows, there isn’t even a pedestrian area.
Tatiana moves the curtains to the side.
Now it’s possible to see what before was only audible: right outside the windows, traffic rushes past.
See, the glass is constantly rattling, we can’t open the windows, but we’ve gotten used to the noise.
A person can get used to anything, the good and the bad.
Our apartment is actually a shining example, thanks to my husband; he is good with his hands.
Moreover, we have two rooms, and there’s just the three of us with my son.
But other families live in much worse conditions: on the second floor the ceiling is not much more than a meter and a half high.
For the sake of contrast, Tatiana suggests paying a visit to her neighbour from Apartment No. 6, Lyudmila Starostina.
The friendly and hospitable woman immediately offers us a cup of coffee and, with a sad smile, recounts:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m² for four people – this is how we live: myself and my husband, our daughter and granddaughter.
I’ve lived here since I was born, we never had any other living space, Lyudmila gives us a guided tour of the room with her eyes: entresols, two sectional sofas, her granddaughter is sitting with her laptop on one of them.
It’s very cramped and hardly differs from the typical domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, “historic”.
But the ceilings often leak – the plumbing is in a sore state.
Lyudmila speaks in both a mundane and wondrous manner about her apartment, like an Italian whose home stands on Roman ruins.
That is to say, combing the very old and the recent, the every-day and the legendary, into one and the same thing:
The plumbing was installed around 40 years ago during the time of the last renovation.
That was also when they made us a kitchen in the cubbyhole and a toilet from the former closet.
We actually live right where Demidov and his family lodged, and the servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment isn’t privatized, but what’s the difference?
They say that there is no point in privatizing real estate in the centre of Ufa.
We would still only get a one-room apartment; we couldn’t seek any more than that.
Just four months ago they promised to relocate us, but it didn’t go any further than just promises.
I’m not used to complaining and I won’t do it.
A whole dynasty has lived in this apartment (room!): my grandmother and grandfather, my mom and dad, my husband and I, and my daughter and granddaughter.
So much has happened during this time.
For example, there were ginormous rats that ran all over the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing – they’re a meter thick!
They say that the mixture was made with eggs and that’s why it has been standing for so long.
The house was built well, thanks to the Demidovs!
It’s probably the only reason why no one yet has been killed by a collapsed ceiling or post.
Only the building is still slowly dying right in front of our eyes: the house’s wooden planks and beams are rotting, the floors have caved in several times, we poured cement, but all to no avail – the mixture just seeps into the ground, like pouring it into a manhole.
They say that that’s exactly it – underneath our room is a secret passageway and exit to the Belaya River, which was specially built by some old believers who lived here at one time, so that they could take refuge in case of danger.
They were being persecuted.
Lyudmila Starostina recalls how some historian came and pleaded with them to let him in so that he could start excavations in the apartment.
And then he tried to persuade them to give him their apartment in exchange for his one-room apartment on October Avenue.
Lyudmila declined the historian’s offer:
What would the four of us have done in a one-room apartment?
And here there’s at least a glimmer of hope that they’ll give us more spacious accommodations.
You have to agree that we would have come out the losers if we had agreed to that exchange.
However, the Starostin family hasn’t won anything either.
Lyudmila’s biggest dream is to be relocated, and that her daughter with her 16 year-old granddaughter would be given a room of their own.
In other words, that the two families are allocated a two-room apartment in place of the less than majestic ruin in which the two generations currently reside.
A petite, nice-looking young lady, Olesia Karsakova from Apartments No. 11 and No. 12, shows us the second story of the house.
There, in two cramped little rooms called apartments, with a total area of 23 m², lives her large family.
Altogether, there are seven of us, two being children.
You can see for yourself what conditions are like.
The plaster is falling off in chunks and the window frames are just as bad, the walls in the kitchen and other rooms have holes that reach all the way through to the outside.
The water from the tap only runs cold all year round.
Having walked through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, it is evident that the Lavrentev couple from Apartment No. 4 are the luckiest of the lot.
They reside in the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You’re right, there’s lots of space!
Three people are registered at this 75 square meter premises.
We reside in the very same rooms where, as legend has it, Suvorov stayed during his time spent in Ufa, says the head of the family, Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentev.
The ceilings are high and spacious.
The only downside: everything around us is falling apart at the seams, collapsing, crumbling.
The neighbours have probably already told you about this!
The biggest bother for us is the floors: the wooden boards are rotten, the soil is literally coming up under one’s feet.
I’ve installed props and wedges; the hall isn’t so bad, but when we’re walking in other rooms it’s like we’re riding on the swing, because it’s so shaky.
Aleksandr Dmitrievich can talk about the home of the merchant, Evdokim Demidov, better than any tour guide.
He treats the gold producer as if he were a relative, and talks about him admiringly.
Indeed, this character had a lot going for him: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzyansk factories built homes, cast canons and bells, and kept the Ural mines.
The heirs to the merchant’s real estate take pride in their forefather, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.
I moved here when I was still a child, in the 1940s, said Aleksandr Dmitrievich.
Back then there were wooden structures all around, for the carriage, stables, and watch houses, but later on they were knocked down.
In 1968, they even wanted to demolish our house, but something got in the way….
History repeated itself in 2014: once again a new home beckoned.
We, as if by command, collected all the documents, ran around to all of the necessary authorities, and then, suddenly, we found out that the move was being postponed until 2015 or 2016.
There’s something we no longer believe in all this….
Two years ago, Lavrentev went to the Ministry of Culture for the Republic of Bashkortostan in order to find out about the fate of the house.
The bureaucrats wouldn’t see the residents.
They sent me from one desk to another, and then, as if in mockery, issued me a piece of paper without a signature or a stamp that said: "The Ministry of Culture is not adverse to the resettlement of the residents".
I even have the sense that our house hasn’t been in the city plan for quite some time now, after all, at first it was No. 57, and then it became 57 A, and now it’s 57/1.
As if they had already torn it down in the 1970s.
Russian Planet contacted the Head of the Informational and Analytical Works Section of the Land Resource Department for Ufa, Vladimir Barabash.
The house at 57/1 October Revolution Street is included in the programme for the resettlement of dilapidated housing.
I can’t answer for the actions of bureaucrats in the 1970s, I only know that back then there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, regardless of their historical importance.
Thankfully, this didn’t happen, and there is a decree from the current authorities to restore all of the historic buildings on October Revolution Street that have architectural merit, which is being successfully implemented.
It is planned to resettle the residents in new apartments in the near future.
According to Barabash, Italian specialists, who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice, will restore the Demidov House.
Right now, in Italy, an architectural biennial is underway, and the "Old Ufa" project is being represented there along with others.
I hope that, by 2016, all of the former Staraya Kazanskaya Street will be fully resorted, the bureaucrat says.
The homes will be given an appropriate appearance that corresponds with what they would have looked like before, three centuries ago.
The Demidov House will most probably become a museum that will be open to the public.
Furthermore, a decision has been made at the government level to make the street a pedestrian zone on weekends.
Unfortunately, it wouldn’t work during the week, as the city’s streets are too congested.
Vladimir Barabash promises that the resettlement of those people living in the future museum will happen in 2015.
However, it’s unlikely that they will end up being satisfied: their new apartments will be the same size as their current ones.
However, they’ll be from a different epoch.
