The 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first Dervish Convoy was observed in Arkhangelsk
The rally, which was held in the regional centre, was dedicated to the first Arctic convey.
The Dervish delivered military aid from the USA and Great Britain to the USSR.
The remembrance ceremony in Arkhangelsk took place at the foundation stone for the future monument to participants in the northern convoys, which is located on Sedov Embankment in Solombala.
Representatives from Arkhangelsk’s veteran organizations and children from a cadet troupe gathered at the event.
The first time we came together was twenty-three years ago when the foundation stone was laid.
At the same time, today’s events are not a celebration, but rather a day of remembrance for those who never returned from sea”, noted the Chair of the Council of Veterans for the Northern Shipping Company, Boris Karpov.
After that, the city’s military band performed at the event, and members from the cadet troupes presented flowers to the veterans and marched with the Russian flag and the Victory Banner.
The rally ended with the placing of flowers at the foundation stone.
The convey itself was comprised of five English vessels and one Dutch transport ship, which were loaded with strategically important materials (10,000 tonnes of natural rubber, 1,500 tonnes of regulation boots, tin metal, and wool, and a variety of other gear and equipment).
Moreover, military equipment and weapons were also on-board the vessels – 3,800 depth charges and magnetic mines and 15 disassembled Hurricane fighter planes.
As such, the convey escort consisted of 16 British navy ships, including two aircraft carriers.
The convoy of vessels was not intercepted by the enemies and safely made it to its destination – Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships that took part in the operation of these vitally important convoy missions, 126 transport ships and approximately 50 warships were destroyed.
