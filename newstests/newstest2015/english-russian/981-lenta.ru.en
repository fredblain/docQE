The ICR has ended the investigation into the Tu-204 accident at Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (ICR) has dropped criminal charges in relation to the accident involving the Tu-204 airplane owned by Red Wings airlines.
The agency’s press service reported this.
The decision was made in relation to the death of the captain and the on-board engineer.
The forensic investigation showed that the accident was caused by an accelerated landing approach, the failure of the crew to comply with standard landing procedures, as well as an unintentional forward thrust increase of the engines.
The Tu-204 airplane owned by Red Wings airlines, which was travelling from Prague to Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012, while landing at Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport.
The aircraft overran the landing strip and burst into flames.
The captain, co-pilot, and on-board engineer all died at the scene of the accident.
Two flight attendants were sent to medical treatment facilities, where they later died from their injuries.
Another three flight attendants, who were hospitalized with serious bodily injuries, underwent long-term medical care.
Furthermore, a driver of a car, who was travelling along Kievskoe highway at the moment of the accident, received serious bodily injuries.
There were no passengers on-board the aircraft.
The transport prosecutor’s office conducted an investigation into Red Wings following the accident, in which numerous violations were found.
In February 2013, the airline company’s license was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
