Anger turns out the be the most universal and functional of human emotions
An angry facial expression turns out to be biologically universal to all of humankind, and every organ and muscle that participates in the creation of this expression is not accidental, but rather an additional means of expressing power and intimidation, scholars from Australia and the USA have discovered.
They discuss their discoveries in the journal, Evolution and Human Behavior, but a summary of them can be read in a press release from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
An angry facial expression – knitted and downcast brows, lips stretched into a thin line, flared nostrils – is the same across all cultures, and even congenitally blind children, having never seen it before, do it, notes the study’s lead author, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project devoted to the nature of anger, scholars discovered that this emotion was developed to effectively manage disputes during a conflict.
The greater one’s ability to cause physical injury to another, the more opportunities one has to dictate their terms, and a person is able to convey this to their interlocutor through anger.
The researchers also found confirmation of their other hypothesis: physically strong people become angry more frequently and are more likely to resort to physical force, they consider themselves entitled to dictate unfavourable terms to others, and they prefer forceful rather then peaceful means to resolving conflicts.
Starting from the notion that anger is primarily a “bargaining emotion”, the scholars decided that the movement of each of the seven groups of muscles that create an angry facial expression should make the angry person look more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of their interlocutor, thereby forcing agreement with the angry person’s demands as quickly as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers created a computerized facial model, to which they added or removed each of the seven elements of an angry face, and then showed it to their test subjects.
Although downcast eyebrows or a pushed out chin on their own didn’t make the face look malicious, study participants unanimously recognized an image of a more physically strong person with the same characteristics as being such.
Human anger, just as in animals, conveys a threat: an exaggerated expression of one’s personal strength that compels others to consent and obey.
A person flares their nostrils and presses their lips together for the same reason that a frog puffs itself up, or a baboon bares its teeth.
“Anger is ‘triggered’ when an interlocutor declines to accept the situation, and the face immediately takes on a form that is maximally effective in demonstrating to the opposing side the consequences of that refusal.
But what’s most astonishing is that not one of the components of an angry face is arbitrary, they all express the very same message”, anthropologist, John Tooby notes.
