Deputies have proposed accelerating the entry into force of the law on personal data
In the event of the initiative’s success, the storage of personal data of Russian citizens on servers outside of the country will not be permitted from January 1, 2015 on
A bill, which seeks to change the date of the entry into force of the already approved law on the personal data of Russian citizens from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015, has been introduced in the State Duma.
The initiative is on the legislative docket of the lower chamber.
Its authors are State Duma deputies Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parakhin (A Just Russia) and Aleksandr Yushchenko (CPRF).
This change, according to the authors of the initiative, will support a more timely and effective enforcement of the rights of Russian citizens as concerns the storage of personal data and the confidentiality of private correspondence on information and telecommunication networks.
The law, whose entry into force parliamentarians are trying to hasten, requires that the personal data of Russian citizens created on-line be stored within the Russian Federation.
It also requires that the recording, categorization, accumulation, storage, updating, and retrieval of personal data of Russian citizens be on databases that are located within the territory of the Russian Federation, and that information about the location of such databases be provided.
Moreover, the law grants Roskomnadzor with the power, based on a court ruling, to restrict access to information gathered in contravention to Russian law in the area of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called “black lists” of sites violating the automated information system: “List of violators of the rights of the subjects of personal data”.
The State Duma passed this law in the summer.
Andrei Lugovoi and Vadim Dengin from LDPR and Aleksandr Yushchenko from CPRF were the authors of the bill.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also two of the authors of the current bill that aims to push forward the date of the entry into force of the already passed law.
Those who do not have data centres within Russia will have to lease them
Commenting on the bill introduced in the State Duma today, Deputy Head of the Duma Committee for Information Policy, Leonid Levin, stated that he sees no problem with changing the date of the entry into force of the law on the storage of personal data.
According to him, those companies that won’t have their own facilities for the storage of personal data of Russian citizens within the Russian Federation by January 1, 2015, will be able to lease them, for example, “from Rostelekom, who have many times said that they are prepared to offer their servers for lease and who have already made their servers available, or from Mail Group, or from Western companies who currently are already making their servers available”.
“Additionally, there are several independent data centres that are willing to cooperate in this area”, he added.
“If companies decide to abide by the law and continue to work within the Russian Federation, then I don't see any problem with it – they will receive the technical capabilities they require to function”, Levin summed up.
A controversial bill
Immediately following the publication of the bill, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications warned that if the bill were to pass, Russian citizens wouldn’t be able to use many global internet services anymore.
In part, this refers to online booking services for airline tickets and hotels.
According to the Association, “the bill denies subjects of personal data – citizens of the Russian Federation – control over their own personal information, by mandatorily determining that the recording, categorization, and so forth of this information should only take place in databases that are located within the Russian Federation”.
In its announcement, the RAEC emphasizes that a more effective measure would have been to create a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording, categorization, and so forth of his or her personal information is being carried out.
In this way, a person could choose for himself or herself where the operation in question will be carried out.
The passing of similar bills on the “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the departure of global service providers and economic losses.
