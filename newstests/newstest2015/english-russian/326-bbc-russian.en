The military governor and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prayuth Chan-ocha announced the composition of the new cabinet of ministers for the country, in which more than a third of positions are held by either generals or retired generals.
Members of the army received key positions: ministers of defence, finance, foreign affairs, and trade.
On Monday, Prayuth Chan-ocha was officially confirmed in the position of prime minister, following official approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of the head of the interim military government to that post.
The 60 year-old military man, who seized control of the country following a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for the post of prime minister.
He was chosen as the prime minister during a session of parliament.
Earlier, the army appointed the members of parliament.
According to Prayuth Chan-ocha, a coup was the only way to ensure stability.
It was preceded by six-month long demonstrations, in which those protesting demanded the resignation of the government’s Prime Minister, Yingluck Shinawatra.
Officially, Prayuth Chan-ocha will be the temporary prime minister, since army leaders plan to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are concerns that military leaders plan to consolidate their power over the country.
The army came to power on May 22
against the backdrop of a totally paralysed civil government.
The leaders of the main political parties were subjected to temporary arrest.
Immediately following the military leaders’ seizure of power, they began the temporary arrest of the country’s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
Those arrested included several journalists and public figures.
The current political crisis traces its roots back to 2006, when the army removed Yingluck Shinawatra’s brother, Thaksin, from his post as prime minister.
Both of them are popular with the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which brought them success several times at the polls.
However, many members of the middle class and the elite in the capital joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralysed the country since November 2013.
