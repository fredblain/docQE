Crimea television and radio broadcasting company might receive 250 mln. roubles in subsidies
The Russian Ministry of Communications is proposing to allocate 250 mln. roubles to the state television and radio broadcasting company, Crimea, in 2014.
As it appears from the Ministry of Communications’ draft decree, which is available on the unified portal for the disclosure of information on regulatory documents, the subsidies are intended to be spent “to cover the costs of creating the conditions for widespread informational coverage of the social and economic situation and the development of a modern information space within the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also go toward the purchase of equipment and payment for renovations to the roof and electrical system of the building of the television and radio broadcasting company, which was founded in 1959, reports RIA Novosti.
