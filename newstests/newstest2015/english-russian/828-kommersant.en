Boredom is a sin
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For, accomplished a totally different revolution than one might have expected it to.
The first Sin City (2005), shot with the minimal, but symbolic, participation of Quentin Tarantino, accomplished a revolution in the relationship between film, comics, and noir fiction.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys a formula that is fundamental to modern thinking, “thesis – antithesis – synthesis” (if we understand thesis to mean the universe of noir, and antithesis to mean space comics).
From now on, it will have to be read as follows: “thesis – antithesis – chaos”.
Sin City 2 is chaotic both on a dramatic and philosophical level: it is chaotic in the idiotic sense of the word on both accounts.
Yes, some of the characters are familiar from the first “City”, although, there’s the hoodlum, Marv (Mickey Rourke), who, if memory serves, ended his life in the electric chair, and now, as if nothing happened, he just manages – in the role of something like a people’s guard – to snatch out of thin air, knives, and all sorts of hatchets, and nooses.
But the newcomers simply push the old fellows aside with their elbows, as if they were breaking into the city from some other film, the meaning and story of which the audience is asked not to worry about.
Now, there’s the story, shamelessly interrupted by the authors at the most interesting moment, of the extra lucky gambler, Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
There’s the story of the salaciously-frigid Ava Lord (Eva Green) and Dwight (Josh Brolin), who takes revenge on her for some reason.
But this confusion, in which, let’s say, Dwight can’t be differentiated by sight from Johnny – moreover since their faces, as with the other body parts of the characters, are demolished with relentless regularity – is not a big deal or even a little bit of a problem.
These aren’t real people, of course we understand that these are archetypes of the noir genre: a fatalistic bitch, an overconfident gambler, a detective who falls into a sex “honey trap”, and a corrupt parasitic senator.
But when an archetype waltzes with an archetype and gets kicked out by an archetype, then it’s not really a film anymore, but almost like an abstract painting.
And it’s simply ridiculous to ask an abstract painting questions about the logic of its subject matter.
By the same token, even in this hectic world, there are some things that remain constant.
The fighting prostitutes from the first “City” still hold a security perimeter around their native slums, against the besieging forces of darkness.
And, while at first, the ghost of Detective Hartigan isn’t anywhere to be seen, he later joins the party, and it’s always nice to look at Bruce Willis.
The major problem with Sin City 2 has to do with something else.
Frank Miller was great in that, as an illustrator, he skilfully fused comics with noir fiction, and, as a director, in how he reinvented our understanding of how to take comics from the page to the screen.
Comics and noir fiction are two diametrically opposed “realities”.
The comics phenomenon, in its modern context, was born at the end of the 1920s, when Dashiell Hammett’s novels, Red Harvest (1929), The Maltese Falcon (1930), and The Glass Key (1931), created the noir cannon, which at that time was called the hard-boiled school.
Or pulp fiction.
Comics have given Hollywood many dozens of characters: from Popeye the Sailor Man – who ate spinach to give himself heroic strength – Superman, Batman, and the gumshoe, Dick Tracy, to the Hulk, Thor, Spiderman, and other such “avengers”.
But there was always something lacking in every film based on a comic: the illustrated characters stubbornly refused to come to life on the screen, and continued to be imposters in the like it or not “real” world that surrounded them.
Simply put, they were totally devoid of “existence”.
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre in world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel, with its dilemmas, characters, family scandals, and historical background, lost all persuasiveness.
What Forsytes, what Thibaults, or Rougon-Macquarts, or even Bolkonskys or Rostovs are even conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz, or Hiroshima?
That type of novel could easily be twisted into a soap opera, but the crime novel – by definition on the margins – rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett learned first-hand what it was like to work as an orderly on the front.
He was a communist.
Incidentally, other pillars of the genre, such as writers, Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, and directors, Jules Dassin, Joseph Losey, and Edward Dmytryk, were also close to the Communist Party, albeit to a lesser extent.
This is why noir, and the archetype that they created, is, first of all, crude and cynical, and, secondly, particularly social.
It’s almost like an American version of socialist realism.
The first Sin City was remarkable because it counterintuitively, yet organically, blended comics with noir.
It was the very first time comics came to life on the screen, not a bit ashamed of their illustrational nature, and without pretending to be a “real” film.
The gloom of the corrupt world, where a cardinal orders a hit, and a senator covers for his monstrous sadistic son, was entirely worthy of Hammett’s pen.
While the picturesque details, such as the severed heads that the sadist used to decorate his flat, are as if from the pen of the genius, James Ellroy, author of The Black Dahlia, and the best – that is to say, declaratively stomach-turning – representative of the neo-noir genre.
Sin City 2 is not just a retreat, but an utter capitulation of the radical Miller-Rodriguez stylistic addition to the comic tradition.
Probably, much of this is the result of 3D technology.
When you’re watching the second Sin City, you feel as if you are imprisoned in a glass sphere, inside of which snow covers a toy-sized cesspool.
However, more often than not, it’s not snow at all, but bloody scraps, however, in the grand scheme of things, what’s the difference?
There is nothing to be said about sociality here.
After all, such a thing is only possible when somewhere, in some place, we, at some time or another, have, even if it’s along the margins of a dirty swamp, a normal world that exists, to which a girl, who has been down a crooked path, can return, or, let’s say, where it’s possible to tell her devastated parents that the one who destroyed her has been punished.
When there is no room in sin city for anything other than sin, then sin is no longer a sin, but just the norm.
It's boring, just like any other norm.
The chaos of Sin City 2 is just boring.
To be fair, the domestic release added a little extra spice to this unsavoury sin.
The on-screen captions warn that the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the show, which in its least bloody scene shows a person’s fingers being broken with pliers, this reads as hellish humour.
Hammett would have liked it.
