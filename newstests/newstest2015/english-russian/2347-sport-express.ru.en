Member of the State Duma Committee for Physical Culture, Sport, and Youth Affairs and former world champion, Nikolai Valuev, has proposed offering bonuses, upon entering an institute of higher learning, for achieving “Ready for Labour and Defence” (GTO) standards.
According to him, the targets will be generally the same as they were during Soviet times: individuals will have to pass a qualifying standard in pull-ups, running, and other exercises.
To recall, 12 Russian territorial subjects will start to introduce GTO standards in their regions starting on September 1.
I also proposed offering schoolchildren, who passed GTO, bonuses upon entering an institute of higher education, Valuev noted.
For example, a few points could be added to their Unified State Exam.
There is also a proposal to offer extra vacation days to those in the workforce who complete the same sports examination.
