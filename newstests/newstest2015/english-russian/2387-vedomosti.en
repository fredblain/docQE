The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate growth of the electric vehicle market
This week the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce a plan to the government for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, Deputy Director of a Department at the Ministry, Oleg Pluzhnikov, said at a roundtable organized by Vedomosti at a Moscow car dealership in 2014.
The plan was drafted by order of the government and one of its main goals is reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September or the beginning of October, Pluzhnikov says, the proposed measures deal with electric vehicles and hybrids – a development plan for transport vehicles that use natural gas motor fuel already exists in Russia.
The plan (Vedomosti has a copy) is intended for 2014-2017.
The development of assessment criteria for electric and hybrid transport vehicles and a decision on how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly transport vehicles still lies ahead.
The report to the government, which will include tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; a plan for preferential financing and preferential leasing will emerge by April 2015; and proposals on price reductions for cars, stimulus for localization, and the creation of service infrastructure will be prepared by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is expected that changes to laws and regulation will be introduced to simplify conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, at gas stations, and so on).
Moreover, federal civil servants intend, over the course of 2015, to formulate proposals for regional authorities, so that they can also stimulate the use of environmentally friendly transport – in terms of providing such types of transport with preferential treatment on the roads and for parking; and by February 2016, proposals on the expansion of state procurements of this type of transport.
Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development, already by October 2014, will introduce a list of criteria to assess the activities of regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of environmentally friendly transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The electric vehicle market in Russia is only just developing – in 2013, around 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the entire country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty on electric vehicles was reduced to zero, and, as such, sales will amount to approximately 500 units, predicts Chief Executive Officer for Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But even a fivefold increase won’t make electric vehicles anymore noticeable: according to data from the Association of European Business, 2.78 mln. light motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia in 2013.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles into Russia.
Renault is preparing to start imports – the company is focusing primarily on corporate clients, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships for Renault in Russia, Nikolai Remiz.
The majority of other producers of electric vehicles have taken a wait-and-see position as concerns Russia.
Even Russian producers have developed electric vehicles – GAZ – but output is pitiful.
For example, according to ASM Holding’s data, between January and July, 2014, AvtoVAZ produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low because of the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the Director for Engineering at AvtoVAZ, Sergei Amanov, without state support there will be no breakthrough in this segment….
Development of the Russian market of electric vehicles, in addition to the high cost of the cars (the electric vehicles that are sold in Russia are, on average, twice as expensive as their counterparts with internal combustion engines), is being constrained by the underdevelopment of charging infrastructure (charging stations are few and far between), sighs General Director of Avtostat, Sergei Tselikov.
Owing to the high cost and slow rate at which production costs are declining, electric vehicles will remain a niche segment over the next 3-4 years, forecasts the Editor-in Chief of AvtoReview, Mikhail Podorozhansky, and Tselikov agrees with him.
Auto producers, on the other hand, say that certain models of electric automobiles are already close in price to regular ones.
The Russian market for electric vehicles has good prospects, the most important thing is to instil confidence in consumers that the electric vehicle is a reality; this will in part be accomplished by the appearance of all the new charging stations, emphasizes the President of BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are already being implemented, for example, by state company Rosseti: in Moscow several stations have already been built, and soon there will be another 80 or so.
Negotiations on the construction of a network of charging stations are currently underway in other regions.
According to the Director of a Department at Rosseti, Vladimir Sofin, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build charging stations throughout the country, but there are some problems: the small amount of electric automobiles in the country and the absence of a universal charging standard for all brands of electric vehicles.
Moreover, as a distribution company, Rosseti doesn’t have the right to sell electricity, and the possibility of doing so in terms of charging electric vehicles is still being worked out.
Pankov believes that the most effective state measure to support the development of an electric vehicle market in Russia is the removal of customs duties.
The zero duty rate will be in place until the end of 2014, and the possibility of its extension, as well as an extension of the subsidy list, are being worked out.
The replacement of the transport tax with an environmental one (the idea is being discussed and would concern all vehicles) will also support the market, but not as substantially as customs preferences, Pankov reckons.
The transport tax in Russia isn’t very high, says Pankov, in contrast with Norway, for example, where a lowering of the tax resulted in rapid growth in the sales of electric vehicles – they now account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, stimulus measures are also needed for automobile owners; for example, free parking in the centre of the city (as has already been done in Moscow), Pankov is certain, or the ability of electric automobiles to travel in a specially-designated lane, which is something Russia still doesn’t have.
