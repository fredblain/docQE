The situation outside of Ilovaisk is extremely complicated.
Until the operation to withdraw troops from the area of encirclement is completed, I won’t be able to speak in greater detail.
Once the operation is completed, information about losses and the reasons for the current situation will be made available.
Those who are guilty of creating this situation will be held to account”, Mr. Lysenko added, while refusing to discuss in greater detail the situation outside of Ilovaisk, where several Ukrainian battalions became encircled.
