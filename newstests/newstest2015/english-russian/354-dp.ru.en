No one told you that the mussels would be better in a salad, I didn’t promise you that, joked the waitress from the new Palm brasserie.
It must be formally recognized that this is indeed the case, but the mind and the stomach remain adamant.
After all, everyone knows that when we say “Belgium”, we mean mussels, and when we say “mussels”, we mean “Belgium”.
Restaurants love to sagaciously proclaim that the success of an establishment is dependent on three factors: location, location, and, once again, location.
There are certain places that are not just well, but rather superbly located, and yet they are still unlucky.
In a word, having sat down at a table at Palm, I remembered how, some time ago, this used to be the site of a café called Gorodok (in tribute to the television show of the same name), then there was Odessa Mama, as well as the restaurant, Beaujolis, and the Druzhba beer hall.
Now there is another beer hall here, but this time it’s not a nostalgic soviet-style one, but Belgian.
Above ground is just the tip of the iceberg – a bar counter and a few tables – the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But still, it is pleasant here, like a child’s bedroom: red, yellow, and green walls, different coloured chairs, and, in place of a window, a television that shows mermaids swimming.
Belgian establishments are far from new in Saint Petersburg, so there is something to compare this one to.
There are eight types of beers on tap here (260-300 roubles for 0.5L) and countless numbers of bottled ones (170-1550 roubles).
A sociable and friendly waitress happily presents me with a menu, while telling me that “mussels are large filling seeds”, and here it should be noted that the service, in spite of other shortcomings, is the best feature of Palm.
The menu contains what one might expect, but the preparation of the dishes is often rather unexpected.
For example, who would be able to predict that the Meat Roll with Walloon plums (280 roubles) was actually a carpaccio, that, moreover, was so thinly sliced that parchment paper would seem to be an outrageously thick material in comparison.
The only way to be able to detect some sort of flavour would be to shove half the plate into your mouth all at once.
The salads are even worse.
It would be fair to call the Classic Salade Liegeoise (260) a crime against the Belgian people: some sort of withered-up iceberg lettuce, potato that was boiled some very long while ago, soggy Kenyan beans, overly hard pieces of bacon, plus, for some reason, pickled onion.
You wouldn’t wish this salade liegeoise on your worst enemy!
The list of ingredients for the Belgian Salad was a bit different, but the impression it made was no more positive.
If it was possible to turn a blind eye to the unripened quartered cherry tomatoes and over-fried mushrooms, it was impossible to ignore the mussels that looked as if they had been boiled and refrozen several times during their lifetime!
After all, I already know that absolutely normal White Sea mussels are available here!
They are served in small pots “with your choice of sauce” (490-560 for 0.5 kg).
Out of half a dozen sauces, the one made with white wine, celery, and carrots honestly wasn’t a success.
There were vegetables in the sauce, but no aroma, and whether or not there actually was any wine in the sauce remains a mystery.
On the plus side, the frites with homemade mayonnaise served alongside the mussels were good.
The Chicken Waterzooi served here is not a broth, but so thick that, depending on your mood, you might decide you have either a first or a main course in front of you – it’s simply a nice creamy soup.
It was stated that the local chef prepares the rabbit in a beer sauce, but nothing was said about rosemary.
In fact, the situation turned out to be the diametric opposite: the rosemary took over the whole dish.
I was given the impression that this rabbit was exclusively fed rosemary bushes throughout its life, and, as a result, its meat had taken on a highly unusual aroma.
But, at the same time, the rabbit leg was served with a wonderful – no, utterly outstanding – pear in a caramelized crust.
Palm offers not only sweet, but also savoury waffles with beef, chicken, or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple syrup turned out to be too runny and the waffles were a bit dry.
However, the manager came up to my table and rather casually asked about my impressions of the meal.
That means it’s worth coming in another time.
