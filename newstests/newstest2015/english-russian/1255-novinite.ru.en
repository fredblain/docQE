In total, three of the four bosses of the Agriculture Fund had already been replaced by Friday.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria only officially reported the removal of Acting Director, Atanas Dobrev, from his position.
Lozan Vasilev filled his position.
It emerged that two of the three deputy acting directors of the Fund were quietly replaced on Friday.
Deputy Acting Director, Tatiana Angelova, who up until that time was responsible for government assistance and the SAPARD programme, was relieved of her duties, reports BGNES with reference to Trud newspaper.
I was not a part of the Fund’s Board of Directors, because, according to the law, we are not senior executives, but I was later informed that I had been relieved of my duties.
I can’t say why, nothing is mentioned about my dismissal on the Fund’s website.
I am currently on vacation.
I hope that I can find out more on Monday", Angelova told the publication.
Her position will be filled by Ivanka Bagdatova, who previously was the Head of the Investment Loans Unit at the central fund of the Agriculture Fund in Sofia.
Deputy Acting Director, Nikolai Dachev, was also relieved of his duties.
Up until the present, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields that were paid for by the EU.
His post will be filled by Zhivko Zhivkov, who was Head of the Regional Directorate of the Agriculture Fund in the city of Veliko-Tarnovo until January 2014.
Only Deputy Head of the Fund, Atidzhe Alieva-Veli, retained her position.
She is currently responsible for the Development of Rural Districts Programme.
The official reasons for all of the changes to the agency have not been announced.
