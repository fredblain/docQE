Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the box office
Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 3 has made back less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while Sin City: A Dame to Kill For has made back only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The Cameron Diaz vehicle Sex Tape took only $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films such as How To Train Your Dragon 2 are also showing disappointing box office returns.
An article from Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that, when it comes to children's movies, the poor quality of the films themselves might be to blame.
Collin called 2014 the "the worst" year yet for children's films, and described How To Train Your Dragon 2 as a merely "functional" fantasy sequel.
But when it comes to film pitched at a slightly older market, it appears that the issue might not necessarily lie with the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for every summer release playing on at least 2,000 screens between May's Memorial Day holiday and July 20, for 2013 and for this year.
The results, which take the opinion of both cinema audiences and film critics into account, suggest that this year's crop of films are of similar calibre last year's hits.
Some commentators have suggested that changing viewing habits and the increased popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's forthcoming Jungle Book film, told the website Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."
We have to acknowledge that and not try to chase what used to be.
In contrast to Hollywood's current box office slump, Netflix recently saw revenue from its streaming content service reach $1.2bn, almost doubling last year's figure of $837m.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and predicted a Hollywood "meltdown."
In light of the current downturn, some commentators are arguing that his dire prophecy may have held some truth to it.
With summer 2015 set to usher in a slate of potential big box office hits, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other figures within the film industry are feeling more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the drop in box office takings as simply "cyclical," telling Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest box-office summer in history, and nobody will be worrying about the business."
