Chelsea midfielder, Marco van Ginkel, will spend the upcoming season on loan to Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21 year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the next few hours to undergo a medical examination.
Last season he only walked out onto the pitch as a part of the London club three times.
To recall, Milan previously leased striker, Fernando Torres, from Liverpool.
