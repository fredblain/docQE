Lost mushroom picker is found in Elninsky woods after five days.
The elderly man turned out to be alive even though he had spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without provisions.
The poor mushroom picker was found thanks to the joint efforts of rescue workers and volunteers.
Aleksandr Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from Tambov region spent five days in the woods."
Without food or water.
Relatives, rescue workers, and volunteers were searching for him.
There were even cynologists with dogs, but to no avail.
The man was only found after a helicopter joined the search efforts.
On that day, Vitaly Aleksandrovich went out into the woods, as per usual, to collect honey fungus and birch boletus mushrooms, but he hadn't returned by the evening.
Relatives immediately called for help and, already on the next day, rescue workers and concerned residents from the neighbouring village started searching: there were approximately 30 people in total.
On the fifth day, a helicopter from the fire-rescue centre joined them.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue group section of the Smolensk Region Fire and Rescue Centre, said: "The helicopter was brought in and the man was found".
He had walked very far away, into a totally different area.
It was around 12 km from the search area.
He travelled a huge distance for his age.
It's a miracle he's still alive.
The mushroom picker was admitted to Elninsky Central District Hospital unconscious and in critical condition.
Paramedics diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as with severe dehydration and hypothermia.
Doctors can't fathom how the elderly man could still be alive after spending five days in the woods.
Valentina Nepsha, Head of the medical ward at Elninsky Central District Hospital: "An examination of the patient has been completed and treatment has been determined".
Intravenous and antibacterial treatments.
While taking into account all of his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, and it remains critical, but with positive tendencies.
The pensioner, Vitaly Aleksandrovich, comes to Smolenshchina from Tambov region every year.
His grandson says that his grandfather had gone collecting mushrooms before, but he had never gone deep into the woods.
Aleksei Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom picker, shared the following: "The woods aren't far from the road; he's not really a local himself."
He's just been coming to visit for a few years now, to visit relatives.
And well, he went out to collect mushrooms.
Obviously, he went a little too far and got lost.
With the beginning of mushroom-picking season, people frequently get lost in all districts of Smolensk region.
Over just the past several days, there have been five similar cases.
Rescue workers offer this reminder: you must go out into the woods in bright clothing, with a small supply of food, matches, and a compass.
Furthermore, it's advisable to leave a trail behind you, so that later on it's possible to find your way back.
