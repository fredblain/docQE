Washington responds to Russia's military activity with a phone call.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow is providing to President Assad is only leading to an escalation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House isn't yet ready to talk about this with his Russian counterpart, writes PJ media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov in order to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
The publication PJ media reports on this.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that continued support of President Assad by Russia creates a risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, and also negatively impacts our common goal - combatting extremism - if we do not remain focused on finding ways to solve the Syrian conflict via a direct transfer of power", stated representatives of the US State Department.
They also noted that Kerry, once again, stressed the US's commitment to the fight against Islamic State within the framework of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of it.
Furthermore, the US "would welcome a constructive role for Russia in efforts to confront Islamic State".
Last Friday, White House officials stated that they weren't entirely sure what types of military actions Russian forces are undertaking in Syria; however, Washington intends to discuss this issue with Moscow.
Nevertheless, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet come: "When the President decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, that is when he will pick up the phone and try to make that call".
Barack Obama himself believes that Russia's decision the increase support for the Assad regime is "a losing bet".
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake, that continued support of Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he didn't heed my warnings, and the result is that the situation has gotten worse", the US President stated.
