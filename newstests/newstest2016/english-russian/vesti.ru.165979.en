The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret in relation to the closure of the American Centre, which operated out of the Library of Foreign Literature.
The Centre operated in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the US Embassy's American Centre at the M.I. Rudomino All-Russian State Library in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation as of late call into question the commitment of the Russian government to the relationship between the Russian and American peoples, which was maintained even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries", reads a statement by US Ambassador John Tefft received by Interfax.
The American Centre created deep and strong ties between the people and the cultures of Russia and the United States.
It was a centre of American culture, history, and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with many notable American figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, academics, politicians, and writers.
"Just last year, the American Centre held more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50 thousand Russian visitors", the diplomat underscored.
Tefft recalled that, about a year ago, a decision was made to close another joint Russian-American project: The FLEX educational exchange programme (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
