The second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
From September 17-18, the second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, in which the Tyumen delegation, headed by the governor, will take part.
The Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen, Vladimir Shuglya, who is included in the official delegation, spoke about the upcoming event and the interim results of cooperation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what objectives does the Sochi forum set?
This major event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is built on the effective cooperation of the regions, and important links between the two states.
It's planned that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, will attend the plenary session.
During the plenary and breakout sessions, the conversation will be about the experiences of regional and municipal authorities in Russia and Belarus with the implementation of industrial policy, the regulatory and statutory framework, and the programmes of the Union State.
The Governor of Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I think that this is evidence of the successful and sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be attended by representatives from relevant ministries and agencies, as well as by Russian and Belarusian businesspeople.
There will also be trade shows and specialised exhibitions, including those from Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help us sign profitable new contracts and agreements.
I'll add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk in June of last year.
More that two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, took part in the event.
At that time, a very important cooperation agreement was signed between Tyumen and Minsk regions.
The significance of the work we have accomplished is evidenced by the fact that a meeting of the standing seminar of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
Furthermore, a delegation from Tyumen region's agricultural sector visited the Republic of Belarus in order to study the experience of Belarusians with training staff in agriculture, identify additional areas of mutual interest, and organise new investment projects in the agricultural sector.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What issues did you discuss?
During the meeting with the Governor of Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakushev, the conversation was about cooperation between the region and the Republic of Belarus in today's challenging environment.
The issue of supplying Belarusian agricultural equipment and using financial mechanisms - they are needed to reduce the cost of machinery for the end-consumer - were also touched on.
Issues associated with the work of the Tyumen trading house, Belshina, and options for loss prevention, were discussed.
These are important issues, since investment projects need to work well and generate profit for the region.
The continued delivery of JSC MAZ passenger trucks and development of the JSC MAZ service centre, which was established in Tyumen at the JSC TPATP facility, were also talked about.
The conversation also concerned preparations for the visit of a working group from the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of the current year.
Another topic of discussion was the completion of negotiations and the signing of an agreement on trade-economic, scientific-technological, and cultural cooperation between Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
As such, the dynamic of our mutual relationship promises to reach a new level.
These issues also concerned the regional centre.
During the meeting with the Head of the Administration of Tyumen city, Aleksandr Moor, we talked about upgrading the Tyumen bus fleet.
Approximately 100 buses are already "at death's door", and, as such, a new set of vehicles from Belarus is needed, which will operate on clean gas fuel.
Yet another aspect: the Tyumen elevator factory is working with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products, JSC Mogilevliftmash, by procuring components from them.
In my opinion, these activities could become even more developed, given the programme to install new elevators in the regional centre.
I'll add that a meeting was held with the Governor of Kurgansk region, as part of the expanded powers of the consul, during which the issue of increasing the turnover of trade and the delivery of modern Belarusian equipment to the Trans-Ural region was discussed.
A meeting with the Governor of Omsk region is planned for the end of September.
The expanded consular district contains five federal subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called the original headquarters of the district.
The region is a testing ground for the launch of many promising projects, including the work of the honorary consul general.
On the whole, these types of meetings are important and worthwhile because they make it possible to directly and quickly resolve many issues, while removing their contentiousness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current environment, it's critically important to not undermine groundwork while continuing to develop future possibilities.
