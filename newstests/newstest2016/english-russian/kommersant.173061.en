Kiev breaks up the atomic union.
Kiev has officially filed a renouncement of Ukraine's cooperation with Russia to complete the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovnaya Rada, during a second attempt, ultimately voted for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements to complete the third and fourth blocks were signed back in 2010-2012, but the launch of the project never happened.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovnaya Rada of Ukraine adopted a law terminating the agreement concluded with the Russian Federation between 2010-2012 to construct the third and fourth blocks of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The country's government only succeeded in introducing the bill after the second vote; during the first round it was supported by 210, while a minimum of 226 were needed, but after the revote, 234 members of parliament voted for the draft.
According to the original plans, the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant, which was initiated during the Soviet period, was to consist of four 1 GW power units with pressurised water reactors, but only two were ever built.
Negotiations with Moscow on completing construction led to the signing of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010; while between 2011-2012, the Rada adopted the relevant legislation.
Since funds from Ukraine's budget weren't available, it was assumed that the block would be constructed using loans provided by the Russian side, but funds were never allocated.
After the revolution in Kiev in February 2014 and the resulting cooling of relations between the two countries, Kiev began to phase-out dealings with Moscow in the nuclear sector, announcing the refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant and on a project to construct a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations have been preserved is for the purchase of fuel from Russia for already-operating Ukrainian nuclear power plants (which provided approximately half of the country's power production), since Ukraine's National Atomic Energy Generating Company, Enorgatom, has nothing to replace Russian supplies with yet.
Plans to complete construction of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant in Ukraine with different contractors haven't been definitively scrapped yet: as early as in 2014, an announcement was made in Kiev about negotiations with the Czech company Skoda JS.
