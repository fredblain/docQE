A man pours blood on several Dali paintings at an exhibit in Riga.
A visitor to a Latvian Artists Union's exhibit in Riga broke windows in the museum and damaged Salvador Dali's "Vision of an Angel" sculpture.
Currently, the museum is holding an exhibit of works by Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
The man, who was born in 1985, entered the sculpture hall at 14:20.
He immediately began to act inappropriately: he damaged a sculpture and broke windows.
Then, he started to move about the premises and stained some of the works from the permanent exhibit with blood.
Among them was a portrait of Poruk painted by Miervaldis Polis.
According to the President of the Latvian Artists Union, Igor Dobychin, as quoted by Interfax, display cases were also damaged.
The police and art experts are working at the scene of the crime.
The latter are determining the extent of the physical and monetary damages.
Criminal charges of disorderly conduct have been filed against the man.
The exhibit of Picasso's and Dali's works at the Latvian Artists Union, where more than 200 original works by the artists are being presented, runs from August 4 through to September 27.
