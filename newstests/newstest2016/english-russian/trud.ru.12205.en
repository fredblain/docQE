The reckless driver who hit a biker on Kutuzovsky gets 2 years in prison.
Furthermore, the court partially granted the complainants' civil claims against Deni Mirzoev in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
Moscow's Dorogomilovsky Court has sentenced Deni Mirzoev who hit and killed a motorcyclist on Kutuzovsky Prospect in Moscow.
According to Russian News Service reports, Mirzoev received a sentence of two years imprisonment in a penal colony settlement.
He was found guilty under the article "Violation of the rules for traffic safety and the operation of transport vehicles" of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
Furthermore, the court partially granted the complainants' civil claims in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
During the presentation of cases, the prosecutor asked that Mirzoev be sentenced to three years imprisonment and requested that he pay the full amount of the complainants' claims: eight million roubles.
The accident in question happened on May 22 at around three o'clock in the morning, near building No. 30 on Kutuzovsky Prospect.
Mirzoev was behind the wheel of a BMW vehicle that crossed into the oncoming lane of traffic and hit a motorcyclist standing on the side of the road.
The man, who was born in 1989, died from his injuries at the scene of the accident.
Friends of the deceased reported on social media that the driver of the BMW was travelling at high speed and crossed into oncoming traffic before the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to evade responsibility, bikers organised a motorcycle ride from Sparrow Hills to the City Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs at 38 Petrovka.
Shortly thereafter, it became known that, following the results of the interrogation, the individual suspected of being responsible for the accident was detained.
