UN Secretary-General is against using military force to resolve the Syrian conflict.
During a press conference, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution", AP quotes him as replying to a question concerning military support of Syria by Russia.
Ban Ki-moon also stated that a meeting would be held with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council about the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the foreign ministries of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be about Syria", he announced.
Earlier today, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, reported that the General Staff has not ruled out the possibility of establishing an air force base in Syria in the future.
Right now, there are no such plans.
"But anything could happen", said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier Kommersant reported that the US doesn't trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus is essential to the fight against the terrorist group, Islamic State, which is banned in the Russian Federation.
