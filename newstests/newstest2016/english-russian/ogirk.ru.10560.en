Sayansk plans to establish a 900-job facility.
Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as a chemical industry centre and has well-developed infrastructure requiring systemic support.
A year ago, a new mayor, Oleg Borovsky, took over leadership of Sayansk.
He spoke with a correspondent from Oblastnaya about the results of the first year of work, new projects, and future possibilities.
Oleg Valeryevich, how did you begin your work as mayor?
First of all, I familiarised myself with the results of the audit of financial and economic activities, and I initiated an independent audit of municipal budget expenditures.
Next, a review of municipal assets was conducted.
One of the first practical steps was cutting the turnover time for documentation down to five days.
Previously, documents could take months to get through the proper channels.
Initiatives to increase the revenue base and optimise spending were developed.
Last year, in November, an on-site government meeting was held in Sayansk where issues concerning the socioeconomic development of the territory were discussed.
The city didn't have design and estimation documentation (DED) for even a single asset.
Without this, Sayansk couldn't participate in federal programmes.
We started with DEDs for the roads, childcare facilities, and the northern sewage and water line.
Right now, roadwork is already underway in two areas.
How is the RF Presidential Decree on the construction of childcare facilities being applied in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
The city hasn't seen positive demographic indicators like this for the past 27 years.
As such, ensuring spaces in childcare facilities is one of the most relevant issues.
Since September 1, childcare facility No. 10 has been closed for capital repairs designed to create 320 spaces.
The estimated cost of the renovation is 86 mln roubles.
Before now, the city had never received such funds.
Last year, following renovations, childcare facility No.23 was opened and is now attended by 200 children.
The renovation was carried out via co-financing from the regional and municipal budgets and cost more than 67 mln roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and assistance from the regional government, the money to purchase furniture and equipment was found, and the People's Initiative also helped out with this.
There are plans to start building a new childcare facility in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the waitlist for children from 18 months to three years.
We don't have waitlists for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors expressing interest in the area?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be carried out, first and foremost, by Sayansk businesses: we need to provide jobs specifically for them.
In October, a 60-apartment building will be opened for orphaned children in Leningradsky microdistrict.
As far as construction is concerned, I will add that Sayansk is one of four cities in Irkutsk region that has been included in a programme to build economy-class housing.
All the required documentation has been prepared.
Construction of a 90-block section will commence soon.
Altogether we have announced the construction of 10 thousand square metres of housing, and there are many wanting to participate in the programme.
One of the requirements is that the housing must not cost more than 30 thousand roubles per square metre, and that it should be a "turnkey" property at this price.
If we can handle the specified scope, then we will continue to participate in the programme.
As far as investors are concerned, we also have other interesting projects.
Back in the day, a pig farm was built in Sayansk that was sold, in 2004, for a pittance.
We are working with the prosecutor's office to protest this transaction.
Especially since the land underneath the facility is federal property.
We are working with Moscow to resolve the issue of a transfer of 88 hectares of property to the region, and the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is ready to put 1.5 bln roubles into the redevelopment and launch of the project.
We will gain 900 jobs with the launch of the pig farm, which will be a big help to the city.
Is the institute of social partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have concluded approximately 140 socio-economic partnership agreements.
The implementation of many projects was made possible thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Tangible support has been provided by enterprises such as: CJSC Vostok-Tsentr, Novo-Ziminskaya Thermal Power Plant, LLC Sayanski Broiler, and LLC PC MDF; the management of these enterprises responds to all of our requests.
Right before City Day, LLC Sayanski Broiler presented the city with a playground, and the company, Vostok-Tsentr, carried out a renovation of an equestrian yard, where specialists work with children using hippotherapy, spending more than 1 mln roubles on it.
Thanks to funds donated by sponsors, we managed to make improvements to the grounds of the city's civil registry office.
The sponsors helped us to vibrantly celebrate City Day.
As in the good old days, a parade, featuring the city's collectives and organisations, was held.
We released a city chronicle and a book of Sayansk's poets.
The first builders and people who have made a significant contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded with commemorative medals.
Patrons also participate in the work of the city's charitable foundation.
The first step was the purchase of musical instruments for talented young musicians.
In nine months, more than 800 thousand roubles have been allocated to support these talented kids, to help children who require expensive treatments, and to support children from low-income families.
How are staffing issues in the social services sector dealt with in Sayansk?
The city doesn't have enough doctors or subject teachers.
Providing specialists with housing is critically important to solving the staffing issue.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments to doctors, and four teachers have received service housing.
We have a programme for the allocation of housing with the option to privatise it after five years.
There are plans to reconfigure a building, in which another eight apartments for teachers will be built.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the programme "Housing for Russian Families".
Over the longer term, we will construct housing for public sector employees.
Most importantly, our city has a hard-working team with which I am able to solve the most complex issues.
It's critical to draw the right conclusions from each crisis, and life goes on.
The potential of Sayansk and of our region is great.
