Internet sales increased at slowest ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
First three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
Last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
Online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
Experts believe November's Black Friday could be holding back spending
For over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain's high streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with just a five per cent rise on last year.

'If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000, it was always going to rationalise over time,' Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now that is plateauing a bit, you might see (growth) fall away.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales.
Experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November .
Last year five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to snap up deals crashing a number of retailers websites.

Research published by the British Retail Consortium found just over £1 in every £5 was being spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online, rather than using high street fashion chains.
