Otar Kushanashvili
Well I'm not so na√Øve as to have been stunned by the reaction to the interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are pissed-off, I get it; there's nothing they like better than giving the enemy the boot.
And even though I didn't wrap myself in the flag, I've said the same thing, the exact same thing a million times here: I never directly called anyone a bastard - something else bothered me.
All of my pseudo-friends, in an instant, in a second, vanished somewhere.
The pressure that I have been dealing with is so strong that even a person like me, who has been around the block more than a few times, thinks that people have gone crazy.
It's as if you're walking along by yourself and a mob just starts attacking you and, well, beating you with sticks.
But you have to know me, I'm no pushover, if they come at me with their fists, I will strike back with a howitzer; I'm a veteran, guys, be afraid.
The total lack of support is a whole other matter.
I didn't really have any illusions, but now...
My best quality has always been self-sufficiency, so just try me.
But only idiots could give passports to degenerates like Fred Durst or Monson.
It would have been better to give it to me, the best journalist, someone from an honourable profession.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili didn't mince words when describing events in Crimea:
What they did with the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
This is what they call an annexation.
I assume that the reference to how a tipsy Khrushchev attempted to sign something by no means fits into the overall picture of human society.
It's like visiting your neighbour and taking away his home...
The war started with the Kremlin, and it will only come to an end there.
I am almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, it started with a phone call from some bastard within the confines of the Kremlin.
I have a hunch who it might have been...
Kobzon doesn't have all that much longer to live.
I don't understand, he's a great artist, why does he need to lick Putin's boots.
Is he losing his apartment or something?
So, they took down his statue.
For sure, after all, people remember him as someone who insulted his small motherland.
But now, reconciliation depends entirely on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
