A bill on the indexation of social pensions in relation to rising prices has been introduced in the Duma.
A bill has been introduced in the State Duma that makes provisions for the annual indexation of social pensions, in relation to rising prices, starting on February 1.
The document's author, a deputy from A Just Russia, Aleksandr Lomakin-Rumyantsev, also suggests carrying out an additional indexation on April 1, if the growth rate of the minimum living wage exceeds the rate of price increases on goods and services.
Under the current law, the indexation of social pensions takes place annually on April 1, in relation to the growth rate of the minimum living wage of pensioners in the Russian Federation over the previous year.
The draft law, introduced in the lower house, makes provisions for the introduction of indexing social pensions in relation to the growth of consumer prices.
In this case, the first indexation would be moved to February 1, while the second would be held on April 1.
