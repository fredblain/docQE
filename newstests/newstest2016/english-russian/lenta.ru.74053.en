Borodai dubs the US newspaper's information as libel against Strelkov.
Former head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Aleksandr Borodai, has denied information that was published in the US newspaper, The Washington Post.
He spoke about this in a telephone interview with a correspondent from Lenta.ru.
The article in The Washington Post is wonderful in that everything is entirely misquoted.
Of course, no one tied up Igor Strelkov, the former Minister of Defence for the DPR, and he 'left' the territory of the Donbass Republic in entirely high spirits, without any ropes and without the three truckloads of money that are being ascribed to him by various people", he noted.
According to Borodai, there definitely was talk about Strelkov during the conversation with the reporter from the US newspaper.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov needed to be immediately removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic", said the former head of government for the DPR.
Borodai stressed that he didn't know why the reporter from the US publication decided to write that Strelkov was "tied up" while being removed to Russian territory.
I suspect that this is a provocation.
If it's not a provocation, then it's a surprising case of miscommunication, since I stressed that Strelkov left on his own", Borodai noted.
"It's libel against me and Strelkov", he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared on the pages of The Washington Post, in which Borodai was quoted as saying that he forcibly removed Strelkov to Russian territory.
According to the publication, Borodai stated that he was forced to tie-up his associate.
