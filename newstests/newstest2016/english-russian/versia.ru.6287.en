Relaxation areas will appear at Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several cemeteries in the capital will be equipped with special areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
The first of them will be Butovskoye, Domodedovskoye, and Shcherbinskoye cemeteries.
The very first area for psychological rest has already appeared at Troyekurovskoye cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar areas will appear in other districts of the city.
Artem Ekimov, who holds the post of head of the state-funded institution (SFI), Ritual, spoke to m24.ru portal about this.
The relaxation areas will look like small green spaces, reminiscent of parks.
According to specialists, cemetery visitors will be able to relax in these "corners", be alone with their thoughts, and gather psychological strength.
Soon, relaxation areas will be built at Domodedovskoye, Butovskoye, and Shcherbinskoye cemeteries, and then in other districts of the capital.
According to the head of the SFI, Ritual, in the event an expansion of the cemetery's area is required, builders will try to preserve existing wooded areas to the greatest extent possible.
Greenery will serve as a living fence that will separate the relaxation areas and the territory just outside that is designated for burial.
SFI Ritual's experts also stated their intention to submit a proposal to ban fences at gravesites.
New cemeteries really could become barrier-free.
Furthermore, SFI Ritual spoke about a readiness to engage in installing electronic terminals that cemetery visitors could use to help figure out the GPS coordinates and plate numbers of gravesites.
In June of this year, SFI Ritual also proposed adjusting the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
So, digging a grave in the summertime will cost one thousand roubles less than in the winter weeks when the ground is frozen.
It bears noting that, over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have increased by an average of 10 percent.
