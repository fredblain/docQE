Luis Enrique: "The match against Roma will be special for me".
Barcelona's Head Coach, Luis Enrique, didn't try to hide that he returned to Rome for the 1st round match in the group stage of the Champions League tournament against Roma with special feelings.
According to the trainer, the face-to-face match between his previous and current teams will be far from ordinary.
To recall, Luis Enrique trained the "wolves" during the 2011-12 season, but wasn't able to put his best foot forward in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome after several years, during which I had gained concrete experience, the UEFA's official website quotes Luis Enrique as saying.
I have nothing but fond memories associated with Rome.
For me, it will be a special game, but that's not all that important.
The most important thing is to start the Champions League with a victory.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the team in the upcoming match.
I'm expecting the type of game from Roma that they played in the Serie A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that understands how to put the pressure on and knows what to do with the ball.
