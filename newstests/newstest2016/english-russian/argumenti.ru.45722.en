Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syria's President Bashar al-Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to address the problem of refugees, then they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The issue is not whether Europe accepts or doesn't accept refugees, but that it is necessary to address the root causes of this problem.
If Europeans are troubled by the fate of refugees, then they should stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the crux of the refugee problem", he said in an RT interview.
We must continue dialogue in the name of reaching a consensus.
However, if we want real success, then this is impossible while people are dying, while the bloodshed continues, and while people don't feel entirely safe.
"So, we can reach a consensus, but we cannot implement anything until we have defeated terrorism in Syria", emphasised Assad.
To recap, around 500 thousand migrants have arrived in the countries of the European Union this year, including those from Syria.
The European Commission stated that the current global migration crisis is the largest since the Second World War.
It cannot be ruled out that thousands of fighters from the extremist group, Islamic State, could be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of the terrorist organisation, which is banned in Russia, could take advantage of the situation in order to establish cells to conduct terrorist activities in the EU.
