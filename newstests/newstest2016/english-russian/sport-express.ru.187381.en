Safarova ends up in the hospital with a viral infection.
Lucie Safarova has been hospitalised with a bacterial infection, AFP reports.
At the moment, the Czech tennis player is in a clinic in Brno.
It's not clear how long the 2015 Roland Garros finalist's recovery will be.
It also bears reminding that, on Monday, Safarova moved up one place in the WTA rankings and is now the world's fifth place female tennis player.
