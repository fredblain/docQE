This year, the Association of Russian Managers' study, "Top 1000 Russian Managers", will be published for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of top Russian managers, the study takes stock of the work of Russian executives for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of winners from last year's rating.
Winners from the previous year are asked to confirm their participation as a candidate in the current year's rating and to nominate members from their own management team.
Moreover, each of those included in the initial list of candidates are invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies whom it would be advisable to add the general pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following heads of functional areas of a company: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, human resources director, IT director, director of public and corporate relations, director of government relations, and director of corporate governance.
Each of the managers proposed by the experts is sent an invitation to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate their management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of candidates by sector is based on the Association of Managers' industry classification: information technology, commercial banking, the forestry and wood processing industry, manufacturing, the media industry, the metal industry, multi-industry holdings, professional services, the communications and data industry, service and consumer goods production, insurance, construction, trade, transportation, the financial sector, pharmaceuticals, the chemical industry, and the energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is given a username and password to log into the site, www.top1000.amr.ru, where they can find information about the other participants and submit their assessments according to the proposed criteria for each functional area.
The methodology for the rating is based on the principle of "the best choosing the best": top managers rating top managers, and functional managers rating functional managers.
Such a principle makes it possible to obtain the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of the expert commission.
All interested candidates of the current year's rating and repeat candidates from previous years' ratings are invited to attend the in-person meetings of the expert commission.
The commission is organised along functional lines: a commission for approving top managers and eight commissions for approving heads of functional departments.
At meetings of the expert commissions, the presented lists are to be approved in alphabetical order (rankings are kept in strict accordance with the internet assessment and remain confidential until the publication of the rating), or updated changes are made to them in accordance with the enclosed list of reserve candidates.
Company names are presented in accordance with Russian language rules and Kommersant standards.
At the time of publication, changes to the status of managers and companies are possible.
