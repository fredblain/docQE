The new Mazda CX-5 and street style.
This is how the word Mazda is written in Japanese characters.
Beautiful, concise, and, at the same time, quite difficult for those who are used to the Cyrillic or Latin alphabets.
Likewise, the new CX-5 crossover, as with any other model by the brand, is attractive without being pretentious on the outside, and technically sound on the inside.
The Japanese, simply by virtue of their "Japaneseness", are capable of turning an attachment to products from the country of the rising sun into a state of total admiration.
You can make as many arguments as you like for cars from other countries, and the person may even agree with these arguments in principle, but the whole conversation will fall apart with the final phrase: "But it's a Japanese car!
There's no point in arguing about it!
Such people, undoubtedly, ought to love not only technology, but also everything else Japanese.
Quote Bash≈ç off the top of their heads, add wasabi to their food, collect katanas, and dress their girlfriends, not in kimonos of course, but according to the edicts of Japanese street style: cute, creative, and totally unexpected.
Take the Japanese school uniform: the only uniform that girls are happy to wear even after graduating from school.
It possesses amazing qualities: at the same time both sensual and strict.
And the older a girl is, the shorter her skirt.
The major change in the look of the CX-5 is the front grill with its five horizontal lines.
But the new shape of the headlights and taillights significantly changes the look of the car, which makes the automobile immediately recognisable in the flow of traffic.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very enticing.
The silhouette is harmonious and the shapes are sensual, but, in spite of this, the appearance has a touch of severity.
There's no need to call the police.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, which is one of the safest cars in the world, you can experience sheer stoic Japanese tranquillity.
The 2.2L diesel engine delivers high torque over a wide range of speeds.
Moreover, the fuel consumption of this 175 horsepower engine is only 5.9L, and it comes exclusively equipped with an automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.
Black boots, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humour to this image, you can pick out some leggings with a police "Do Not Cross" design on them.
Incidentally, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that you don't end up in a car accident when behind the wheel of a CX-5.
To even further enhance comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension of the front and rear shock absorbers was redesigned, and the shape of the front lower control arm bushings was also improved.
The all-wheel drive system has been adapted to Russian conditions.
The road and engine noise levels at high speeds have been reduced by 13%.
A swimsuit in flowers or stripes is just as boring as a budget sedan.
It's another thing entirely when a girl flaunts about in a swimsuit with an original design.
For example, from a roller derby video game.
Then she'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has better designed front and rear seats, which provide optimal extra space for both broad shoulders and long legs - whoever has what.
Moreover, those with long legs will certainly appreciate the fact that the rests at the front part of the centre console are now soft and don't hit your ankles in the curves.
Mazda's most comprehensive package of active safety systems is offered specifically on the CX-5.
Radars, lasers, and cameras are used in order to identify potential threats.
It also includes adaptive lighting, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, and safety breaking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in its class.
Convenient and with minimal obstructions, it can accommodate a cargo volume of 561L. The back seats fold down in a 4:2:4 configuration, with each section having its own remote control lever, which increases the trunk space to 1560L.
In Japan, a cartoon character's costume is called a "kigurumi".
Kigurumi pyjamas look especially cheerful.
You can do anything in them!
Of course you can sleep.
But also, entertain little children.
Or simply stroll along the street as a little beast...
After all, it's wonderful when you have the ability to choose cool clothes, your manner of behaviour, or your car.
