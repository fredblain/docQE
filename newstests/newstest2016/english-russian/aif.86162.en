The Government will decide the fate of pension indexing in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets stated that the government is now looking at approaches to implementing the law on indexing pensions in 2016 to the real rate of inflation, reports Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
She noted that a solution must be found by October 8: by the time the draft budget for next year is introduced in the government.
Furthermore, the Cabinet of Ministers is discussing the possibility of prolonging the decision to freeze the funded pensions of Russian citizens.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings equals 350 billion roubles.
The indexation of pensions in full for next year costs approximately the same amount.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is still no final decision on the matter of who ought to pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person is not working as a result of their own choice, and, at the same time, they do not belong to the socially vulnerable categories of citizens, then it is not entirely fair that society should pay for them.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet of Ministers was considering two options for balancing the state budget.
