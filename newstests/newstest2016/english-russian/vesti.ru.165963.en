A business "game in the airport" takes place at Domodedovo.
A new form of training is being tested in the capital.
Four hundred students tried their hand at being airport staff.
To accomplish this, three airport models were built at Domodedovo.
The young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also maintained the airplanes.
All of this was in the form of a business simulation game, however, in terms of difficulty, it was on par with real life.
Delayed flights, two passengers with broken bones on-board at the same time, and a gangway that got lost somewhere on the way to the airplane.
For a real airport this would be hell.
But for those set up in the hangar at Domodedovo, it was just a standard set of tasks that the rookies needed to address.
Three large airports from different countries of the world were contained in just one hangar.
Four hundred students from colleges and universities in the capital are working inside of it today.
It's an unprecedented chance to learn everything about the inner workings of an airport.
The registration of passengers, maintenance of airplanes, handling of baggage - they were even entrusted with operating the buses on the tarmac, the gangways, and the inspection of passengers.
And passengers are full of problems.
One has an issue with their documents, another missed their flight, and a third filled their bag with suspicious items.
And all of this must be dealt with, as in real life, within the shortest time frame.
For each of these completed tasks, they are given a certain amount of virtual money, as if the airline company were paying them a given amount for servicing the flight.
"For failing to complete given tasks, they were penalised with a fine", explains the game's financial analyst, Dmitry Khilko, in an interview with the programme Vesti-Moskva.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely watching these events.
For them, this test is an effort to try out a new type of training.
They've already found a place for it in a secondary vocational education course.
"Six interregional centres of excellence will be created, which, essentially, will become the new business models for modern colleges, with an up-to-date management system, highly-qualified staff, and the latest equipment", says Natalya Zolotareva, Director of the Department of State Policy in the area of labour force training and continuing professional education at the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation.
Although, the students aren't really concerned about grand plans.
After three days of such training, it looks like they are in need of a day off.
On the plus side, the marks for this exam were expressed in entirely material terms.
The very latest smart glasses, better than anything else I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding in a timely manner to complaints about our airport on Instagram", said a satisfied game participant, PR Manager for the "Frankfurt Airport" team, Sergei Shuvalov.
The judges took note, so to speak, of the very best, in order to offer them jobs at the end of the training.
