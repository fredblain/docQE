Polish authorities initiate a search for a train containing Nazi gold.
Polish loggers have begun cutting down trees over an underground tunnel where, according to some reports, a train containing gold from the Third Reich is located.
Work commenced on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reports.
According to military experts, the forest must be cleared in order to confirm the veracity of rumours about the train containing treasure.
There could be weapons and valuable minerals inside of the train.
On August 31, the Governor for Poland's Lower Silesia Province, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that new evidence about the existence of a train containing gold were no more convincing than previous claims.
Nevertheless, the authorities decided to cordon-off search areas.
Three days earlier, Poland's Deputy Minister of Culture, Piotr Zuchowski, stated that local treasure hunters, "with a 99 percent degree of certainty", had found the very same train containing gold from the Third Reich that is talked about in the legends.
Zuchowski noted that if the speculation turns out to be true and the treasure is found, it will become property of the state treasury, in which case, the treasure will not be handed over to Russia.
In the middle of August, two clients of a law firm notified the authorities of the Polish city of Wa≈Çbrzych that they had found a train in a walled-in tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
