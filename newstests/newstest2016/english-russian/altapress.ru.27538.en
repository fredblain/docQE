Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear experts have created an atomic warhead.
North Korean authorities have reported that the country's main nuclear reactor - the nuclear complex in Yongbyon - is running "at full capacity".
A statement about this appeared on the website of the country's Central News Agency.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any moment to respond to the "aggression and nuclear threat from the USA", and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "in terms of both quantity and quality".
North Korean authorities conducted their most recent nuclear weapons test in 2013.
Moreover, since that time, no plans to resume full operation of the reactor had been reported.
Pyongyang claims that it has managed to produce a nuclear warhead.
Furthermore, the DPRK has never conducted a test of mid or short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
