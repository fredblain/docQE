Residents of a German city organise a celebration for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has emerged as the leader for accepting refugees, although it recently strengthened border controls to curb the influx of them.
According to the authorities, around 800 thousand migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts cite significantly higher figures.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90 thousand refugees have already arrived in the country.
Jenny Hill, a BBC correspondent, visited the city of Darmstadt, where residents offered migrants a very warm welcome.
