Vadim Skripchenko: "Krasnodar has various attack options".
Ahead of the 9th round match of the Premier League with Krasnodar, Acting Head Coach for Ural, Vadim Skipchenko, mentioned the opposing team's variety of offensive tactics.
According to the trainer, the "bulls" have a number of offensive game models in their arsenal.
The match will take place on September 21 and starts at 16:30 Moscow time.
We'll still have to see how we will play against Krasnodar, Ural's official website quotes Skripchenko as saying.
We have a whole week of training ahead of us.
That team has various attack options, and conducts its attacks in a multitude of ways, but, at the same time, we're not a slow team either, and that's why I believe that it will be a very interesting game.
In the lead up to this game, keeping in mind that Krasnodar is holding a Europa League match against Borussia Dortmund, we will try to prepare very well in order to secure the victory.
