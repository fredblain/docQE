Mikhail Antipov wins the Junior World Chess Championship.
The world chess championship for youth under 20 has finished in Khanty-Mansiysk.
The end of the championship turned out to be more than a little intriguing.
The winner was only decided in the final round, and it was Russian Mikhail Antipov who managed to finally overtake the Pole, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who looked set to claim the title.
Among the girls, victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chess player, Natalia Buksa.
By the middle of the world chess championship, which was held a the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, it looked as if there were almost no surprises left, since the Polish representative, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who, having delivered a series of four wins (the tournament is held according to the Swiss system of 13 rounds), confidently took the lead.
Given that Duda was rated as a favourite to win the championship, and generally is considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would throw away his lead seemed rather insignificant.
Even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to narrow the gap to just half a point, he still remained the favourite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov absolutely had to win in the 13th round in order to surpass the leader.
But even that wouldn't help if Duda won his match.
Moreover, this obligation to win could of course have an impact on the Russian chess player's game and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for Duda, who was facing Benjamin Bok, to finish his match.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player ended the stand-off against the Dutchman in a draw.
In this way, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of a possible 13 - but Antipov had better additional criteria.
It is for this reason that the administration of Khanty-Mansi autonomous area, whose governor is Natalia Komarova, which traditionally pays a lot of attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded the grand prize to him.
On the other hand, there were no surprises at the end of the girls' competitions.
The tournament leader, Natalia Buksa (Ukraine), only needed to not lose in the final match to win the title, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol didn't enable her to surpass Buksa.
The Russian athlete placed second, just half a point behind the champion.
