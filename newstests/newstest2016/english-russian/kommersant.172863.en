VimpelCom changes its regional structure.
The company is merging the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, and Siberia and the Far East into an Eastern region.
The project will be completed by November 1.
As Mikhail Slobodin, General Director for VimpelCom, notes, these changes are being made "to remain a strong player in the market", and develop the company "in new, and not always favourable, external conditions".
In an interview with Russia-24 television station, Mr. Slobodin confirmed that they intend to cut "tens of percents" of staff in Russia.
Rospotrebnadzor has inspected 78 Burger King eateries in Moscow and issued 367 compliance orders.
As a result, a restaurant on Volokolamsk Highway was fined 50 thousand roubles, while the establishment on Bolshaya Tulskaya Street was closed for 90 days, but has since resumed operations after addressing all of the violations.
43 eateries violated requirements for the organisation of their premises.
Among other things, violations included the unsatisfactory sanitary and hygienic conditions of the premises, failure to comply with requirements for ventilation, and, in some establishments, coliform bacteria were found.
Franchising for the Burger King brand belongs to Burger Rus LLC, owner of the Shokoladnitsa chain, Aleksandr Kolobov, with 293 eateries operating in Russia.
Igor Artemev, Head of the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), stated that the agency is against indexing freight tariffs at 10% and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by JSC Russian Railways.
At first they wanted a 17% indexing, and now they want 10%, in addition to multi-billion rouble subsidies from the budget, he said.
We are saying that this isn't right; it's too much: cut your costs, learn to economise, give up the extravagant private residences, football teams, and private TV stations, and stop spending money right, left, and centre.
He added that FAS has its own "much stricter" proposals, which are currently being discussed in government.
Polymetal is looking at the possibility of a net settlement with Sumeru Gold B.V. in place of a put-option on shares for a total amount of $300 mln, reported the gold producer.
In this case, Polymetal will need to pay Sumeru up to an additional $80 mln (the difference between the issue price of shares in Sumeru's favour and market quotes), which could be taken from available cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to exercise the option or demand additional payment.
Polymetal will not disclose the details of the negotiations.
The option was concluded as part of Polymetal's acquisition of the Kyzyl project in Kazakhstan.
