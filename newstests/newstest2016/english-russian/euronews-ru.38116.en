Evangelos Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us".
For a number of years, Evangelos Meimarakis was part of the centre-right government, which, according to those on the left, led the country into a financial crisis.
Now, having become the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he is mounting a challenge to Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist from Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Evangelos Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing to the SYRIZA coalition, but now, judging from the polls, New Democracy has matched it in terms of popularity.
What has changed since that time?
Evangelos Meimarakis: Greece has changed and we have too.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January of last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
Now, the country once again has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
Investors have fled because Mr. Tsipras chased them away.
Over the past nine months, Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the state the country was in in January and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
Now, they can easily compare these promises to what has actually transpired.
Daily life has become noticeably worse compared to in January, when the situation was getting better; moreover, this concerned the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Evangelos Meimarakis: The fact is that Greece, as we have come to understand in recent years, cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all the other countries where rescue programmes were in effect or continue to operate, political forces and all the ruling parties got together in order to implement the programme that they had reached a consensus on, while, at the same time, never abandoning their political or ideological independence.
That's why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutes will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If, on Monday, you become the new Prime Minister, will you comply with this agreement, or will you change it, at least in part?
Evangelos Meimarakis: Actually, we voted for Greece to move along the European path, because we understand all too well the devastating consequences that would have followed the country's withdrawal from the EU.
Right now, Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products; we have cohesion funds, and a Juncker package, and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost if there was no agreement with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are the result of how Mr. Tsipras conducted negotiations.
I know that Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Therefore, if Europe sees that the new Greek government, over the course of their first year in power, wants to restore order, acts rationally, and makes it understood that the country has the strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am confident that all of the assumed commitments, which cannot be implemented due to the fact that they are leading to a recession, could once again become a subject of negotiations, but only after a certain amount of time has passed.
It would be a mistake to assume that we could already go back to the negotiating table with our creditors in the first year of the new agreement, since they expect a full implementation of the deal.
If we want to regain their trust, we need to continue with privatisation, reforms, and the structural changes that were agreed on, while continuing to benefit from EU funding and greater investment opportunities, which we need to go ahead with to ensure better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government didn't present any compelling arguments about many key political issues, which we found out about while discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example associated with farmers' incomes.
We explained to our European partners that we weren't talking about a fixed monthly income, and, as such, it couldn't be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras' ministers never spoke about this.
That is to say, the Greek ministers were not prepared and were poorly informed, and, as a result, they conducted negotiations ineffectively and concluded a bad agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table as Mr. Juncker, Mr. Hollande, Ms. Merkel, and other European leaders.
Will what you say to them differ in any way from what your predecessor, Anthony Samaras, said to them?
Evangelos Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that, up until the end of 2014, we tried our best to fulfil the 2012 agreement, while avoiding the most contentious issues contained within it.
We pushed forward with reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we were operating under extraordinary circumstances.
The market crashed, and there were no prospective buyers in sight ready to pay the price the Greek government considered acceptable.
Back then, I was the parliamentary speaker and I succeeded in balancing the views of the three parliamentary groups, which, at that time, constituted a parliamentary majority.
In spite of their significant ideological disagreements on key bills, we had a working parliament, and this was in the midst of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations happening outside.
And we managed to guide the country to a state of normalcy, which would have continued to get better if the process had not been interrupted by early general elections that were the consequence of the December presidential election.
Euronews: Over the past weeks, a massive flow of refugees has been moving across Greek territory.
What do you think about this situation, and about the reaction of the European countries into which these people are seeking to enter?
Evangelos Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb that we will be forced to deal with after our election victory.
The reason for this is that the SYRIZA government didn't deal with this situation in the way that it should have.
In such matters, it pays to be proactive, because if the problem catches up with you, then you are only left with emergency measures.
And we now find ourselves in this situation.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA has done more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that the actions of the interim government, which has been provided with valuable assistance from the President of the Republic, who has called for an EU summit to be held, will enable us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees could leave the country, and take note: refugees, not illegal immigrants.
These are victims of the war in Syria: victims of certain extreme events that have happened to them.
This issue has a deeply humanitarian aspect to it, and we will support the position that European politicians should take in this new situation.
An appropriate decision should be made at the EU summit and it should also involve the United Nations.
We need to have better coordinated actions, more effective border controls, and refugee processing centres.
We also need to effectively use the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be in a position to deal with this urgent problem.
Euronews: Mister Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Evangelos Meimarakis: Thank you.
