Peter Moody alleges stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately.
He took aim at stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lidari's positive swab to cobalt, which he can not explain.
He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn't want it "to look like sour grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
When they start to think I'm not that's when I shouldn't be a trainer.
I would then have to consider what I do with my licence.
Earlier, Moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stables to offer information on what I was doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They obviously believe I'm a cheat.
If that's the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they've been incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today.
Should that make me think it's becoming personal?
Has RVL got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I've got no doubt what I'm saying now might make them think about that.
But I've got to the point now where I don't care and that saddens me.
That really saddens me.
I will put the pressure on them and onus on them to make a decision.
I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.
The trainer's frustration levels have built with the long-running cobalt inquiry involving Lidari and the late scratching had him saying that he could "throw my licence across the table."
Moody, best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black Caviar, labelled the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice had been applied to the horses legs, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I've got to accept full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg.
It could have had it last night.
It could have had it yesterday, which it did have.
It had it on race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the race day treatment using the poultice, which stewards have opened an inquiry into.
It is a joke.
People making these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.
