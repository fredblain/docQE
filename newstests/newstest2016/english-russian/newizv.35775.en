Sergei Naryshkin calls on the PA of the OSCE to cancel sanctions against parliamentarians of the Russian Federation.
Speaker of the State Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He spoke about this while addressing a session of the PA of the OSCE in Ulaanbaatar.
We judge these to be unacceptable actions, as an attack on the value of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this shouldn't happen again, because it is a manifestation of political insolence and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue", the politician said.
Moreover, Naryshkin called on members of the PA of the OSCE to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's return morality to politics.
Let's return dialogue and the law to the practice of international communication.
Let's return humanitarian ideals to the democratic world order.
"Hypocrisy has never ended well," he stated.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to create an interparliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I encourage members of the assembly to concentrate on the following concrete tasks to ensure security.
"First of all, a resolution of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convocation of our interparliamentary group", stated Naryshkin.
He also noted that the OSCE needed to be commended.
"It is practically the only collective forum where we can still discuss how to normalise the situation in Ukraine", the politician underscored.
To recap, the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and runs until September 18.
