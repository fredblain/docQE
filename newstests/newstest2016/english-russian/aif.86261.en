Why do eyelids often become irritated and red?
Ophthalmologist, Tatiana Levashova, answers:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
When forgetting to regularly clean our eyelids, often we ourselves contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The solution is simple:
do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, and carry a special moist cloth with you for your eyelids;
at least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the lid from the harmful substances that have accumulated on them over the course of the day.
It is useful to compliment these cleaning procedures with warm compresses that contain an infusion of medicinal herbs (sage, camomile), which thin out the thick secretions from the sebaceous glands, followed by a massage of the edges of the lids using the fingertips in circular movements;
when removing make-up, don't use products that contain alcohol.
They dry out and dehydrate the skin and contribute to the further thickening of secretions from the sebaceous glands.
