The Ministry of Industry and Trade: targeted food aid will not be similar to ration cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister for Industry and Trade of Russia, Viktor Yevtukhov, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be similar to the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
This issue concerns current targeted food assistance to the population and support of efficient domestic commodity producers.
I'm asking that people don't read too much into the phrase "food card".
I'd especially like to note that the proposed grocery cards shouldn't be confused with memories of widespread shortages from times past, or of a card system of distribution in which the quantity of goods is rationed.
So far, we have proposed an idea, and, if it is accepted, we will propose changes to the law", TASS quotes Mr. Yevtukhov as saying.
Earlier, Kommersant wrote that the programme to introduce food cards for low-income individuals had been submitted to the government.
