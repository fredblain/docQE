Vesti Economy - Nobel Laureate: Globalisation
Printing the Processes of Globalisation should have helped to reduce inequality in the world.
In practice, the situation looks entirely different; the income gap in developing economies is, on the contrary, growing.
Eric Maksin.
To correct this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, says Chief Research Fellow at the International Laboratory of Decision Choice and Analysis at the National Research University, Higher School of Economics (NRU HSE), and 2007 Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics, Eric Maksin.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly more open.
Proponents of globalisation predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have to a great extent come true", Maksin underscores.
So, for example, China and India achieved significant GDP per capita growth.
However, not everything is so rosy.
It was expected that globalisation would narrow the gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots" in poor countries, which presents itself in the form of income inequality, or, to be more exact, wages.
But, in reality, this inequality only became more pronounced, Eric Maksin points out in his article "Why global markets haven't reduced inequality in developing economies", which was published in The World Bank Economic Review, and was translated and quoted by the NRI HSE.
Eric Maksin, in cooperation with the economist and professor from Harvard University, Michael Kremer, developed an alternative theory, which demonstrates why income inequality increases in poor countries in proportion to the growth of globalisation, NRI HSE recalls.
Specific processes are at play in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maksin distinguishes four skill levels for specialists: A and B for wealthy countries, and C and D for poor ones.
After globalisation, the D specialists from poor countries don't have the required skill level to cooperate with specialists A and B from wealthy countries.
And while the wages of C level workers from poor countries rise thanks to cooperation with B colleagues from wealthy ones, D workers either don't experience the same effect or their salaries totally plunge.
The resulting effect is that the internationalisation of production will lead to an increase in the wage gap between these two categories of specialists in poor countries and, consequently, increased levels of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maksin have proposed a remarkably beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It makes it possible to explain why globalisation has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, tenured professor, Head of the International Laboratory of Decision Choice and Analysis, and Head of the Department of Mathematics at NRI HSE.
And, like any powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to an upsurge of empirical work in this field.
The solution to the problem, in Eric Maksin's opinion, is to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, the academic notes, don't have the money for this, and it's not profitable for companies to pay for their training.
In a situation like this, governments, international agencies, NGOs, and private foundations can play a significant role, Maksin believes.
The academic notes that the developed theory in no way calls for an end to the process of globalisation, which has brought and will bring benefits in the form of GDP growth of countries.
