10-13% is a comfortable rate for investment loans.
According to experts, the credit market for small and medium businesses shrunk by 40% between January and April of this year.
In your opinion, what is the situation like today?
After the panicked mood at the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs declined significantly.
The reason is obvious: a sharp rise in interest rates.
Financing at 25-30% per annum wasn't beneficial to anyone.
If previously, a bank could place all of its potential future problems, from arrears to defaults, at a higher rate, then now it is no longer possible to do this: the rates are already sky-high.
For the business community, the current level of interest rates for loans to SMEs isn't comfortable.
For a significant proportion of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their rate of return.
An interest rate level of between 10-13% would enable businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and make an attractive profit from them.
In your opinion, to what extent is the demand for credit by business owners being met?
The situation improved slightly after the Central Bank lowered the interest rate.
Credit resources became more readily available.
However, according to our observations, clients have started to apply for loans much more infrequently.
First of all, businesses can't discern the prospects for their development or future earnings.
Today, businesses have one option: they need to learn how to operate by focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It's necessary to more closely monitor current performance and control cash flow.
At the same time, when financial resources are available, it makes sense to use new technologies that allow for the modernisation of equipment and the reduction of production and energy costs.
All this, ultimately, enables companies to make their production more competitive and maintain their business even in an unstable economic situation.
Which main trends in the SME lending market will become more pronounced and will influence its development up until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast regarding a reduction of the average rate will depend a lot on the policies of the Central Bank; currently, the regulator is demonstrating consistency when it comes to lowering the key rate.
However, there's no point in waiting for a drastic decline in the cost of credit for SMEs.
In the current situation, the problem, first and foremost, is inflation, which necessitates a higher interest rate to obtain real earnings.
Moreover, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even with a lowering of rates by the Central Bank.
If we're talking about the level of arrears, then traditionally, small and medium size businesses, limited by their ability to replenish funds, as well as by possibilities for adjusting economic behaviour, will, of course, present a big risk to lenders.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
