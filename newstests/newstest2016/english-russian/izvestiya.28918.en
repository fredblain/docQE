Imported yachts will be exempt from paying customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other watercraft for leisure or sport from paying customs duties or taxes.
The necessary changes to the list of goods eligible for temporary duty-free entry were prepared by the ministry under instructions from the government of the Russian Federation.
Yelena Lashkina, aide to the Minister of Economic Development, reported this to Izvestia.
In June 2015, as a result of a trip to Crimea, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instructed a number of government agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Customs Service, and the Federal Tourism Agency - to prepare proposals to create favourable conditions for yachting in the costal regions of the country.
In turn, experts point out that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, servicing, and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to store their vessels abroad: approximately â‚¬200 mln every year enters the coffers of European states for the maintenance, repair, and servicing of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft resolution of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amendments to the List of Goods temporarily imported with full exemption from the payment of customs duties and taxes in relation to imported yachts and other watercraft used for leisure and sport".
According to the ministry, this would certainly support the creation of favourable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal regions of the country, Lashkina noted.
This matter was submitted for consideration by the sub-commission on customs tariffs, non-tariff regulation, and protective measures in foreign trade of the Governmental Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which held a meeting in September, and, following the discussion, it was also approved by the government agencies.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure for full conditional exemption at the time of importation is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, following approval of the meeting minutes of the sub-commission by the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will present the proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion by member states of the EEU, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods that are fully exempt from payment of customs duties and taxes includes goods that are necessary for facilitating foreign trade and international cooperation, for use in the fields of science, culture, film, sport, and tourism, for the provision of international aid, and others. These other goods include: office equipment (personal computers, typewriters), monitoring and measuring instruments, drilling equipment, stage costumes and sets, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, race cars, motorcycles, sport aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments, and items for religious ceremonies.
The press service for the Ministry of Transportation of the Russian Federation told Izvestia that they had prepared compulsory regulations for the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosiya, and Yevpatoriya, which provide for simplified procedures for registering the entry and departure of small-sized, sport sailboats, and recreational watercraft in the seaport.
The Ministry of Transportation has given orders to the captains of seaports in Crimea to ensure the administration of the simplified procedures for the entry of small-sized, sport sailboats, and recreational watercraft into the seaport and for the departure of the above-listed vessels from the seaport.
The Ministry of Transportation has also prepared draft decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation regarding confirmation of the water boundaries of the seaports of Crimea.
Decrees concerning Yalta and Feodosiya have already been enacted, while the others are still in the approval stage, noted the agency's press service.
It is the opinion of the Ministry of Transportation that state control, classification, inspection, and registration of small-sized vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be conducted by the Republic of Crimea and by Sevastopol.
The issue is that yachting is very difficult in Russia because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If one looks at the South of Italy or France, there is an entire and ever-growing industry, involving a large number of people.
In Russia, however, everything is at a virtual standstill.
Our coastline is not very interesting; the only part where it is possible to operate yachts year-round is in the Black Sea near Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, and Anapa.
But the big difficulty in this area is that the rules of the border service are very strict: in order to cruise in a yacht, it is necessary to register for a lot of permits.
Besides, within Russia, there isn't even anywhere to refuel.
A yacht could cruise on its fuel reserves for two days and then it will be faced with the problem of where to find more, said, Denis Novikov, Director of Sales for the company Nordmarine.
In terms of places to store yachts, there are now special docks in Moscow and Saint Petersburg that can accommodate yachts up to 30m. Yachts are also sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden, and Germany to be stored.
Novikov noted that buyers of yachts are wealthy people, but that, since the beginning of the economic crisis, demand for yachts has declined.
