Drafts of the script for the film "Citizen Kane" to be put up for auction.
Representatives of the auction house, Profiles in History, announced plans to put up for auction drafts of the film script for "Citizen Kane", which is considered one of the best works of director, screenwriter, and actor Orson Welles.
The auction will commence on September 29, in the city of Calabash, with three draft scripts, valued at $20-30 thousand a piece, being presented, AP reports.
The first of the drafts, written in the 1940s by Herman Mankiewicz, is the earliest draft of those held in private collections, and is entitled, "The American", which was the working title for the film.
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, while the third is the final draft of the film.
