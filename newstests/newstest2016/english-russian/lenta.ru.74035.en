The President of Syria names the reason for the West's enmity towards Russia.
The West's grievances towards countries like Syria, Russia, and Iran, in fact stem from the fact that they are sovereign states.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad expressed this opinion in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia-24, NTV, Rossiya Segodnya, TASS, Interfax, and Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
According to Assad, the West cannot accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, they would like to remove one person and replace them with another person who will act in the interests of Western countries and not in the interests of their homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the abrupt shift in Western media since the beginning of the revolution in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "transformed from being a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator, who represses the Russian opposition, and who came to power through undemocratic means, in spite of the fact that he was chosen via democratic elections recognised in the West".
Putin urged the international community to join forces with Assad in the fight against Islamic State.
Commenting on frequent statements by the West that Assad must leave, he noted that a president comes to power with the consent of the people, via elections, and if he is to leave, then it is at the behest of the people, and not according to a decision by the US, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference, or a Geneva communiqu√©.
"If the people want him to stay, the president will stay, and if the opposite is true, then he ought to leave immediately", he underscored.
Assad described Russia and Iran as friendly countries and recalled that they are cooperating with them.
Syria is also jointly fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
Speaking about military assistance from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, on the economy, and in the military sphere.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is providing us with military equipment.
"Of course there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran; however, this exchange has always been in place", he explained.
As concerns other states, we are open to cooperation with any of them if they possess a serious willingness to combat terrorism.
"We do not see this in relation to the so-called antiterrorist and anti-ISIS coalition led by the US", Assad pointed out.
The death toll has surpassed 230 thousand people, and the number of refugees has reached 11.5 million.
A portion of territory has been seized by the terrorist group, Islamic State, which is banned in Russia.
The international coalition headed by the US is striking at IS positions from the air.
