It has been requested that the Bible be checked for compliance with the law on the protection of children from information
A resident of Novosibirsk has filed a request with the regional prosecutor's office to check the Bible for compliance with the Federal Law "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development"; a correspondent from Sib.fm examined the request filed on September 16.
The author of the request stated that, on August 26, 2015, they bought a bible, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society, from the Kitai-Gorod store on Krasny Prospect.
He found fragments in the text of the book that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development".
The request was accepted for review by the prosecutor's office for the city of Novosibirsk on September 16.
A decision on the Novosibirsk resident's request will be issued within 30 days.
The point of this has nothing to do with banning the book.
It's much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, the applicant said in a comment to a correspondent from Sib.fm.
Besides, this is an entirely valid issue that will stir up society.
Those who have never done so before, will start rereading the Bible.
