Joel Freeland: "I will assume Kaun's duties in CSKA".
CSKA newcomer, Joel Freeland, stated that he doesn't believe in the Red Army curse.
The Brit also expressed confidence that his new club will manage to overcome the negative streak and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itoudis several times this summer, and, of course, after I joined the team, R-Sport quotes Freeland. Essentially, I will assume the duties of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in terms of defensive formations and offensively in the key, and I think I can handle this.
Sure, I'll need some time to adjust to centre position, since in the NBA I played more as a forward.
Now I will have to stand up to a large centre rival, but I used to do this before, so I think I'll be able to handle it now.
The Red Army team last won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they have made it to the "Final Four" six times, but each time they weren't able to play their best basketball.
There is a perception that someone has put a hex on the team.
But that's just the essence of the game: you can't win forever.
Of course it's difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we show the best we are capable of, then we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague; I really think so.
I've always wanted to win this title; the Muscovites have already won this tournament, and I think that this will be CSKA's year.
As far as the hex is concerned, I'm not a superstitious person and I don't believe in curses of any kind.
I believe in hard work and determination: if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before games; I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
