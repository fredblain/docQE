Mandates allotted to parties.
Yesterday, the Nizhny Novgorod electoral commission summed up the results of the city duma elections according to municipal district, which allocated 12 deputy seats awarded according to party lists.
As per usual, many complaints about violations during the elections were heard from representatives of the CPRF, who accused the electoral commission of "concealing fraud".
The opposition's objections were not accepted.
At the same time, the electoral commission denied the Communists of Russia party's attempt to organise a referendum concerning the elimination of fees for capital repairs to apartment blocks.
The city electoral commission has officially released the results of the elections to the Nizhny Novgorod City Duma according to municipal electoral district.
Altogether, 1.03 mln people were included on the voters list for Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand voting ballots were issued at precinct commissions, and 268 thousand voters cast their ballots in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were determined to be void, while 24 remain unaccounted for.
Yesterday, 12 seats were allocated among political parties according to the votes they received.
According to United Russia's lists, six deputy seats go to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
Party leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, received the only seat for LDPR.
Two seats for the CPRF were allocated to Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma Deputy, Aleksandr Tarnaev.
Three seats for A Just Russia went to Aleksandr Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov, and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, these candidates need to determine within five days whether or not they will work as deputies in the city duma: in the event of a refusal of a mandate, the seat will go to the next candidate on the party list.
Chairman for the city electoral commission, Aleksandr Makeev, informed members of the commission that he was establishing shifts to "dispatch telegrams to Zhirinovsky and the others" for the purpose of refusing their mandates.
Upon approval of the protocol on the results of the election, representatives from the CPRF filed complaints about multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, an advisory member of the city electoral commission from the CPRF, proposed rejecting the results of the vote in four districts, Nos. 21-24, recalling how, under an order from the head of the administration for Sormovsky district, the entrance to the administration building where the four district commissions were located was closed.
State Duma deputies, the candidates themselves, and observers weren't able to get inside for a long time, and the public outcry, which resulted in a storming of the doors to the district administration building, was shown on television.
All observers and advisory members of the commission were able to attend the meetings of the district committees.
The head of the administration only suspended their access when the voting had ended and the precinct commissions still had not arrived to hand over their ballots.
It was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the head of the administration was corrected, and interested parties were permitted to attend all meetings", retorted Natalia Andryushina, member of the city electoral commission.
The communists objected that Lyudmila Aristova, a deputy in the regional legislative assembly, was illegally detained in the blockaded administration building for more than four hours, and a complaint regarding this has been sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that, on election day, several precinct electoral commissions started to seal ballot boxes at between 6 and 7 o'clock the morning, placing early voting ballots inside of them.
Moreover, no one notified the advisory members of the commission and observers, and, as such, they only arrived right at the start of the elections at 8 a.m.
The communists are confident that, in the morning before the opening of polling stations, ballots could have been stuffed into the ballot boxes without supervision.
However, according to Aleksandr Makeev, the city electoral commission, which has already investigated more than 124 various complaints, didn't find any violations involving the stuffing of ballot boxes with unaccounted for ballots.
Members of the commission also did not support the suggestion made by their colleague from A Just Russia, Maria Popova, via the regional electoral commission, to introduce amendments to regional legislation in order to clearly establish the time at which envelopes containing early voting ballots, which then end up in ballot boxes, are opened.
"As concerns this individual initiative: at least contact the Central Election Committee", Aleksandr Makeev advised Ms. Popova.
Towards the end of the meeting, Sergei Samokhin, a member of the CPRF, began to hurl loud accusations at the chairman, yelling that the electoral commission was ignoring dozens of complaints and concealing electoral fraud.
"You're not at a protest; be more careful with your claims!" replied the offended chairman of the electoral commission.
Ultimately, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
The electoral commission must confirm the overall results of the elections by September 27, after which, within a period of three weeks, the first meeting of the sixth convocation of the Nizhny Novgorod City Duma will be announced.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the city electoral commission denied the Communists of Russia political party's registration of an advocacy group to conduct a local referendum.
According to the documents, the party members were planning on bringing up two issues for discussion with residents of Nizhny Novgorod: do you agree that the collection of fees for capital repairs to apartment blocks should be "immediately cancelled", and should rates for housing and communal services "be frozen until 2020".
However, lawyer for the Duma, Irina Maslova, made it clear that the appeal by the Communists of Russia contravenes the law.
