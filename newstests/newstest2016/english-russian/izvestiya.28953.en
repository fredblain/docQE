Prisons are asked to create separate blocs for transgender people.
In October 2015, at the Public Council of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of rights of convicted offenders, the possibility of creating separate blocs in penal colonies for transgender people and transvestites will be discussed among other issues.
A member of the council, Vladislav Grib, spoke to Izvestia about this.
According to him, depending on the number of prisoners in Russia who are questioning their gender identity, it may be possible to provide separate cells or blocs in domestic prisons, or even (if there are a lot of such criminals) the establishment of a special penal colony for transsexuals in the future.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that assigning a citizen to serve out a sentence in such isolated areas would only be possible after the convicted person had gone through the necessary medical examination that proves that the criminal is actually a person who identifies themselves as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is sure that separating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving out their sentences.
According to him, the proposed method is being successfully applied abroad: in a pre-trial detention facility (where the accused stay until the court's ruling), separate cells are made available for transgender people, and in correctional facilities there are special blocs.
Currently, this is the only way of dealing with these types of criminals.
Obviously, they need to be separated, as the presence of transvestites and transgender people in regular cells is dangerous for them: it causes suffering for their families and a sea of troubles for FSIN staff.
The humiliation of trans people by their cellmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
It's necessary to figure out where to place them, depending on how large of a city it is, and how many criminals there are that are questioning their gender identity.
Separate pre-trial detention facilities aren't necessary, just separate cells, and blocs in prisons.
Yes, a separate penal colony is a possibility if there turn out to be many transgendered people.
As Grib explains, a bloc could hold 50 or 100 people, and if one specialised building is established in Russia, then convicted transsexuals from any region could be sent there to serve out their sentences.
Citizens are held in pre-trial detention facilities according to the place where the crime was committed, and, as such, the arrival of transvestites or transgender people from different territorial subjects during the investigation and court proceedings is unrealistic; however, introducing this practice in a separate colony, for those who have already been convicted is definitely possible, Grib believes.
To recap, yesterday, law enforcement officers could not decide which pre-trial detention facility - male or female - to assign to 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), detained for drug possession, and, as a result, the man with a girlish appearance was not arrested.
He was sent home on the written condition that he would not leave town.
This news was widely discussed on social networks and in the media, since, as of yet, there is no procedure in Russia for holding transgender people in pre-trial detention facilities and penal colonies.
Russian human rights advocate and activist in the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender), Nikolai Alekseev, supports the idea of creating special places for transgender people to serve out their sentences, noting that, abroad, it is also possible to place people in penal colonies - male or female - depending on their own preferences.
Given the climate in Russian prisons, this is the correct recommendation.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but the problem is real, just as is the issue of ensuring the safety of homosexuals in prisons, says Alekseev.
Prisons should be safe; therefore, separate blocs could be established for this sake, as well as for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.
Moreover, Alekseev doubts that there will be a lot of citizens in Russia who will be ready to pass themselves off as transsexuals just to get into somewhere other than a regular penal colony.
Of course, a medical examination could be introduced before placing people into a penal colony for transgender people; however, things are not always so straightforward.
For example, in the US, one prisoner, Chelsea Manning, looked like a man, but once already in prison, announced that he wanted to change his sex, says Alekseev.
A person can feel like they are anyone at all.
However, as of yet, there are no separate facilities for transgender people to serve out their sentences, and I doubt that prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people or fathom the complexities of their orientation or gender identification.
At the same time, international expert on issues of reproductive health in the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for assigning transsexual criminals to a penal colony could significantly delay the start of the convicts serving their sentences.
A committee is created: this is a question of sexology, with psychiatrists conducting long-term examinations - this is not just one test - on the basis of which a highly precise diagnosis is made.
Modern practices in psychiatry make this possible.
This is why, before a sex change, potential patients undergo such expert evaluation; they will definitively show whether or not a sex change requiring surgery is a necessary measure, says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to introduce this system in relation to convicted individuals; after all, on average, it takes an entire month to conduct such an examination.
The doctor, in spite of the fact that he supports the general idea of creating separate blocs for transsexuals, also doubts that it would be appropriate under current economic conditions to allocate funds towards the construction of new facilities and medical examinations: transgender people in Russia are few and far between.
It's difficult to come up with a number as there are no official statistics, but if one considers that homosexuals account for around 5%, then it is fair to say that there are even fewer transgender people, and that those that have such an inclination and also commit crimes comprise an entirely small number, said Lordkipanidze.
Currently, upon submitting a request to the administration of a penal colony, homosexuals and transgender people are already able to obtain separate conditions of confinement.
