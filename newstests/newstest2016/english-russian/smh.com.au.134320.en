Man coaxed from Canning River after soggy police chase
The Canning Vale constable remained dry as he coaxed the man from the Canning River.
A Perth man's bid to lose a police tail came undone after he found himself in shallow, muddy water just metres from a police officer trying to "coax him gently back to shore."
Canning Vale police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect he tried to ditch them by heading into the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not getting out, 'come and get me'," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he employed a safer tactic - "good police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try and escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins ditched his car to avoid a booze bus and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but did inspire locals to begin planning a tongue-in-cheek Ben Cousins biathlon.
