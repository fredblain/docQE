Head Coach for Team Greece, Fotis Katsikaris, commended his team following the EuroBasket 2015 quarterfinal match against Spain (71-73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by a few mistakes.
It was a big game, AFP quotes Katsikaris as saying.
We were preparing for a great game by the Spaniards.
We tried to outplay them on the defence, but mistakes in the defence determined the fate of this meeting.
It's sad, but I am proud of my boys.
They fought until the final second.
