Zhirinovsky "loses" Amur region.
Today, I watched the buffoonery of Zhirinovsky in the State Duma with admiration.
He was doing these things when our generation was still learning how to sell newspapers, and remains in excellent form to this very day.
The theme of the address was something along the lines of "LDPR's protest against the results of the elections in Amur region".
He can't wave around protocols that he doesn't have; by all accounts, LDPR doesn't have any other protocols than those signed by the electoral commissions.
Then he brings up the second place winner, Ivan Abramov, and yells something like: "Here's the winner of the election!"
And then, from no reason, he starts attacking Rodina, and then, after the ruckus with the chairperson this time, he leads the fraction out of the meeting hall, while literally crying out: "All of you and your fronts are crooks and thieves".
The press, of course, places the emphasis not on Abramov, but on the scandal and the fraction's walkout as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
In reality, Volfovich beautifully and elegantly lost Amur Region along with Abramov.
For the whole country, this was just another one of Zhirinovsky's escapades in the same vein as his "Scumbag!" tirade, and not at all a protest by a political party against the results of an actual election.
Yet the fraction has formally made a row of it, and the elections, if we are to believe the party's website and Ivan Abramov's Facebook account, have not been confirmed, but the leader has obviously backed away from the issue.
He lets the dead in Amur bury their own dead, but then he preaches against United Russia in general, and against Rodina, which is guilty of nothing at all.
An elegant solution to save face and, for the time being, avoid a loud scandal.
It's an entirely different matter that Abramov now finds himself in an odd position.
Other than an outcry from the leadership, he wasn't expecting anything: there are no alternative protocols available.
On the one hand, he isn't the focus of the public's attention, but on the other, for a small circle of people, he became the formal reason for both an insult against a respected champion, and, even more importantly, boorish attacks against United Russia and the All-Russia People's Front (APF).
And here, of course, it's necessary for him to think very seriously about what needs to be done.
Because he could turn from being the main beneficiary of the elections, the number 2 politician in the region, and the number 1 candidate in the only regional single-seat constituency, into a pariah who was successfully used by his own party's leadership and its provocateur-extraordinaire for the benefit of that same APF and someone else's party leadership.
Well, if Zhirinovsky didn't exist, then it definitely would be necessary to invent him and dutifully follow his every move.
Trump has a lot of work to do to catch up with him.
There is news that LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary session.
That is to say: all that fuss for nothing.
Only, the Abramov issue has been buried under itself.
It's beautiful really.
