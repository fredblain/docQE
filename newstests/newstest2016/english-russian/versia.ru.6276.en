Facebook will delete comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to delete posts and comments in which a negative assessment of migrants and refugees is given.
Furthermore, the social network will provide financial support to organisations that collect user complaints about content that violates Facebook's community standards.
Facebook's management intends to fight the rise of xenophobia and racism on the network in cooperation with Germany's Ministry of Justice.
As such, yesterday, the agency's head, Heiko Maas, stated that the Ministry of Justice was currently working with social media specialists to create special groups of moderators.
Group participants will be required to monitor and delete inappropriate comments about migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is expected that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notices explaining the reason for the deletion of their entries.
The organisations and specialists involved in collecting incoming complaints from network users about offensive posts will also assist with the timely blocking of content that violates Facebook's community standards.
Facebook's management intends to provide them with the required financial support.
The decision to delete posts containing negative remarks about migrants and refugees was made by the social network's management and Germany's Ministry of Justice following a significant rise in xenophobic attitudes on the German section of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for this has been the migration crisis, unprecedented in size, gripping the countries of the European Union recently.
For example, in Germany today, all of the locations designated for accommodating refugees are already overcrowded.
Yesterday, the country's authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants at the former concentration camp, Buchenwald.
The forced migrants from Middle Eastern and African countries are being housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held during the Nazi regime.
