Kadyrov's original complaint regarding the book, "A Prayer to God", has been received by the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Court.
The original appeal by the Presidential Representative for Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, against the decision to recognise the book, "A Prayer to God: It's meaning and place in Islam", as "extremist material", has been received by the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Court, Interfax reports, with reference to the chairperson of the city court, Aleksandr Chukhrai.
The court is now waiting for possible objections from parties to the proceedings.
Chukhrai declined to comment on statements by several deputies from the Russian State Duma about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence agencies and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such stupidity themselves", he said.
On September 11, the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the decision by Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognise the book as "extremist material".
An appeal from the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Prosecutor's Office was received Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to only recognise the opinion of the author of the book as extremist and not the verses from the Koran.
It is the opinion of the prosecutor's office that the judge made the wrong ruling", Chukhrai stated.
The decision to recognise the book as "extremist material" was made on August 12, 2015.
Specifically, the following quotes from the Koran were dubbed "extremist": "We worship You and we pray to You for help" and "Do not invoke anyone along with Allah".
Kadyrov has called those who made the ruling about the book "devils and provocateurs".
He has requested State Duma deputies to legislatively ban the court's decision concerning the texts from the holy book.
"I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should adopt a law that would ban court rulings related to texts from the Koran and other Divine Scriptures", Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram account.
