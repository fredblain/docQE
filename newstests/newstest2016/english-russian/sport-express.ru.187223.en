Rafael Benitez: "I'll repeat this as often as necessary: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world".
Head Coach for Real, Rafael Benitez, expressed his satisfaction with a huge win in a 1st round match in the group stage of the Champions League against Shakhtar (4-0).
The expert commended forward Cristiano Ronaldo who scored three goals.
The match wasn't easy, because Shakhtar knows how to use the ball, the UEFA's official website quotes Benitez as saying.
The opponents didn't have many chances, but their counterattacks always present a risk.
I won't say that Real played ideally, but we had plenty of goal-scoring opportunities.
I am satisfied that we didn't let in any goals and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo reaffirmed his level.
This is the best player in the world; I'll repeat this as often as necessary.
