On the day before a match against Barcelona in the group stage of the Champions League, Roma midfielder, Daniele De Rossi, noted the importance of staying compact and having each other's back in a game against such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21:45 Moscow time.
As a reminder, Sport Express will broadcast the live match ticker.
Barcelona is a special opponent and a good team with excellent players, the UEFA's official website quotes De Rossi as saying.
It's difficult to play against the blue garnets; after all, they not only have a unique style, but also remarkable individuals.
In order to win against them, we will have to work hard throughout the entire match and watch out for each other.
Messi is almost always successful when he starts jockeying, so we will have to stay close together and organised.
