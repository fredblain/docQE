Roger Cañas: "At home, Astana can score points off of anyone at all".
Following a 1st round match against Benfica (0-2) in the group stage of the Champions League, Astana midfielder, Roger Cañas, expressed confidence that his team would continue to improve the quality of its game in the future.
According to the midfielder, Astana players are capable of scoring points off of any opponent on their home field.
In spite of the fact that the match turned out to be hard for us, I can say that we played well, the UEFA's official website quotes Cañas as saying. We lacked a bit of courage in the offense.
Benfica is in a higher class, but in a home game, I think we can count on scoring points off of them.
It's totally possible.
But first, we need to think about Galatasaray and Atletico.
At home games, we can score points off of anyone.
