The new Balkan route: refugees are coming into the EU through Croatia.
"Open up!" chant hundreds of refugees at the Horgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border to immigrants.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to test out other possible routes into the EU.
One of them is bypassing the closed border with Serbia through Romania.
Another is through Croatia and Slovenia into Austria.
According to some reports, the buses that transported refugees from Serbia into Hungary are now being sent to the town of Šid on the Croatian border.
The drivers have received orders from the authorities to carry on without stopping.
Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs Nebojša Stefanović pledged that his country was doing everything in its power to help the refugees, but that it had limited resources:
Our job entails protecting Serbia to the greatest extent possible.
On the other hand, we should also help these people, make sure that they are treated humanely.
But this has already become a Europe-wide problem.
It will not be easy to solve; no country in Europe can deal with it on its own, especially such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open its border to the refugees who don't want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is uncompromising:
If someone is claiming to be a refugee, they ought to fill-out the necessary documents for this in Serbia.
And if they don't do this, then they will not be permitted to enter our country, because it is completely safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometre fence along the border with Serbia.
But Orban is not content to stop there: he plans on erecting a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already declared that this is incompatible with European principles.
