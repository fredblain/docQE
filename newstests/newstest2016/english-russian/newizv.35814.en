I only basked in my victory for two or three days.
World Champion in Track and Field, Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called triumphant for the 24-year-old track and field athlete from Barnaul, Sergei Shubenkov.
He managed to win at the European Team Championships in his best event, the 110m hurdles, set several records, and, most importantly, become world champion, moreover, the first in our nation's history of sprint hurdles.
Furthermore, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, taking third place in the overall rankings.
Novye Izvestia asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the past season.
Sergei, is the season not over for you yet?
That's right, I'm planning to compete at the Military World Games, which will be held this October in Korea, and then I will think about taking a rest.
Of course, right now, I will be training at home, in Barnaul, but being at home is still quite another situation.
Anything is easier than travelling around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favourite time of year.
The end of August and beginning of September is a wonderful time.
The passions from the start of the main season have simmered down, and the weight of responsibility isn't so heavy.
You can compete for enjoyment, in a "laid back" state.
Also, you know that your break is coming up soon...
And do you get fatigued?
After all, it's been an exceptional season, with a multitude of positive emotions...
Fatigue always starts to set in towards the end of the season.
And here, it's not important whether you won more or lost more.
Every competition is stressful.
Never-ending flights and travel: it all takes a toll on the body.
You get physically and emotionally fatigued.
But right now, of course, I'm in good spirits.
What am I saying - I couldn't be happier!
Do you often think about the moment you crossed the finish line at the World Championships in Beijing?
Sometimes.
Besides, you journalists won't let me forget about it either.
But, in general, I don't think it's good for an athlete to live for their old victories and run through their successful races over and over again.
I only basked in my victory for two or three days and then I had to start moving again.
Did your preparations for this remarkable season differ significantly from usual?
I can't say that there was anything particularly different.
We started to train back in December, but I skipped the winter competition season.
At first, I trained at home in Barnaul, then at training camps, and then again at home.
As per usual.
But my coach and I set a goal: to try and reach a new level where I had never been before.
I spent almost the entire winter laying down the foundations for this.
I ran lots of cross-country, did exercises for overall physical conditioning, which included lifting and squats, and we built up my back muscles.
Then we moved onto hurdles training, and worked a lot on technique.
Did you keep an eye on how your competitors were performing?
I always try and do this, and it's an advantage of the Internet age that there aren't any issues with this.
I watched the European Winter Championships, and the French swept the whole podium in sprint hurdles!
Then I thought: I need to do something to break up this group.
With each race this season, you kept on improving your results.
Did this give you confidence?
All of my previous seasons have unfolded in pretty much the same way.
There was never a time when I was first running 13.20 and then would run 13.50.
I always work out my form gradually.
The most important thing is that I wanted to run it in under 13 seconds.
Every effort was directed, first and foremost, on achieving this result.
But the paradox is that, even though you feel prepared for this feat, you aren't always able to show your readiness to do this at competitions.
Like how it was at the London Olympics for example?
To be honest, I tried to forget that semi-final race right away (Shubenkov wasn't able to make it to the finals - Ed.).
I was very well prepared, and could have run it in under 13 seconds.
And even if I had repeated my best result at that time, I would have been the bronze medallist at the Games.
But it just didn't work out.
Do you remember your first world championships?
What do you think?
It was in Daegu.
I really wanted to make it into the finals back then; that was kind of the ultimate goal.
But I got knocked out first thing in the morning, during the preliminary races.
That's when I understood that recklessly rushing headlong into it meant that I wasn't going to get anywhere.
Two years later at the World Championships in Moscow, I had already made it into the finals with a better time.
I remember well how I felt before the final race: I really wanted to win the gold even back then!
How do you manage to build-up a decent speed and still not lose your head or tune-out?
Well, this is the most difficult thing.
You need to be careful and focused on technique in order to not knock down the hurdles.
I've noticed that when you aren't fixated on the end result, but on the process, it's a lot easier.
But the greatest rush is when you realise that you're running and everything seems to be working out on its own!
Honestly, it's well worth it.
A lot of our athletes from the provinces aim to move closer to the capital after their first notable successes.
Have you ever had those thoughts?
Home is always better.
And I can't even imagine where I'd be without my coach; who needs me?
It might be nice to have slightly better conditions, but I try to be content with what I have.
Have you and Klevtsovy been together for a long time?
Since I was 12 years old, when I first started track and field.
Actually, I started training with his wife, who worked with the children, and then later she passed me on.
I started with sprinting, then long jump and triple jump.
There was a children's combined event: that's when they toss a ball and long jump from that spot...
At 14, I tried the hurdles and liked them.
With my very first race, I was able to qualify for the second adult category.
So I just stayed with it.
Have you ever been stricken with fear in front of the hurdles?
Somehow I was able to work things out with them right away.
But I've always had to put a lot of work into my technique.
I worked for so long on just one stride!
But there is no way around this routine.
Your technique needs to be constantly honed, so that you could wake me up in the middle of the night, and I would get up and run hurdles.
Everyone that saw your race in Beijing claims that it was a really beautiful race.
Thank you.
I quite enjoyed it myself.
Usually I don't re-watch my races, but with this one I couldn't hold myself back.
But you have to keep working on efficiency: there's always room for improvement.
Are you now afraid that a victory one year before the Olympic Games will weigh like a heavy burden on your shoulders?
As people say in situations like this: I will try to live up to expectations.
Since I've chosen to take this road, that means that I have to see it through to the end.
My coach loves to say: if you're not a weakling, you shouldn't feel any extra weight.
And I completely agree with him on this.
