Why I'm A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma
Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it won't, I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made back in January, via his best friend, and though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I've come to dread it.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately.
I cannot do that.
I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls, and one visit lasting two-and-a-half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I will just have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but still thinks I'm wrong to do what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip has taken issue with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he thinks the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be alongside me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.
I won't go over all the details again here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being an accessory after the fact.
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I will watch him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.
What you will get from me is what it's like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death.
