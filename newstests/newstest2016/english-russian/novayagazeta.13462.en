Kerry warns Lavrov about the risk of Russia's support for the regime of Bashar al-Assad.
During a telephone conversation with the head of Russia's MFA, Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would exacerbate the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia's support of President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal in the fight against extremism if we don't also focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria with the help of an effective transfer of political power", reads a statement published on the US Department of State's website.
Kerry reaffirmed the United States' commitment to fighting the group, Islamic State (the activities of which were banned in Russia by the Supreme Court), in a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "can never be a trusted member" of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved via a political transition away from Assad.
The White House has threatened Russia with isolation on account of supporting the Assad regime.
Yesterday, White House Press Secretary Joshua Earnest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
By way of an alternative, Earnest suggested joining the international coalition, which is conducting antiterrorist operations against Islamic State.
Lately, the media has frequently reported about the presence of Russian military personnel in Syria.
To which the head of Russia's MFA, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years already and are assisting the Syrians to master equipment to use against the Islamists.
