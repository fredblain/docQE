Doctors call for a ban on boxing.
The Board of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries received during a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
According to the International Boxing Federation (IBF), the battle for one of the regional titles in the 57.15 kg weight category, which was held last Friday, ended in a knockout victory for the Filipino in the 12th round.
Brown, however, was sent to the hospital with a traumatic brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical and he was connected to life support.
In the professional boxing ring, Brown scored 22 victories, suffered only two losses, and had one fight that ended in a draw.
He leaves behind two children.
This is already the second fatal case amongst Australian boxers over the past six months.
In March, Braydon Smith, a 23-year-old student, died from injuries received in the ring.
Now the AMA is recommending against participating in this type of sport, or, even better from their point of view, banning it outright.
I understand that this happens unintentionally, said the organisation's Vice President Stephen Parnis.
However, in the form in which boxing currently exists, these situations, where an athlete suffers a haemorrhage or a brain injury that results in death or serious injury, will continue to happen.
It is for this reason that the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional organisation that unites medical practitioners and medical students.
