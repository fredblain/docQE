Russian citizen confesses to committing the largest cyber attack in US history.
Russian citizen, Vladimir Drinkman, accused of the largest cyber attack in US history, has confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, Reuters reports.
During the federal court trial in the state of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to conspiring to gain unauthorised access to computer systems in order to commit fraud.
During the hearing, the Russian citizen spoke about conspiring with three citizens of Russia and one citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyber attacks against 15 companies.
Total damages resulting from the accused individuals' actions are estimated at 300 million dollars.
"Defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer systems, represent a threat to our economic well-being, our personal lives, and our national security", stated US State Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is facing 30 years imprisonment as well as a fine in the amount of one million dollars.
During sentencing, the court will take the Russian citizen's confession into consideration and possibly shorten his sentence.
Drinkman's sentence will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At that time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was also taken into custody.
The latter denies involvement in the crimes of which he is accused.
