Clashes between migrants and the police occur on the Hungarian border.
Refugees staged a protest on the Serbian border close to the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which grew into clashes with law enforcement officers.
As a result, Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants are throwing stones at the police and trying to remove the fence that was placed at the border.
Reinforcements were sent to the scene of the clashes, and the police are taking measures to deal with the migrants' aggressive actions and their attempts to violate the border.
As Agence France-Presse reports, the refugees were able to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants ran into Hungarian territory.
Some refugees are leaving for the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, BBC reports.
The country's authorities have allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and have provided them with transport from there to the desired country.
According to information from Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, Hungary's parliament strengthened the law on migration and border protection.
The amendments make provisions for the involvement of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those illegally crossing the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for processing requests for asylum.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, by virtue of which he will be deported and will not be allowed to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian parliament also intends, in the near future, to consider the issue of handing over the responsibility for protecting the perimeter of the country's parliament to the Hungarian armed forces.
At the end of June, Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175 km-long barbed-wire fence on the border with Serbia to curb the influx of migrants and refugees into the country.
