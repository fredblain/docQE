Fans from Europe risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 hotels in Saint Petersburg have the right to house the tourists who will arrive in 2018 to watch the World Cup in football.
So far, the rest of the hotels haven't been rushing to get the necessary permit.
According to experts, this is a very worrisome sign.
In the lead up to the world championship, the authorities need to urgently figure out how to accommodate all the city's guests.
Rosbalt's informants believe that apartment rents will rise by 10-30% as a result of the tournament, and, even after the championship, it will be necessary to pay through the nose for rented accommodations.
The world championship in football has forced the authorities to take a look at the state of Russian hotels.
According to a law specifically written for the championship, every hotel in Saint Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that they meet their alleged star rating and level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will manage to do this: hoteliers are so apprehensive about the screening process that they frequently aren't even submitting request documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Saint Petersburg.
Head of the Office of the Federal Antimonopoly Service, Vadim Vladimirov, says that the agency has investigated 138 hotels and now plans on initiating 34 cases against hotels, many of which have simply not responded to FAS staff.
There are signs that the management of thirty companies were deceiving city residents by alleging a certain number of stars in advertisements, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now, ahead of 2018, literally not even one room from the overall total can be lost.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will occupy all of Saint Petersburg's hotels.
Currently, tourists can depend on 30,500 rooms in the city.
According to data from the Smolny Institute, there are 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two and three-star hotels, and 550 one-star hotels in Saint Petersburg.
According to First Deputy of the Committee for the Development of Tourism, Nana Gvichiya, at the present moment, only 23 hotels have undergone classification: this is the number of inspections that have been conducted by the companies accredited in Saint Petersburg.
However, the Smolny Institute, for a surprising set of circumstances, doesn't know whether or not some hotels could have ordered a similar procedure from regional businesses.
In other words, there may be more hotels that have undergone classification, but no one knows about it.
"Over the past six months, hotels have not been very interested in undergoing classification", admitted the Director of the Northwestern branch of the Russian Tourism Industry Union, Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is explained by it being peak season, the time when hoteliers make the most money and don't want to be dealing with other issues.
Another reason is their budgets, which didn't include expenses for inspections, especially since the procedure could cost a hotel, depending on its status, between 30 thousand to 100 thousand roubles or more.
However, more recently, hotel managers have woken up and started to apply for classification, assured Shadskaya.
Hotels must get this done by July 1, 2016; otherwise, they will not only have to pay a fine, but also will not receive the right to operate during the world championship.
It is already well known that, based on star ratings, a set rate per hotel room for the duration of the tournament will be developed.
The formulas, according to which prices will be set, will be published next year.
This is done to ensure that there isn't a 200-300% spike in prices, as happens, for example, during the Saint Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience and prevent a two-threefold price hike, while also enabling hotels to make money.
"I think there will be a 50% increase", explained President of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.
Whereas Vadim Vladimirov isn't convinced that fixing prices corresponds with the notion of a free market economy.
I don't know how well it fits within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better than rampant price increases", he noted.
It's not clear what will happen with popular inexpensive hostels.
State Duma deputies have introduced a bill that would prohibit hostels in residential buildings.
We really hope that this law is not adopted or that it won't apply to Saint Petersburg.
"We will defend our point of view, that hostels should be maintained", says Nana Gvachiya.
However, according to her, owners of mini-hotels, should, in any case, be ready for a tightening of the Housing Code.
If the State Duma ends up approving the bill, then approximately 80% of the hostels in Saint Petersburg will be closed, and currently, they account for 1,500 rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers for the Northwest, Leonid Garbar, there aren't enough two and three-star hotels in Saint Petersburg, which are exactly what football fans are looking for, whereas there is an overabundance of four and five-star hotels.
This state of affairs is equivalent to a situation where "you have 75 thousand VIPs in an 80-thousand-person stadium".
In fact, making use of mini-hotels can solve this issue.
The expert considers their possible ban to be "idiocy": "I find it strange that some people can live in apartments, but out-of-towners, for some reason, cannot".
If a hostel is being used like a dormitory, then I agree that this is not right.
But if it is being used like a hotel, where guests stay for a short period of time, then why not?
Mini-hotels also risk missing out during the world championship in football as a result of their own foot-dragging.
Hundreds of small hotels will simply not manage to undergo classification in time, what's more is that they are digging their own hole.
By the summer of 2016, all the city's hotels will be booking inspections.
"There aren't that many companies that are allowed to carry out this procedure, and, as such, they will turn down the less profitable orders from mini-hotels and will choose those that are more expensive", noted Gennady Lamshin, adding that, in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the figure for those that have already completed inspections is currently much higher than for those in Saint Petersburg.
The reason for Saint Petersburg's delay is related in part to constant changes in the government's tourism unit, which has not be conducive to coordinated efforts.
According to experts, if there aren't enough hotels in Saint Petersburg for everyone, then, most likely, attention will have to be shifted towards regional hotels and health resorts.
Just as during the celebration of Saint Petersburg's 300th anniversary, a river fleet could be mobilised, which would enable tournament guests to stay in ship cabins.
Besides, many fans have arranged to arrive in vans, in which they could spend the night.
"The main thing is to not build so many hotels, that they later end up sitting empty", assured Gennady Lamshin.
Rented accommodations will also be very popular during the football championship.
A pool of apartments available for rent in the city will most likely be created.
Rental rates will rise by 10-30%.
"Obviously, the first to go will be housing near the stadium", noted rent specialist for the Agency for the Development and Study of Real Estate, Larisa Bragina.
Moreover, rent prices might not return to previous levels after the championship, especially in commuter communities.
This will also contribute to the construction of new traffic interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she underscored.
One shouldn't forget about the human qualities of city residents.
For example, Leonid Garbar insists that Saint Petersburg has always been a welcoming city, where people not only provide you with directions, but might also take you on a mini-excursion.
There can also be complications.
Sometime around 1970, my father met a family from Murmansk in the courtyard: a father, mother, and two children.
It turned out they had nowhere to spend the night: getting a hotel was difficult back then and sleeping at the train station was tough.
"So my father let them into our communal apartment to sleep", our interviewee recalled.
Of course, he added that, nowadays, this type of trait no longer exists amongst the city's residents - inviting someone into your home is fraught with consequences and frightening.
But, perhaps, in 2018, after the ill-fated decisions of the State Duma, and the mistakes of hoteliers and the government, we might be required to recall the past?
