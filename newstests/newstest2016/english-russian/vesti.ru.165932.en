Derbent: a living link with time.
Derbent is one of the most ancient cities in Russia; in September, it celebrates its 2000th anniversary.
The programme of celebratory events includes: a festival of the ethnic cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of times past; an exhibition of Derbent carpets and an open-house day at places of worship; a historical-musical show, "2000 years in one hour", and tours of the renovated Peter I Museum.
The medieval stone Naryn-Kala fortress, old Arabic inscriptions on walls, narrow streets, and palace gardens: all of it appears as if from the pages of "One thousand and one nights".
Derbent is the only Russian city that has survived in the same place since antiquity.
Even though it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Khaganate, and the Golden Horde.
The age of the oriental planes that grow in the courtyard of Derbent's Juma mosque equals several centuries.
These massive plants are protected under the All-Russia "Trees are the monuments of living nature" programme.
The shade of the spreading crown saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
A visitor to the mosque is poured aromatic tea and offered Dagestani delicacies: honey fig, persimmon, medlar, miracle flatbread, ayran, and sweets.
Large samovars have been used in Derbent since the dawn of time so that tea can be served to many guests at one time.
The inscription at the entrance to the Juma mosque says that the building was constructed in the 115th year of the Hijra.
That is, in the year 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the most ancient mosque in Russia.
The interior dazzles in terms of scale and solemnity: the arcades of domes and arches rest on square columns and are lit by sunlight streaming through miniature windows.
Keeping and breeding doves is a traditional pastime for residents of Derbent.
Owners of these domesticated birds place dovecotes in courtyards, under trees, and in attics.
It's a spectacular sight to see a flock of white doves take off into the sky, looking like a flash of festive fireworks.
In order to defend against the ancient Persian enemies, the Caspian gates were blocked off by twin stone walls.
Jutting out 500 metres into the sea, this construction enclosed Derbent's harbour.
In 2003, Derbent's fortress walls were included on UNESCO's world heritage list as the best-preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets were woven in Derbent as far back as in the fifth century, and the technique for this unique craft has remained almost unchanged up to the present day.
Carpets to suit every taste are sold on one of the streets adjacent to the city market: carpets woven from wool, cotton, or felt, in every colour and shade, with long or short pile and complex designs and whimsical fringe.
Construction of the city began with magals: neighbourhoods of single-story stone buildings.
For many years, the magals remained virtually unchanged.
Only the satellite dishes, air conditioners on the walls, and streetlights serve as reminders that you are in a modern and not a medieval city.
In the old part of the city, parts of the aqueduct, built by the Persians approximately a thousand years ago, are preserved.
Ancient springs, from which local residents still collect water, survive to the present day.
Many residents of Derbent prefer the water from the trusted historical fountains to regular tap water.
Derbent was one of the centres of the pottery trade.
Glazed and painted vases, dishes, pitchers, and cups were prized throughout the Caucasus.
Even today, potters' hands produce marvellous ceramic works for both everyday use and as souvenirs.
During holiday and festival days, crowds of spectators gather under a tightrope, where students from the Republican School of Circus Arts perform.
The history of this amazing and risky artform dates back several centuries.
A new trend is seeing increasingly more girls amongst the tightrope walkers.
Today, the Museum of Culture and Everyday Life of Ancient Derbent operates at the location of the former Maiden's Bathhouse.
Previously, this is where unmarried and betrothed young women would wash themselves in the company of their girlfriends, but now, anyone who wants to can see the vaulted domed hall, hot and cold pools, and bathing tools from times past.
The majority of Derbent's homes have hot water, but bathhouses and steam rooms are just as popular today as they were in the old days.
The benefit of warming the body with steam was written about in ancient books.
After using the bathhouse, the blood is improved, the muscles no longer feel tired, and the body gains flexibility and a sense of lightness.
Ethnic households from many areas of Dagestan participate in the Fellowship Festival, which is held at the Naryn-Kala fortress.
Participants in ethnic costumes dance, play folk music, perform songs of the peoples of the Caucasus, and treat visitors to delicious homemade cheese.
Kyrkhlyar is the burial site of forty martyrs who laid down their lives for Islam.
It is one of the most revered sites for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
The sarcophagi, yellowed by time and carved from solid stone blocks, are oriented on a west-east axis, as is the Arab custom.
Brothers, Gavril and Albert Yakubov, cut hair and shave clients in a small shop near the Upper Bazaar.
The barbershop has been operating at this site for many years.
The tricks of the barber trade are passed down from generation to generation.
Moreover, the Yakubov brothers can do not only traditional, but also the most modern hairstyles.
On one of the streets of the Old City, a house where exiled Decembrist writer, Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, lived, has been preserved.
Having learned Turkish and collected ethnographic materials, he described Derbent in the first third of the 19th century, with its ancient monuments and the everyday life of its citizens.
The teahouse is a traditional meeting place in the East, where only tea and home-baked goods are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, converse with friends, and resolve business issues.
As in the past, it is not recommended that women cross the threshold of a teahouse.
Derbent's dance troupe, Caspian, was founded three years ago, but it has already managed to participate in events at the republican and national level.
The troupe's principal performers rehearse every day, perfecting Avar, Dargin, Tat, and Armenian folk dances.
At nightfall, when the noise fades away and the streetlights come on, local residents settle onto benches outside of their homes with protruding terraces.
Usually, Derbent residents discuss everyday issues.
But in the lead-up to the anniversary, they increasingly recall episodes from the unique history of their city, which has influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea and Caspian region.
