Yezhov hopes to make it into SKA's starting line-up in the match against Slovan.
SKA goaltender, Ilya Yezhov, stressed that he hoped to make it into the Red Army team's starting line-up in the next match of the KHL Championship.
Yezhov replaced Mikko Koskinen on the ice at the 23-minute mark with a score of 0-3 and deflected every shot on his goal; SKA let in the fourth goal after the goalie was pulled for a sixth player.
The team's next match is on the road against Slovan.
I hope that in the next match I will be in the starting line-up, R-Sport quotes Yezhov as saying.
I'm not an expert on goalies: I'm a goalie myself; they don't show us the replays of conceded goals, and so it's difficult to keep track.
Dynamo played well and everyone has bad games.
The team still lost.
It would have been better if I had let in more goals, but the team had won.
