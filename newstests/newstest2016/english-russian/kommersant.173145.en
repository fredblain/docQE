The possibility of a meeting between parliamentarians from Ukraine and Russia is reported at the OSCE PA.
Head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Artur Gerasimov, reported the possibility of a bilateral meeting with their Russian counterparts in parliament this year to discuss the situation in Southeast Ukraine.
"What I know is that a specific meeting is being planned this year, possibly between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations", TASS reports Mr. Gerasimov as saying.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreement and "a return to normal life in our countries".
On the issue of whether or not, in his opinion, a dialogue at the parliamentary level between Ukraine and Russia was possible at the present time, either in the "Normandy format" or in the format of a contact group under the auspices of the OSCE PA, Mr. Gerasimov remarked that a dialogue has been held: there is a Minsk agreement.
At the same time, according to the politician, there is support in Kiev for any form of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative for Ukraine at the negotiations, the country's former President, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lukhansk essentially have still not changed their positions on tripartite negotiations, but that the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
