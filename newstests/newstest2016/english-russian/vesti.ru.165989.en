The Green Tribunal turns out to be quick to judge.
A typical situation: four officials stand in front of Judge Swatanter Kumar's bench while listening to his complaints about work done.
The court is entirely unsatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't provide you with a 110-page order for you to make a mockery of it, says Kumar.
If even just one more brick is put up, we will order that every existing building site be demolished.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NGT), a judicial authority established in 2010, in order to stop the rapid pollution of the environment that has accompanied the explosive economic growth of the past decades.
Since that time, the Tribunal has managed to hear more than 10 thousand cases related to air pollution, waste collection, geological developments, hazardous waste, and the construction of dikes.
In two out of three cases, the court rules to halt construction that is causing pollution.
The stakes are unbelievable high: in the not quite 60 years that have passed since the declaration of independence, intensified industrial development has turned India from a country of unadulterated jungles into one of the most over-populated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is especially acute in large metropolitan areas where the development of infrastructure is lagging behind rapid urbanisation: cities are blanketed by thick smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and industrial and household waste, and the few remaining residential areas are being razed to build new residential neighbourhoods.
Despite the government's formal support of the green movement, the NGT is regularly criticised by Narendra Modi's government, since it is frequently the main cause for the cancellation of large investment projects.
For example, in May of this year, the Minister of the Environment called the courts rulings "extreme" and "unenforceable".
Sometimes the court's decisions really are impossible to carry out within the judicially set timeframe, confirms Raj Panjwani, an environmental lawyer.
However, impossible deadlines have an upside: at least they force the responsible parties to get cracking.
"Its main purpose is to shake up this system", the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has already cancelled major projects on several occasions: construction of an airport, an electrical power station, and hundreds of other smaller facilities has been terminated on its account.
Furthermore, they also try not to forget about the people: for example, during deliberation on the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telangana that had polluted the local river with fluoride.
We could shutdown your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs", Kumar commented on his ruling.
However, similar explanations are by no means always met with understanding from ordinary people, whose lives could be changed by one stroke of the judicial pen.
For example, in April, the Tribunal issued a ruling to ban transport vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital, which caused a nation-wide outcry.
In spite of a steep decline in popularity and a barrage of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to reverse the ruling.
Instead, he requested statistics on inbound and outbound vehicular traffic from the Delhi government, and also submitted a proposal to purchase 10 thousand additional buses, after having checked in advance with the factories whether or not they were capable of filling such an order.
As sources of pollution like landfills, fuel quality, and even road incidents started to fall into the purview of the court, the people's wrath began to gradually dissipate.
But the most painful subject for the principled judge became the clean-up programme for the Ganges River, which was announced to great fanfare by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When talking about the Ganges, a river that is sacred to Hindus, the judge is often unable to restrain his emotions and will switch to shouting.
Do you know what the word "sacred" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges onto a statue of a god and it ended up covered in faecal matter, the judge states angrily.
You continue to pollute the river because you think: the Ganges is the Ganges and it washes away all of our sins.
This is the river that we worship, but just look at what you do to it every day.
The clean up of the Ganges is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the level of faecal bacteria in the river exceeds acceptable norms by more than 120 times.
Every year, anywhere between 1.5 and 3 million of the 700 million Hindus that bathe in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated the money received from the sale of the outfit he wore when he met Barack Obama, as well as 455 other items from his personal collection, to the Save the Ganges Foundation.
Environmentalists immediately accused the Prime Minister of populism: the outfit was purchased for 700 thousand dollars, while the clean up of the river requires at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country; nevertheless, they don't believe that the environment should be the cost of progress.
"Conversations about the environment in a developing country are often perceived as being an unaffordable luxury, says an activist for the Ganga Ahvaan organisation, Mallika Bhanot.
But the court is trying to find a middle ground between the environment and development".
