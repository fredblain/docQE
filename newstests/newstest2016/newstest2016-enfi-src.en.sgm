<seg id="4">According to police situation centre, the boy has been contacted and there is no danger to his life or health.</seg>
<seg id="5">Around midnight, the father of the boy informed Ilta-Sanomat that the boy has been found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ronaldo’s fantastic game - increases goal difference to Messi</seg>
<seg id="2">Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in La Liga this weekend and continued scoring also in the Champions League.</seg>
<seg id="3">The competition between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal scoring record is, at least for the moment, tipping the scales in favour of the latter.</seg>
<seg id="4">Real Madrid’s Ronaldo moved clear on his own at the top of the all-time scoring charts, after scoring twice from spot-kicks and once from a game situation against guest team Shakhtar Donetsk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ronaldo increased his goal scores to 80, when before Tuesday he was level with Barcelona’s Messi on 77 goals.</seg>
<seg id="6">Real won the match 4-0.</seg>
<seg id="7">Early this season, Juventus has struggled in the Italian football league, Seri A, but it had a strong start in the D Group of the Champions League as it won Manchester City 2-1 in an away game.</seg>
<seg id="8">The winning goal was scored about ten minutes before the end byt Juventus’ Alvaro Morata.</seg>
<seg id="9">City’s strikes were blunted because they were lacking Sergei Aguero, who has a knee injury.</seg>
<seg id="10">Aguero picked up an injury in the weekend’s Premier League game, and did not make an appearance until the final ten minutes.</seg>
<seg id="11">The other Manchester team United also had a rough night in Holland, as they suffered a 1-2 defeat against PSV Eindhoven.</seg>
<seg id="12">ManU's 20-year-old back Luke Shaw’s away match only lasted for a quarter of an hour.</seg>
<seg id="13">PSV’s Hector Moreno’s dangerous-looking lunge hit the ManU back so badly that Shaw probably broke his shin bone.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shaw lay on the Eindhoven home stadium turf for about ten minutes, before the medical personnel took him to the hospital to be treated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Memphis Depay scored 1-0 for the guests on the 41st minute, but ManU’s joy lasted only a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Moreno squared the game on overtime before the break.</seg>
<seg id="17">PSV’s winning goal was scored by Luciano Narsingh on the second half-time.</seg>
<seg id="18">This season’s Champions League scoring was opened by Paris Saint-Germain in the A Group.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Argentinian who changed Manchester United’s shirt to PSG’s jersey, Angel Di Maria, was to be thanked for the goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Di Maria burst down the right and steered the ball into the far corner past Malmö’s goalie, Johan Wiland.</seg>
<seg id="21">Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG during the second half-time.</seg>
<seg id="22">PSG is mentioned among this season’s possible successes.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is not a wrong assumption, but Malmö, who is one of the small clubs in the League, is not the best possible point of comparison.</seg>
<seg id="24">PSG’s star striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, faced his original team, Malmö FF, for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="26">Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes, when his team, PFC CSKA Moscow lost 0-1 for Wolfsburg in a B Group match in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1">In 911 Call, Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend</seg>
<seg id="2">In a 911 call, his voice only slightly shaky, college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb made a point to say his "sweet dog" was there alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the home, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad: "I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the day, there would be one more death: Lamb took his own life as police closed in on him.</seg>
<seg id="9">A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="10">The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Students said they looked forward to his class.</seg>
<seg id="12">Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History, which lists 17 faculty members, and many students took courses from both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, there were some inclinations of problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and jittery, "like there was something wrong with him."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, saying he had a health issue of some sort.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year, he was only teaching two online classes.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recent changes in the university's hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor.</seg>
<seg id="21">University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."</seg>
<seg id="22">Those are questions Lamb can no longer answer.</seg>
<seg id="23">After fleeing the campus, police later picked up Lamb's trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he could be apprehended, Lamb killed himself with a single .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="25">His car was still running in the driveway.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home, though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in the area.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.</seg>
<seg id="29">He received a doctorate in education in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar.</seg>
<seg id="33">He was quite the heartthrob back then.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the girls would melt when he was around," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no record of them ever marrying.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog named Lightning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a bayou in Gautier.</seg>
<seg id="38">Police said the dog was OK.</seg>
<seg id="39">Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who's now 19.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She and her mother were absolutely best friends.</seg>
<seg id="42">O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">Later, they played together in the occasional gig.</seg>
<seg id="45">O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss the night of Sept. 5, after Lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmonica for a sparse crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">There was no sign of anything amiss.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We were cutting up and throwing one-liners at each other.</seg>
<seg id="51">I mean, they both had a good sense of wit about them.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, the slain professor, directed the first-year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three young children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.</seg>
<seg id="55">On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."</seg>
<seg id="57">Classes resume Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is over.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is a day of healing.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lamb made the 911 call after shooting Schmidt, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call, there is no indication the two ever married.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to label him a flip-flopper.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others have dismissed him as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some are holding out for an implosion.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's lead at double digits, and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.</seg>
<seg id="8">None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pundits point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump's staying power and beginning to unload their dollars to topple him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July, it was 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In early August, it was 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view.</seg>
<seg id="19">And these numbers hold up in early states.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next closest in enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number holds in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters are getting used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When they put on their pundit hats, Republican voters think Trump is for real.</seg>
<seg id="34">When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll out last week.</seg>
<seg id="35">That's a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time last cycle, four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination, vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still, it shows that a plurality of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some pundits point out that the splintered field is likely contributing to Trump's lead, while anti-Trump support is be spread diffusely among more than a dozen other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that, in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always garners majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.</seg>
<seg id="43">He's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head.</seg>
<seg id="46">A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new CBS/NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes.</seg>
<seg id="48">Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say they would never change their mind.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech two months ago, immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are worried that Trump's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will remain too.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration with government is climbing to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters, largely due to their outsider status.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six in 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are angry at Washington, too.</seg>
<seg id="60">A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "mad as hell."</seg>

<seg id="1">Jeremy Corbyn to make debut at Prime Minister's Questions</seg>
<seg id="2">Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been keenly awaited</seg>
<seg id="3">New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, taking on David Cameron for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday, with his performance likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.</seg>
<seg id="5">He has called for "less theatre and more facts" at the weekly showpiece.</seg>
<seg id="6">He has also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and did recognise the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "irrespective" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are also "stacking up" within Labour following Mr Corbyn's appointment over its position on the European Union and the government's cap on benefits.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £26,000 to £23,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the despatch box over the past decade since he became Tory leader.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Islington North MP has said PMQs is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "repartee" and trading barbs, instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will deputise for him at PMQs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted some years later that he had failed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since it was first televised in 1990, PMQs has been seen as a key barometer of a leader's judgement, their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caricature and is in need of far-reaching reforms.</seg>

<seg id="2">The pound jumped following data showing a pick-up in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher by bid target SABMiller.</seg>
<seg id="3">Between May and July, UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.9% compared with the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="4">The rate was the fastest since 2009, and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro at €1.3730.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% to 6,229.21.</seg>
<seg id="7">SABMiller was the stand-out stock on the market, jumping 20% after it received a bid approach from rival AB InBev.</seg>
<seg id="8">A deal would combine the world's two largest brewers, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.</seg>
<seg id="9">Burberry shares were 0.9% higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.</seg>
<seg id="10">Richemont's latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - had begun to grow again.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5bn through a share placement as part of its debt-cutting strategy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Shares in packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest fallers on the index, down 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the firm to "sell."</seg>

<seg id="2">Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from an Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grocery wholesaler Metcash has kicked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering taste testing at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the food, liquor and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual investor strategy day.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="8">South Australian and Western Australian shoppers are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snare around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Metcash's high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million in earnings before interest and tax, Mr Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, even though a recent Roy Morgan survey found IGA shoppers were most loyal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "highly, probably disappear within a decade.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Metcash's food and grocery business, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operating deleverage as sales and margins come under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million a year matching shelf prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers refurbish stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and rolling out a better range of private label groceries.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says the price matching and store refurbishment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholesaler will return to underlying profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves kudos rather than criticism for his own behaviour, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the "Special Ks," was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyrgios sledge of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the chair umpire, with Harrison declaring: "Wawrinka should've decked Kyrgios, and I should deck that kid."</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was last seen smashing a racquet after cramp foiled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis has been defended staunchly by Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second singles berth behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing I do feel quite keenly about is I think Thanasi's been dragged into the fray a little bit," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He did break a racquet when he lost when he cramped in the US, but he's not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of that.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he's handled himself extremely well, in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.</seg>
<seg id="11">He's a great team around him, he's got a great family around him and I just think he's been a little hard done by.</seg>
<seg id="12">He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in with the team and so on, he hasn't ever had an issue with the other players, he's well respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he's in great shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for the important tie, starting on Friday, describing the "mutual decision" as the right thing for all, but backing the Canberran to return as a long-term fixture in the team.</seg>
<seg id="14">"First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think Nick, he's risen very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he's growing up in the public eye and he's made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the limelight where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it's best for the team and it's best for him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Europe migrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency, seals border, detains migrants</seg>
<seg id="2">Declaring a state of emergency, Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally, aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.</seg>
<seg id="4">Stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries' checkpoints, those fleeing violence in their homelands pitched tents and settled in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But frustrations were on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a police helicopter hovered above, migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some refused food and water in protest.</seg>
<seg id="8">Serbia's foreign minister declared it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.</seg>
<seg id="9">(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.</seg>
<seg id="10">There will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120,000 more refugees, including some from Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hungary, however, was not pinning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a razor-wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were enlisted in the race to finish the razor wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for migrants, many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations, including Germany.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) razor-wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of crisis," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We are very clear on this: Illegal border crossing is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the military, expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gyorgy Bakondi, homeland security adviser to Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">They got across by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deploying a train car covered with razor wire to close one of them.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chaos enveloped the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside.</seg>
<seg id="29">About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national poll</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second, with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the primary contests, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since last month's CBS News Poll, Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now even.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Clinton still has a large lead with older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point edge with this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support her.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her.</seg>
<seg id="17">Views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton, fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the nominee, the top answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by it's time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).</seg>
<seg id="21">Agreement on the issues, and electability are also cited.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the vice president weighs a potential run for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don't think he should.</seg>
<seg id="23">When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the top pick.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders widens, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is a distant second on this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the most electable has risen.</seg>
<seg id="28">Still, when asked which is more important in a nominee, Democratic voters pick issues over electability.</seg>
<seg id="29">Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, perform well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden does the best of the three on honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him on this.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as in line with their views ideologically.</seg>
<seg id="35">On all of these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">As questions continue about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn't impacted their overall views of her.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it's a different story among the American public overall.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while just about a third are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">The public's views on this were split back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is mainly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think of her as honest and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush do the best on honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">More see Sanders as honest than not, but like Carson, many don't have an opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump in the newest CBS News/New York Times poll</seg>
<seg id="3">The two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll, leaving others scrounging for a foothold</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican voters nationwide continue to back Trump in large numbers, climbing from 23% support in the last CBS poll, conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in the poll out Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Carson rocketed in that same period from 6% to 23%.</seg>
<seg id="6">The survey also found Carson doing well across demographic groups, edging out Trump among college-educated Republican voters.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, has slipped behind with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling farthest from 10% support last month to 2% now.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio all tied for third place with 6%.</seg>
<seg id="9">The margin of error for the 376-person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus-or-minus 6%, and was conducted Sept.</seg>
<seg id="10">The latest CNN/ORC survey, released last week, showed Carson rising in the polls -- landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump's 32% support.</seg>
<seg id="11">The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.</seg>
<seg id="12">Facing a rising Carson last week, Trump took some potshots at the retired neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman</seg>
<seg id="2">Nearly two years after a college student died during a fraternity hazing ritual in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, murder charges have been filed against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of New York City's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation rite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said he was blindfolded, saddled with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president to seek advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, members began to hide paraphernalia and basically put the fraternity's well-being over that of Michael Deng's," Chief Wagner said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He could not be revived and he died the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to an autopsy report, Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head, torso, and thighs.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternity hazing, with at least one student dying every year from hazing since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng's family, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is an important one.</seg>
<seg id="13">A Monroe County grand jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We want to hold not only the individuals involved, but if there's an organization that sanctioned it, whether officially or unofficially, we're going to hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity revoked its affiliation with the local chapter.</seg>

<seg id="1">Here's what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">A rate hike will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">This we know.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we don't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the economy specifically, history offers little guide about timing.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are, indeed, multiple variables at play.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, however, market participants may find that all the rate-hike fuss may have been overdone.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of 'cheap money,' " Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">That's not to say there won't be effects, however.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's a look at how some areas of the economy could react, based on historical trends:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen over the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">Once the hike hits, though, the impact is not as dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-24 months after the first hike, which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">More specifically, the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent) then back to normal once 500 days have passed, with average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, posted on Barron's.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate-hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help them along.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could hasten a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Most notably, gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, few expect that to last, with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hiking rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants have been bracing for a Fed hike all year, with all eyes turned toward this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at this meeting, futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study since 1950, all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP eclipsing prerecession peaks very quickly post the recovery commencing," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="29">By contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and this is 74 months and counting.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience.</seg>
<seg id="32">The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy.</seg>
<seg id="33">For bonds, it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike/cut in the cycle arrives.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Charles Schwab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between longer- and shorter-dated bonds to move closer together, flattening the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about stretching for yield," Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interestingly, Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Broadly speaking, companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinationals with lots of debt will fare worse, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to outperform during the three months following an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.</seg>
<seg id="43">Firms with strong balance sheets outpaced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994, 1999, and 2004 rate hikes, by an average of 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also outperformed their lower quality counterparts, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt will become a big issue.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside pure stock plays, consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see gains as well through higher yields at the, though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says MP Andrew Bingham</seg>
<seg id="2">Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised station for 'dumbing down'</seg>
<seg id="3">Argues it's becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rival</seg>
<seg id="4">Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they just rip off the Brits</seg>
<seg id="5">Colleague Damien Collins MP attacked The Voice, saying that too wasn't original</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a leading MP has claimed, piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not.</seg>
<seg id="7">Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbing down" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "dumbing down" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Brits by another name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So, if you're trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you're actually just mimicking what is already on the market," Mr Bingham said.</seg>
<seg id="12">BBC director general denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public.</seg>
<seg id="13">What I learn from Radio 3, I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it's commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none.</seg>
<seg id="15">"And also, Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past, because Britons are less educated about classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's output which came under fire for treading on the toes of commercial rivals, during the Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a particularly BBC way."</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from our own in-house stable" next time it launches an entertainment series.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future, or spending licence fee payers' money on other entertainment formats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Internet sales increased at slowest ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame</seg>
<seg id="2">First three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales</seg>
<seg id="3">Last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000</seg>
<seg id="4">Online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe November's Black Friday could be holding back spending</seg>
<seg id="6">For over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain's high streets into ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="7">But experts say there are now signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with just a five per cent rise on last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts say there are signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015</seg>
<seg id="10">'If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000, it was always going to rationalise over time,' Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="11">He explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.</seg>
<seg id="12">It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts, such as on the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="13">But now that is plateauing a bit, you might see (growth) fall away.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Black Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales.</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November .</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to snap up deals crashing a number of retailers websites.</seg>
<seg id="17">Experts believe Black Friday, which saw shoppers fight over bargains, could be holding shoppers off from making purchases</seg>
<seg id="18">Research published by the British Retail Consortium found just over £1 in every £5 was being spent online.</seg>
<seg id="19">For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online, rather than using high street fashion chains.</seg>

<seg id="2">Bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first funerals take place in Mecca</seg>
<seg id="3">Come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group</seg>
<seg id="4">The Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed down</seg>
<seg id="5">Carried aloft through the streets, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand mosque.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dressed largely in white, mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="7">The sad possession passed by the holy site, where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto worshipers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.</seg>
<seg id="9">The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="12">Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj to Mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to descend on the city.</seg>
<seg id="13">Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it was not in use.</seg>
<seg id="14">An Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.</seg>
<seg id="15">The news agency's English service did not report that detail, but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to topple into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have converged ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month.</seg>
<seg id="17">Binladin Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment.</seg>
<seg id="18">The royal decree also blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteorological officials.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque, part of the massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and runs major building projects.</seg>
<seg id="21">Al Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son disowned by the family in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="22">The crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every able-bodied Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="23">Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="24">Officials ordered one million riyals (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed, and the same amount to those permanently injured.</seg>
<seg id="25">Others injured will receive half that amount.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britons are increasingly employing handymen says Veronique Laury</seg>
<seg id="3">Number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe behind rise</seg>
<seg id="4">Resulting in 200 more Screwfix stores, aimed at tradesmen, opening</seg>
<seg id="5">At same time Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets across the country</seg>
<seg id="6">By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail</seg>
<seg id="7">Britons are said to be putting down their hammers and paintbrushes in favour of employing skilled Eastern European tradesmen to carry out work in their home</seg>
<seg id="8">If you are handy with a hammer or a whizz at painting walls, it seems you are in the minority these days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because Britons are increasingly employing handymen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.</seg>
<seg id="10">Veronique Laury, new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement chain, said a big rise in the number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices is behind the trend.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result, Kingfisher is planning to open 200 more Screwfix stores, which are aimed at tradesmen, while closing 60 B&Q outlets.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mrs Laury said she wants more women to be employed in B&Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex.</seg>
<seg id="13">Currently the majority of staff are men.</seg>
<seg id="14">She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mrs Laury said: "We still have a majority of men working in our stores.</seg>
<seg id="16">We need to move more towards a balance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women.</seg>
<seg id="18">Women play a big part in the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain's FTSE100 index of leading firms, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kingfisher is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women, including its chief executive and finance director.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.</seg>
<seg id="22">It has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kingfisher posted a fall in both half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of shutting stores.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a result of the trend Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores</seg>

<seg id="1">Triple-S government decided to resort to mandatory law in order to save the country’s economy.</seg>
<seg id="2">Subsequent visible effects were seen quite soon.</seg>
<seg id="3">SAK and other labour market organisations’ head started to ache immediately, and as a result, the country stands still on Friday thanks to employees massive demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="4">Many think that also common sense comes to a standstill then.</seg>
<seg id="5">The question is if it is worth going on a strike, when the things are already going badly.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some have even organised a resistance movement.</seg>
<seg id="7">Online over 50,000 people have announced that they will not take part in the demonstration but will go to work.</seg>
<seg id="8">During the good old consensus times, this would have been impossible.</seg>
<seg id="9">Of course there was no internet where one could protest, but openly proclaiming to be a strike-breaker would have been a political suicide for an ordinary person.</seg>
<seg id="10">This protest of a few tens of thousands of people is of little concern to trade unions with millions of members, but it will give them something to think about.</seg>
<seg id="11">The position of labour movement is not as axiomatic as it still was two decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not everyone can identify with the goals of the movement, the values have changed</seg>
<seg id="13">From the point of view of the labour movement’s appeal, the government’s harsh solutions can also be seen as an absolute heaven-sent.</seg>
<seg id="14">After things have seemed to be driven by their own momentum for years, finally the unions can get down to business: to protect the rights of an employee, explicitly and properly.</seg>
<seg id="15">This way the government may unintentionally strengthen the role of the labour movement, as membership in a trade union can be perhaps seen as more necessary than before.</seg>
<seg id="16">Whatever the opinion on the organisers’ actions, the idea that the demonstration on Friday would somehow stop Finland is nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finland has stopped already some time ago.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, industrial production has been declining for 31 consecutive months.</seg>
<seg id="19">The GDP is still dropping and unemployment rising.</seg>
<seg id="20">You would think these things are a headache to everyone.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lappeenranta University of Technology will begin to implement savings measures, with a goal to cut costs for a total of 8.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="3">As part of the savings, the university begins employee cooperation negotiations that concern the whole staff, with an annual savings goal of 6.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="4">In practice, this means that there is a need to cut about 130 employees.</seg>
<seg id="5">In addition, the goal is to save 2 million from other activities.</seg>
<seg id="6">The background to the cooperation negotiations is the budget for 2016, which forecast a deficit of about 8.5 million to the actual operations.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government’s cuts also have an effect.</seg>
<seg id="8">During this financial year, the university will make a deficit of about 2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">For next year, the costs will go slightly up, but at the same time the financing from the ministry will be cut by 2 million and other financing by 3.2 million.</seg>
<seg id="10">The total budget of the university is about 85 million euros, so that means the savings goal is ten per cent of the total budget.</seg>
<seg id="11">The massive cuts targeted at teaching and research as well as the reduction of corporate financing have a significant joint effect on our university, states rector Anneli Pauli in the university press release.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before the summer the effects of the cuts seemed more moderated, but now the reduction of additional financing is shown in new proportions.</seg>
<seg id="13">The discussions with the employee’s representatives will begin on Tuesday next week and they will last six weeks as provided in the law.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday, to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it, now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-0.25 percent range.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>

<seg id="2">After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he "could take it back," authorities revealed Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police in Gautier, Miss. said Lamb, a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="4">Monday and said he had shot and killed someone.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send officers over to his home.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that is "not going to bother anyone" but is likely upset.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting.</seg>
<seg id="9">When police got to the scene they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, that said: "I am so sorry I wish I could take it back.</seg>
<seg id="10">I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me.</seg>
<seg id="11">After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cops closed in.</seg>
<seg id="12">University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "love triangle."</seg>
<seg id="14">Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends."</seg>
<seg id="18">Prentiss worked an online job from her home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified as a close friend of Prentiss by the Sun Herald.</seg>
<seg id="19">Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hound dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.</seg>
<seg id="20">"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Police said Lamb had phoned relatives at some point Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."</seg>
<seg id="22">When cops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over, bailed out on foot, ran into the woods and shot and killed himself.</seg>
<seg id="23">Lamb received a doctorate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to his resume posted on the university's website.</seg>

<seg id="3">While this left the full-back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains hopeful Shaw could play again this season.</seg>
<seg id="4">The injury was caused by a reckless tackle from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had burst into the PSV area.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required oxygen before being taken to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."</seg>
<seg id="7">He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is awful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very difficult and then plays fantastically and then this happens.</seg>
<seg id="9">When it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.</seg>

<seg id="1">Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better than this?</seg>
<seg id="2">It's one thing any parent soon learns: when your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unless, it seems, you are David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">Asked by a provider of holiday childcare schemes to name his favourite kids' book, the prime minister opted for The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr Seuss.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the SuperCamps company, continuing: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed."</seg>
<seg id="6">All very well, except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a précis of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Set in the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," it reads, chronicling a love interest unknown to Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="8">If that wasn't suspicious enough, Cameron's submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lorax film provided on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey."</seg>
<seg id="9">Given he is an avowedly hands-on parent, it seems unlikely Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book's plot, in which a young unnamed boy hears how the local environment was devastated by the avaricious, tree-chopping, thneed-knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squat, moustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, such a relatively lowly PR task would have been outsourced to an aide, seemingly one who has never read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron's constituency office.</seg>
<seg id="12">SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron's staff, but had no further immediate comment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of England omission but it's still tough</seg>
<seg id="2">Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">I wouldn't rule out an away win, either.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that batting lineup and the collective mindset is strong; they will not carry scars from 2012, only a youthful positivity.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, represents an attacking option.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to omit Adam Lyth is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="8">His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on output.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors.</seg>
<seg id="10">A couple of half-centuries and Lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hopefully if he punches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me; he is a team man above all else.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth got seven caps - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the chance home and away.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only gripe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean first - when Lyth was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is an X-factor cricketer, which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit.</seg>
<seg id="19">He must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make-up of the side in the UAE.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea of Moeen opening the batting alongside Cook, which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four quicks, has been floated and it is not something I am against.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't see why a strokemaker cannot bat there and this left-hander has already shown he is one hell of a cricketer.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen may not have done the job for his county, Worcestershire, but he has been a No3 for them and there is not much difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">He peeled off three centuries immediately and did not look back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner and, in my limited dealings with him, he has struck me as very impressive young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People may look at his raw stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt but there are not a heap of spinners putting their hands up and selectors have opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn a lot on this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Away from the squad, England look to have made a couple of shrewd additions to their coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterstroke.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the game's loveliest blokes, who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it playing or coaching, and like Mahela has nous that can be tapped.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before, can freshen up a side.</seg>
<seg id="34">Colly's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes is rested for the one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this.</seg>
<seg id="35">While not everyone will agree, the coaches and selectors do not set the schedule.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you have to remember, like players, their jobs are dependent on results.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are never taken lightly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brexit camp might win the day if economy is in doldrums by 2017</seg>
<seg id="2">David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes, even without the election of genial Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the Labour leadership, or the TUC cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages too.</seg>
<seg id="4">A European diplomat chum explained the other day that, sunk in assorted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain's self-absorbed agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes which they mostly don't want.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Brighton for its annual bean, the TUC decided it didn't want them either if they eroded social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.</seg>
<seg id="7">PM and chancellor rock up to summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local grandee, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's all about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European pal, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.</seg>
<seg id="10">Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously level-headed chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her, as it did for overstayers Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).</seg>
<seg id="11">France's François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is a fading force too.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right, Spain one of the left.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Selfie Brits, whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks, SNP-style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the Brexit process, my pal suggests.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The renegotiation was a fix" and "Britain got nothing of value out of the renegotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Europeans know to their cost how predatory Fleet Street can be and how EU-sceptic the oligarch press barons are, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2:1.</seg>
<seg id="18">They may dimly remember Boris Johnson, the arch Euro-opportunist, making his name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.</seg>
<seg id="19">For all his foolishness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.</seg>
<seg id="20">They included the medley of tax-shy rascals, phone-hacking foreigners and pseudo non-doms who own most of our great newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them, but realised that when you're in a cage with a randy gorilla you have to pass the bananas to distract it from having you for lunch and again for tea.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposing Cameron's referendum wheeze, since Blair had conceded the principle over the EU's aborted constitution, sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get-out card.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press never forgave him that either.</seg>
<seg id="24">But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose BBC sofa he vacated on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says he'd like us to stay in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well, most people outside Ukip's woad-wearing tendency and the wilder shores of Tory little Englanderism can probably say yes to that.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 70s, when his old dad struggled on TV to be disloyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilary's struggle was more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But fighting to stay in "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever the bottom-up, touchy-feely image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and especially in the maelstrom that is social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It's fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles.</seg>
<seg id="37">As with his equivocation over Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that JC won't campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless?</seg>
<seg id="39">The US is already pretty disappointed with the Brits" feeble military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Tory government in power, as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarettes review</seg>
<seg id="2">Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers have said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE published the "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">But several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy foundation" on which PHE based its main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Writing in the BMJ, two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research paper.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also endorsed BAT's public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.</seg>
<seg id="14">The rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided, but they include several known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research paper produced by the group "tellingly concedes" there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been responded to before.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small by comparison, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2bn a year.</seg>
<seg id="26">By spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national remit.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 chief</seg>
<seg id="2">The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying its commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcasters.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals" biggest rating shows, and on channels such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie-up with the BBC without success.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you keep the licence fee, which I'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea, it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren't making and commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="8">They broadcast The Voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else would show that is a joke, it's ludicrous, it's obviously nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is one, EastEnders is another, admittedly made in-house.</seg>
<seg id="12">Frankly other channels would give their right arm for it.</seg>
<seg id="13">I struggle to see how it's public service broadcasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of people who work there, and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments about the BBC's most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as EastEnders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said the BBC's more niche public service programmes "go on to BBC4 where quite often you can't measure the audience but they fulfil their remit and they can argue when they go on their sanctimonious missions about justifying £4bn in licence fee income, "Well of course, we do all these obscure programmes that no one watched."</seg>
<seg id="18">They put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the best value from it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course you all think, we all think, £150 a year is great value, but for people for whom £150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don't consume a lot of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="22">He said little of the BBC's output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV output and 0.1% on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcasters in Australia and Canada and change it to "inform, enlighten and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said only a handful were shown on TV, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them all available to watch online.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Sonogenetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high-pitched for humans to hear.</seg>
<seg id="5">The pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light</seg>
<seg id="7">Researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure, dubbed sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves which then pass inside the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels, found in the membranes of some of the worms" cells.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to, according to a report in Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.</seg>
<seg id="14">When he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they switched on the modified motor neurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over that technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unlike light, which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that, using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make target human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="21">VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space on ExCeL's calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."</seg>
<seg id="22">They toyed with creating a more realistic dodgy corporate advert, but "by ramming it home with bright colours and animation, it was more arresting."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They've done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="24">What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.</seg>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors flog fantastically euphemistic products.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eight golden rules for living in student halls</seg>
<seg id="2">It's been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an oblivious 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moving into halls can range from mildly nerve-racking to totally terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, whether and where you took a gap year, where you stand on Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite because seriously guys it's just yeast extract HAHAHA I'll be in my room."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take a breath.</seg>
<seg id="7">And help others take one too - ask questions and show interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">It steers the conversation and helps you to scout out the people you like versus those you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were dispensing extinguishers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Give people space.</seg>
<seg id="10">People's rooms often morph into drinks receptions, movie-night venues and communal hangout spots, but they're also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear.</seg>
<seg id="11">Related: Don't even think about starting university in a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">Introverts get a raw deal at university.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a retreat, yet many halls form an inter-room-strolling culture that's friendly, social and conducive to lifelong friendships.</seg>
<seg id="14">That can be hell for someone who's trying to recharge.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I've expended on interacting with you."</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socialising - and maybe text instead of knocking.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking of knocking: do it.</seg>
<seg id="18">One guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn't locked he was invited in.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw some things.</seg>
<seg id="20">Make friends through baking.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since you're starting uni at the height of Bake-Off mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies seems marginally less weird, less 1950s "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I baked you something, now smile as I ask you personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="22">Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.</seg>
<seg id="23">Your housemates will feel obliged to chat, and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Obviously this is subject to you being a decent baker.</seg>
<seg id="25">Poorly-fused lumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stealing food is a common crime in student halls.</seg>
<seg id="27">Obviously nicking someones chicken is theft, but is taking a drop of milk for your tea stealing?</seg>
<seg id="28">Double check with the milk owner.</seg>
<seg id="29">Chances are they'll tell you to help yourself even if they're seething inside.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it more maturely than my hallmate, who tainted her milk with washing-up liquid to punish those who stole it.</seg>
<seg id="31">She's in jail now.</seg>
<seg id="32">You shouldn't make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying.</seg>
<seg id="33">This isn't just to be a decent human, but because you are the proverbial people in glass houses.</seg>
<seg id="34">A girl on my corridor asked her neighbour if they wouldn't mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="35">They responded by turning it up.</seg>
<seg id="36">When they finally shut up at 5am, she kindly let them sleep for two hours before blasting her own music, locking her door as she left for her three-hour exam.</seg>
<seg id="37">Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same hall as you?</seg>
<seg id="38">Conversely, wouldn't it be knuckle-bitingly awkward if you mistook a hallmate for your future spouse, hooked up, broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get custody of all your mutual friends?</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot hallmate is definitely not your future spouse, try to at least talk some sense into your groin.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the exhilarating moment you realise someone's left their keys inside their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is finer than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="41">A good prank is funny, but takes moments to reverse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Teach a valuable and amusing lesson about security by hiding something - but never trash someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lock their door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't Blu-Tack their possessions to the ceiling more than twice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Racist attack against foreign students’ residence in Kitee - House meant as a reception centre smeared in Salo</seg>
<seg id="2">On Saturday’s early hours a racist attack was made in a foreign students’ residence in Kitee, north Karelia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unlike the police had previously said, this was not an accommodation facility for underage asylum seekers, but a residence for foreign students that have been a bit longer in Finland, says a teacher of the Evangelical Folk High School of Kitee, Heidi Luukkainen.</seg>
<seg id="4">The windows and walls of the folk high school housing facility were smeared with racists signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown across one of the windows in the housing facility, states the Eastern Finland Police Department.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Luukkainen, who is the lead teacher of the folk high school’s social guarantee for young people training, there were about 10 people in the building during the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">“It was the weekend, and adults are free to move about, so some of them might have been elsewhere, too", says Luukkainen.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are people of 12 different nationalities accommodated in the folk high school.</seg>
<seg id="8">They include students, who have already been a while in Finland, and recently arrived underage asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="9">All the people inside the smeared building had an A-status.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Some of them study in an adult primary school, some pursue vocational studies and some study Finnish”, describes Luukkainen.</seg>
<seg id="11">A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner, who has already spent some time in Finland.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Eastern Finland Police Department investigates the attack as vandalism and disturbance of domestic peace.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Luukkainen, a briefing for students was organised on Monday, with the necessary interpreters present.</seg>
<seg id="14">“There is no panic, and nobody has wanted to leave.</seg>
<seg id="15">We have had foreign students for almost twenty years, and this is the first time something like this happens”, says Luukkainen.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Luukkainen, the smears have already been cleaned from the walls.</seg>
<seg id="17">At least three men are suspected in connection to the incident and they were driving a light-coloured passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="18">“I think this is just a young people’s whim for a weekend night, since this topic has been on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">Nothing more serious”, says Luukkainen.</seg>
<seg id="20">Also in Salo a hospital meant to be turned into a reception centre was smeared.</seg>
<seg id="21">The incident took place last week.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was reported by MTV on its website oon Tuesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="23">A swastika was drawn on the hospital wall, with English words “You are not welcome” written underneath.</seg>
<seg id="24">The offense has been reported to the police.</seg>
<seg id="25">Correction 15.9. At 16.02. Police's false information about the status and age of the people living in the target building were corrected.</seg>

<seg id="1">The state stops the Y-train service to Karjaa - passengers resent this, “completely idiotic”</seg>
<seg id="2">The Y-train service from Helsinki to Raasepori’s Karjaa will come to a halt in March.</seg>
<seg id="3">At Helsinki main railway station, many passengers in the early evening train of the said service resented the news.</seg>
<seg id="4">This service halt will especially impact people from Siuntio, says a resident Torbjörn Bengstöm.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is completely idiotic, since the population keeps on growing, and working people need a fast and flexible connection to Helsinki.</seg>
<seg id="6">This cannot result from anything else but political will - or lack of it.</seg>
<seg id="7">On HSTV interview video, Bengstöm promises to ride a tractor to the capital if needed.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are changes in trains also elsewhere in Uusimaa.</seg>
<seg id="9">The H and R services that use the main line will be connected to a new R-line.</seg>
<seg id="10">Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will be closed.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communication together with VR published information about the routes the Ministry is going to purchase train traffic services from in the next contract period.</seg>
<seg id="12">The contract period changes at the turn of the year, with closed routes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="13">The new four-year contract will be finalised in the autumn, and later approved by the appropriations committee.</seg>
<seg id="14">Siuntio resident Bengström sees the state's train cuts as short-sighted solution.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are making the same mistakes again they have done before, repeating them most systematically.</seg>
<seg id="16">Then follows the regret.</seg>
<seg id="17">Y-train is used also other people besides Raasepori and Siuntio residents, since it is fast and does not stop at every station.</seg>
<seg id="18">Anniina Pöyry from Espoo feels bad for those that have to travel farther from the city area.</seg>
<seg id="19">“It is especially unfortunate for those, who have to replan their journeys”, she said while climbing aboard the Y-train.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some relief is coming.</seg>
<seg id="21">There will probably be a new train for coastal line to replace the Y-train in Helsinki Regional Transport Authority’s (HSL) area, that is, to go as far as Kirkkonummi.</seg>
<seg id="22">This will mean more costs for HSL, or in practice for the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.</seg>
<seg id="23">“We will now begin to look into different options and their effects on the service level and ticket prices”, said the CEO of HSL, Suvi Rihtniemi.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is impossible to yet precisely estimate the costs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Rihtniemi says that based ot the number of passengers, Y-train has cost about a million a year for HSL, but naturally much more to the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="26">The prospective main line R-train will skip two stations.</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead the number of trains in Ainola and Saunakallio will double.</seg>
<seg id="28">A total of 28 small stations and a number of routes will stop across the country.</seg>
<seg id="29">The ministry will stop buying train traffic services from the Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki routes.</seg>
<seg id="30">Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to a Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.</seg>
<seg id="31">Trains will be reduced on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.</seg>
<seg id="32">There are over half a million journeys a year made on the reduced trains, as the total number of journeys in the traffic services purchased by the ministry is about nine millions.</seg>
<seg id="33">The new contract is meant to save the state 12.3 million euros annually.</seg>
<seg id="34">The annual contract value is about 27.5 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter for the book Pääoman ajankohtaisuus (the topicality of Capital): “Marx is worth reading up on”</seg>
<seg id="2">The crises in the world economy have resurfaced Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his magnum opus, Capital, published between 1867 and 1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the Communist Party of Finland (SKP), in the book published today, Marxin Pääoman ajankohtaisuus (the topicality of Marx’s Capital).</seg>
<seg id="3">“He is being taken more seriously now than in a long time”, Hakanen writes in his preface.</seg>
<seg id="4">Marx’s estimations about the development of capitalist economy, its globalisation and obtrusion even further to all aspects of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing importance of both monetary and imaginary capital have all been shown to be astonishingly visionary.</seg>
<seg id="5">The book that is based on Capital seminars organised by Hakanen also has a professor of Aalto University on its list of writers: esteemed economy expert Sixten Korkman.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the book Korkman says Marx is topical “now and forever”.</seg>
<seg id="7">But surely the former CEO of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy and the Centre for Finnish Business and Policy Studies is no Marxist?</seg>
<seg id="8">Well, no.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the telephone Korkman says that he does not think Marx is a topical economic thinker, but more an interesting social theorist.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nowadays social sciences have become differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and a literature connoisseur.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The common perception is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men”, begins Korkman.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is true that Marx's prophecies were wildly wrong.</seg>
<seg id="13">Even though Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he made too advanced deductions about the early stages of capitalism, contemplates Korkman.</seg>
<seg id="14">But Korkman also sees some value in Marx’s radical stance.</seg>
<seg id="15">“More relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions”, he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now there is again discussion about things like wealth distribution that was also an interest of Marx.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Marx can perhaps inspire someone, who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing because of a technical revolution”, analyses Korkman.</seg>
<seg id="18">But Marx will not help with tomorrow’s government decisions.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to him, capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be ceased.</seg>
<seg id="20">But Korkman still thinks Marx is worth reading up on.</seg>
<seg id="21">“It was impossible to read Marx in the 1970s”, says Korkman.</seg>
<seg id="22">“Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but they hated each other even more.”</seg>
<seg id="23">Now the discussion is more diverse, and it is possible to approach also Marx without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Every social scientist should read up on Marx’s ideologies - just like all the other classics, too”, says Korkman.</seg>

<seg id="3">The UN report on the civil war of 1983-2009 was unveiled on Wednesday after a long postponement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The report accuses both the security forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels, known as Tamil Tigers, of war crimes.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is estimated that at least 100,000 people died in the civil war.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no accurate information on the number of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="7">The UN report calls for proper investigation of especially the armed forces’ great assault during the last months of the long war in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report accuses the Sri Lankan security forces of torture, kidnappings and systematic sexual abuse targeted men as likely as women.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the report, the rebels are guilty of forcing outsiders and children to fight.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both sides have committed murders, states the report.</seg>

<seg id="1">Social media was weighed in the matriculation examination for English</seg>
<seg id="2">The Wednesday's test in this autumn's matriculation examination was advanced foreign language, which for most is English.</seg>
<seg id="3">There were over 16,000 candidates testing their skills in English.</seg>
<seg id="4">One topic for the essay part of the test was social media.</seg>
<seg id="5">The candidate was supposed to consider, based on their own experiences, whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.</seg>
<seg id="6">Another option was to write a text of 150-200 words addressed to a person writing an online advice column.</seg>
<seg id="7">The title was Dear Agony Aunt.</seg>
<seg id="8">Agony Aunt is equivalent to Finnish Leelian lepotuoli.</seg>
<seg id="9">She was the one to ask advice about how to make parents see things also from the point of view of the young people.</seg>
<seg id="10">There were altogether four topics, one of which had to be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="11">“This was the most difficult”, estimated Mia Lybeck, lecturer in English from Porvoo Swedish-speaking upper secondary school, about the third topic.</seg>
<seg id="12">The third topic only included a citation from the former President of the Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Lybeck, the fourth topic was quite nice.</seg>
<seg id="14">For that, the candidate had to write a spiel about why companies should hire young people to work for them.</seg>
<seg id="15">“At least in our school we have practised speech writing”, Lybeck says and estimates that the test was “quite normal”.</seg>
<seg id="16">The questions about texts contemplating for example the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change or handling large amounts of data could be answered in Finnish - or Swedish.</seg>
<seg id="17">There were also some who took part in tests for advanced Russian (168 candidates), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).</seg>
<seg id="18">The autumn matriculation exams continue on Friday, when the test in the second national language, Swedish or Finnish, is organised.</seg>
<seg id="19">The test is organised normally in upper secondary schools, so the employees’ demonstration has no effect on it.</seg>
<seg id="20">The matriculation examination board urges the candidates to find suitable traffic connections so that they arrive on time to the test.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is also possible to have extra time, if the candidate is able to prove that their tardiness was not caused by their own negligence.</seg>

<seg id="1">The police is preparing to receive tens of thousands of demonstrators in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland.</seg>
<seg id="2">The demonstration against the Government’s cut decisions will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, the police forecast.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to advance information, there can be even tens of thousands of people present.</seg>
<seg id="4">The members of SAK, Akava and STTK meet on Helsinki Railway Square at 11 o’clock.</seg>
<seg id="5">Also police officers are expected to take part in the demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those officers in duty are tasked with not only taking care of the emergencies and other police activities, but also securing the progress of the demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="7">The streets leading to Railway Square are closed from motorised vehicles between about 9.30-14.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.</seg>
<seg id="9">From Hakaniemi direction the traffic is cut off from Kaisaniemi roundabout, from western direction beginning from Mannerheimintie.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala, will Helsinki Police department have enough staff?</seg>
<seg id="11">For now it seems that we do.</seg>
<seg id="12">I do not take a stand on the police industrial action.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Kujala, support patrols from the rest of the country will come to Helsinki because of the demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="14">The police do not divulge precise patrol numbers.</seg>
<seg id="15">“There are some coming, but as a main rule, we can manage on our own”, Kujala says.</seg>
<seg id="16">The police urges people to avoid private car use in central Helsinki on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="17">Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jam stretches from Hakaniemi to the nuclear centre.</seg>
<seg id="18">Traffic standstills are to be expected from morning until the early evening.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are also many charter coaches arriving to Helsinki thanks to demonstrators from other parts of Finland.</seg>
<seg id="20">These will not be allowed in the Railway Square.</seg>
<seg id="21">In principle, the coaches terminate quite far.</seg>
<seg id="22">The rest of the journey to the demonstration place has to be on foot, then”, says Kujala.</seg>
<seg id="23">The demonstration also cuts off the public transport in Helsinki.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the police point of view this also has a positive side.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem with public transport flow that normally has to be considered in these kinds of crowd meetings will now partly take care of itself.</seg>
<seg id="26">The demonstration organisers have notified the police that there can be tens of thousands of demonstrators opposing the Government’s economic policy arriving to Helsinki.</seg>
<seg id="27">Police expects the demonstration to progress peacefully.</seg>
<seg id="28">“The people are ordinary employed or unemployed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="29">Finnish people are sensible and calm”, says Kujala.</seg>
<seg id="30">There are also local demonstrations organised around Finland on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="1">The demonstration on Friday is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?</seg>
<seg id="2">The big demonstration on Friday organised by trade unions is interesting and exceptional in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="3">For instance, it does not have a very good reference in Finnish political history, says sociology professor emeritus Martti Siisiäinen from University of Jyväskylä.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is no wonder that the trade unions are protesting.</seg>
<seg id="5">If they would not, they would be just putting their arms up in front of the government, says Siisiäinen.</seg>
<seg id="6">The very right-winger government has struck to the central points of Finnish traditional corporatism - and also to those points that have been essential to the development of Finnish welfare state.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government’s hard measures interfere with contract law.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many characteristics that indeed point in the direction that this is an attempt to bring the trade unions to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, the trade unions should take a look in the mirror.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mirror is needed for instance for the fact that the trade unions are far from having all the employees’ support for Friday’s demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is new is the strict polarisation the demonstration creates in that group the trade unions would like to take part in the demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="12">Unemployed from across Finland demonstrated at the Parliament House in November 1993.</seg>
<seg id="13">If we are looking for a comparison for Friday’s demonstration, one such could be found in the mega demonstration of the unemployed, the so-called Turning Point Thursday of 1993, says Siisiäinen.</seg>
<seg id="14">The demonstration, organised during the worst recession, brought together 20,000 unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Esko Aho's (Centre Party) government struggled from one labour market crisis to another.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and employee organisations had never been as bad as during Aho's right-wing government.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now the relationship between the government and the trade unions is maybe even worse than during the Turning Point Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="18">And besides, Finland’s current government is the most right-wing ever, says Siisiäinen.</seg>
<seg id="19">The current government coalition is interesting also in that way that it is so strictly right-wing, despite what the True Finns say.</seg>
<seg id="20">During their election success of 2011, the party still had elements from the old labour movement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Thousands of demonstrators are expected on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="22">The demonstration also stops parts of public traffic, and possibly closes kindergartens and schools.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even though the demonstratin does not have the undivided support of the employees, it can be the biggest in years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In recent years, there have been about 300 demonstrations every year in Helsinki.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are all kinds of topics.</seg>
<seg id="26">Traditionally Finnish trade unions’ demonstrations have been quite peaceful, even though the practices have become harder in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="27">Traditionally one avoids conflict and is law-abiding in a Finnish demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="28">The demonstrators try to avoid damaging or destroying propers, says Siisiäinen.</seg>
<seg id="29">The end of the 1990s brought new impetus, though.</seg>
<seg id="30">The demonstration culture was changed.</seg>
<seg id="31">The EU membership ruffled the farmers enough to make them hurl chicken eggs, and the police prepared for thrown pig shit.</seg>
<seg id="32">The firemen strike of 1998 lasted for three months.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also for example pilots and air traffic controllers had arresting strikes.</seg>
<seg id="34">Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?</seg>
<seg id="35">Metal and electricity strikes in the 1970s</seg>
<seg id="36">The most significant strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike of 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike of 1977.</seg>
<seg id="37">70,000 metal workers took part in the strike.</seg>
<seg id="38">The reconciliation board’s proposal ended the strike after it had lasted 7 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="39">The metal workers got a 16 percent raise.</seg>
<seg id="40">The electricity strike of spring 1977 lasted 49 days and caused power cuts around the country.</seg>
<seg id="41">Turning Point Thursday in 1993</seg>
<seg id="42">About 20,000 people, many of them unemployed because of the recession, gathered in front of the Parliamentary House on 4th November, 1993, to demonstrate for work.</seg>
<seg id="43">The firemen were on strike for three months in 1998</seg>
<seg id="44">The firemen strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strike in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="45">The farmers protested against EU in 1994 and 1999</seg>
<seg id="46">Police were caught in an egg rain, as the farmers protested agains EU in 1994.</seg>
<seg id="47">“Learn the hard way, EU finishes”, is a translation of one of the slogans.</seg>
<seg id="48">The farmers dumped tons of snow on Esplanadi.</seg>
<seg id="49">Also the Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 moved the farmers to protest and burn bales of hay in front of the summit venue.</seg>
<seg id="50">The nurses were on strike in 1983 and 1995</seg>
<seg id="51">The nurses were on strike for about a month in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="52">Previously they had been on strike in 1983.</seg>
<seg id="53">The strike of 1995 was shaded by a few of deaths that happened during the strike.</seg>
<seg id="54">The Union of Health and Social Care Professionals (Tehy) threatened with a strike and nurses’ mass resignations in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="55">The threat of mass resignations finally speeded up the negotiations to reach an outcome.</seg>
<seg id="56">The doctors were on strike in 2001</seg>
<seg id="57">“Doctors forced to strike”, is a translation of the doctors’ strike slogan in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="58">The strike of municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted about 5 months and gave rise to discussion about how strikes can compromise patient safety.</seg>
<seg id="59">After the strike the public sector gave doctors a raise.</seg>
<seg id="60">The students were on the move in 2013</seg>
<seg id="61">About 5,000 students marched for student allowance in Helsinki, from the Senate Square to the Parliamentary House, in 2013.</seg>

<seg id="2">Austrian police has asked the Central Criminal Police to help in investigating the background of the Finnish-registered refugee truck.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Sunday, Austrian police halted a truck with 42 refugees in Aisterheim near the German border.</seg>
<seg id="4">There is no information whether the truck was possible on its way to Finland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those aboard the refrigerated truck are all in good condition.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have exchanged information with Austrian police.</seg>
<seg id="7">The investigation is conducted and the main responsibility is in Austria, the location where this happened, says chief inspector Tero Haapala from the Central Criminal Police.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other refugees travelling aboard a truck in Austria had worse luck.</seg>
<seg id="9">Then all 71 passengers apparently asphyxiated.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Yleisradio, who first reported the cooperation with Austrian police, the truck is owned by a Finnish limited company.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company practices for instance catering and has a person of foreign origin, a man of about 40 years, as its managing director.</seg>
<seg id="12">Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for human smuggling.</seg>

<seg id="1">A refugee-beating captain, an ex-drug courier and an enormously rich business man - the story of five smugglers</seg>
<seg id="2">An enormously rich king of the smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary a taxi driver who thinks he is a good guy.</seg>
<seg id="3">These are an example of people practising human smuggling to European Union.</seg>
<seg id="4">Criminologist working in the University of Trento, Andrea Di Nicola, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their “clients”, and a book called Kuoleman matkatoimisto (Travel Agency of Death) they wrote is published in Finnish this week.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the book they present some of the tentacles of human smuggling, suggest possible solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of the trade.</seg>
<seg id="6">HS introduces five of them.</seg>
<seg id="7">I’ll beat them in their place immediately</seg>
<seg id="8">Kerkennah Island off the east coast of Tunisia are no attraction for foreign tourists, but for many Tunisians, they are a place to spend the summer.</seg>
<seg id="9">As to their location, the islands are an excellent place also for smuggling, because the distance to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a comparison: the distance between Helsinki and Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="11">There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir - a chain-smoker captain and a father of six.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kerkennah Islands are famous for their prawns, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.</seg>
<seg id="13">And that is what Emir has done with his blue, 10-metre, wooden boat for already hundreds of times.</seg>
<seg id="14">If you cram the boat, you can fit 40 people in it.</seg>
<seg id="15">After expenses, Emir makes about 8,000 euros for one trip.</seg>
<seg id="16">Emir has five assistants who search customers for him from all over Tunisia.</seg>
<seg id="17">The customers come from many different countries, but during the Arab Spring, a vast number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.</seg>
<seg id="18">After that the situation quietened down, until it was rekindled along with the refugee crisis.</seg>
<seg id="19">The customers come in small groups from the continent to Kerkennah Islands.</seg>
<seg id="20">Emir houses them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.</seg>
<seg id="21">Food is given in such quantities as to keep the customers barely alive.</seg>
<seg id="22">Housing costs around 75 euros per night, and if a customer runs out of money, it is their problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">The boat leaves at midnight with headlights off.</seg>
<seg id="24">First night they leave the islands, then they stop, wait for a day and go to Lampedusa the next night.</seg>
<seg id="25">Sometimes there are rough seas, and when the waves are 20 metres high, the passenger cry and vomit.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the destination, the human cargo is unloaded in a half an hour and Emir can return.</seg>
<seg id="27">Emir wants to be feared.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is why he beats his customers and, at least allegedly, beats those who oppose him to death.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the book he tells that once when the police spotted him, he through all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.</seg>
<seg id="30">“I grabbed the customers by their necks, one by one, and threw them overboard”, Emir says in the book.</seg>
<seg id="31">The calmest passengers come from sub-Saharan Africa.</seg>
<seg id="32">He says he must beat his own countrymen time after time.</seg>
<seg id="33">I’ll beat them in their place immediately.</seg>
<seg id="34">They must be shown who’s the boss here right away.</seg>
<seg id="35">Just another taxi driver</seg>
<seg id="36">Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="37">His taxi is not very good - the start engine is already on its last legs, and the whole car has seen better days.</seg>
<seg id="38">The most important thing for Goran’s customers, however, is the fact the car is moving in the first place, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.</seg>
<seg id="39">Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometres south-west from Belgrad.</seg>
<seg id="40">Right next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where mostly families are admitted.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the woods surrounding the centre, there are men travelling without their families, taking a room in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars - whatever they have managed to find or build.</seg>
<seg id="42">The woods also house families that, for one reason or another, have not lodged asylum applications to Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="43">Some are also housed in private apartments, but that is an open secret.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is among these forest-dwellers that Goran finds most of his customers.</seg>
<seg id="45">They are often weary - the route via the Balkans includes a great number of border crossings and they have to walk for weeks across difficult terrain, often in the mountains and in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="46">When they finally reach Bogovaða area, the great node for human smuggling, the people are exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="47">Goran’s customers are mainly Syrian, Afghanistani, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurd.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Syrian are the best customers, he tells in the book.</seg>
<seg id="49">“They say what they have to say once and that is enough”, Goran commends.</seg>
<seg id="50">According to him, the Africans try to haggle.</seg>
<seg id="51">Goran doesn’t like that.</seg>
<seg id="52">It’s blah blah blah the whole journey.</seg>
<seg id="53">First we agree on for example 300 euros, then they lower it to 200, and finally they offer 150.</seg>
<seg id="54">Goran emphasises that he is a nice man with a good heart.</seg>
<seg id="55">I am not interested in money.</seg>
<seg id="56">“I just do my work and help people”, he says in the book.</seg>
<seg id="57">Goran says that he does this for less money than the others, and that he only takes 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.</seg>
<seg id="58">The distance is about 300 kilometres, most of it comfortably along the motorway.</seg>
<seg id="59">Allegedly his colleagues ask for triple or quadruple the price.</seg>
<seg id="60">Goran makes about 50,000 euros a year.</seg>
<seg id="61">For a smuggler that is not a huge sum, but in Serbia it is a rather comfortable annual income.</seg>
<seg id="62">Serbia has decreed that taxis are not allowed to drive the migrants nearer than within 12 kilometres to the Hungarian border.</seg>
<seg id="63">Goran doesn’t care about that: he knows the routes and shortcuts, and takes his passengers within a kilometre from the border.</seg>
<seg id="64">Then he points the customers to the right direction and drives away.</seg>
<seg id="65">Acts of kindness</seg>
<seg id="66">The 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary, and that is not just a nick name.</seg>
<seg id="67">He really has a protestant church in the Ugandan capital Kampala, where lots of believers that have fled from Congo come to, and a small centre, where Congolese child refugees find help.</seg>
<seg id="68">In addition to preaching, the Missionary has a smuggling business that moves people from Congo to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="69">He sees this as an act of kindness.</seg>
<seg id="70">For the Missionary, it is important to look good.</seg>
<seg id="71">He has his shoes shined many times a day and takes care that the rubber band of his white underpants can be stylishly seen from under the low waistline of his jeans.</seg>
<seg id="72">The Missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his ATV and his three motorcycles.</seg>
<seg id="73">When the Missionary is not preaching, he is organising people from Congo to Uganda and onwards to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="74">First a customer calls one of the Missionary’s five phone numbers.</seg>
<seg id="75">He advises that you should be on the border in the morning, hide your money carefully and slip among the vendors crossing the border.</seg>
<seg id="76">In order to reach the status of an asylum seeker or a refugee, you have to tell the Ugandan officials that you are originally from for example the warzone of northern Kivu, and that you have had to flee your home because of the violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">Most of the time it is true, but if it is not, the Missionary will organise a new identity for his customer.</seg>
<seg id="78">You get rid of the old identification card and get a new one to replace it.</seg>
<seg id="79">The Missionary’s contacts in the Ugandan police help in this.</seg>
<seg id="80">After this the customer is directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go to: to the asylum procedure, to non-governmental organisations, finally to UN refugee organisation UNHCR.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Missionary knows the red tape, because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.</seg>
<seg id="82">He charges separately for each step: making an application to the Ugandan police is about 100 euros, delivering your papers to a humanitarian organisation around 150 and migration process for example to an European country from 4,500 to 7,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="83">Aluminium foil and icecubes</seg>
<seg id="84">Tom is a novice smuggler, an ex drug courier.</seg>
<seg id="85">The Irishman in his forties is on call in Calais on the French coast, where his job is to load people to lorries on their way to Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="86">To help him, there is an Afghanistani living in London, a French taxi driver and dozens of lorry drivers, who do not necessarily even know they are involved in human smuggling business.</seg>
<seg id="87">In the night Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2 or 3 people, from somewhere around the centre of Calais.</seg>
<seg id="88">The drive the motorway A26 and try to avoid the police.</seg>
<seg id="89">If the police were to stop the car in the motorway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="90">Tom doesn’t want that, he has already done seven years for drugs.</seg>
<seg id="91">The taxi pulls over, Tom and his customers run over the motorway to a lay-by where the drivers sleep before continuing over the Channel to Britain.</seg>
<seg id="92">Tom selects a suitable lorry - you have to make sure that it is on its way to England and not to Holland, for example - and cuts the safety cable of the tarpaulin.</seg>
<seg id="93">You have to be quiet in order to not wake up the drivers.</seg>
<seg id="94">Sometime the driver is in on the plot, but the it’s more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="95">When the way is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminium foil, the same kind that is used in the kitchen to wrap around a roast or a jacket potato.</seg>
<seg id="96">That should prevent the police’s heat scanner from finding the hideaway.</seg>
<seg id="97">Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice cubes for the same purpose.</seg>
<seg id="98">Tom leaves his customers to the lorry and leaves the place hoping that the driver doesn’t notice the stowaways at least until they reach Britain.</seg>
<seg id="99">The king of the smugglers</seg>
<seg id="100">Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.</seg>
<seg id="101">The enormously rich Turk has been called a master of marketing and an undeniable king of Mediterranean illegal landings. He controls the sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly to Greece and Italy.</seg>
<seg id="102">Küçük has been active since the 1990s, and he has continually developed new methods for smuggling.</seg>
<seg id="103">He also has a certain competitive edge compered to other entrepreneurs: he demands the money at the destination.</seg>
<seg id="104">One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: luxury yachts are hired from Turkish harbours as if to take American or European families to pleasant tourist cruises for a couple of days.</seg>
<seg id="105">In reality, the yachts are crammed with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghanis, who are transported for a fee of 5,000 to 7,000 euros first from Istanbul overland to a harbour, and from there to Europe by sea.</seg>
<seg id="106">Customers are kept in human storehouses, for instance in old industrial halls, until it is their time to go.</seg>
<seg id="107">They are crammed into minibuses and taken to someplace on the coast.</seg>
<seg id="108">They are told to hide among the vegetation and to wait for a signal.</seg>
<seg id="109">When it is given, the ship has to be boarded quickly</seg>
<seg id="110">The customers have to stay hidden under the deck for the whole journey.</seg>
<seg id="111">The coast guard can only monitor the draft of the ship, since that might be the only sign of a crowd.</seg>
<seg id="112">Food and drink are given, but the less the passengers defecate and vomit, the better.</seg>
<seg id="113">After expenses, Küçük receives about 53,000 euros from a luxury yacht trip.</seg>
<seg id="114">He does not take care of the practicalities, but hires the captains, recruiters, guards, housing organisers and other less important persons to take care of the work for him.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the summer season there are at least hundreds of journeys, and Küçük makes millions.</seg>
<seg id="116">It is believed that via a front-company, he has bought land, a pharmaceutical firm and over a hundred apartments he rents out.</seg>
<seg id="117">Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same with a Turkey’s Democratic Party’s representative and a certain pharmaceutical entrepreneur.</seg>
<seg id="118">After that it seems that he has disappeared.</seg>

<seg id="2">Three-time Olympian 1500 metre runner Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book has attracted attention in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">In her book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells about how she quit her career and ended up as an escort.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sports Illustrated published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Favor Hamilton ended her career in Sydney Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="6">She took part in the competition in top shape and ran the second fastest time in the qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the finals she panicked, though.</seg>
<seg id="8">Right in the beginning she ran to the lead and defended her position running like a maniac.</seg>
<seg id="9">150 metres before the goal her strength ran out, however.</seg>
<seg id="10">She fell to the track and other runners passed her one after another.</seg>
<seg id="11">I felt like an idiot and thought I will never run again.</seg>
<seg id="12">I forced myself to cross the goal line, says Favor Hamilton in her book.</seg>
<seg id="13">Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="14">Her brother Dan had committed a suicide a year before Sydney Olympics, and she was under terrible pressure to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Favor Hamilton was 43 years old when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.</seg>
<seg id="16">The couple had no financial problems, but she was intrigued by the idea of receiving money from having sex with strange men.</seg>
<seg id="17">She also persuaded her husband to approve her actions.</seg>
<seg id="18">Favor Hamilton’s rate was 450 euros per hour.</seg>
<seg id="19">She says she used the money in luxury life.</seg>
<seg id="20">One Favor Hamilton’s explanation for becoming a prostitute was the fact she missed the same adrenaline spikes she had while competing.</seg>
<seg id="21">Later Favor Hamilton found out that she had bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="22">The former star athlete’s double life was exposed in the end of 2012, when Smoking Gun published an article about her.</seg>
<seg id="23">Favor Hamilton participated in three Olympiads: Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2000 she was number on in the statistics for 1500 metres, her time being 3.57,40, but she was the last in Sydney Olympic finals.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ski king of Norway, Petter Northug, has crossed the border of propriety, at least in one of his colleagues’ books.</seg>
<seg id="3">Northug and Norway’s national ski federation have discussed his athlete agreement through the whole summer and autumn, just like last year.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though the federation has offered Northug a better deal than for the other athletes, even that has not been enough for this multiple world champion and Olympic gold medal winner.</seg>
<seg id="5">As a result of this deal disagreement, the ski federation of Norway decided to drop Northug from the next season’s World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="6">The decision was praised by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.</seg>
<seg id="7">She said she is happy the federation decided to discipline the ski rooster.</seg>
<seg id="8">“Thank you for showing some backbone”, Jacobsen wrote on her Facebook profile.</seg>
<seg id="9">“We cannot allow for one active athlete to be exempt from working for the federation’s sponsor”, she continued.</seg>
<seg id="10">The argument between the ski federation of Norway and Northug is about money.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seems that Northug would like to be away from the national team for part of the season in order to be able to promote his own sponsor.</seg>
<seg id="12">Jacobsen said she is also happy to represent a federation that takes care also of the future generations and does not let one athlete to play solo.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time she reminded people that the federation has given Northug both economic as well other privileges for several years.</seg>
<seg id="14">I know this, because I have been part of the system.</seg>
<seg id="15">Jacobsen does not approve of one athlete having a whole different set of rules just because he is the best.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Tuesday Northug published his own announcement ensuring that he wants to represent in Norway’s colours also next season in the World Cup, as well as in the World Championship and the Olympics after that.</seg>
<seg id="17">During her career, Astrid Jacobsen won all in all six World Championship medals, two of them golden.</seg>

<seg id="1">Media researcher: Sipilä is taking a big risk</seg>
<seg id="2">According to Sipilä, varied channels are needed in communication, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.</seg>
<seg id="3">This kind of a channel for direct speech will be needed in the future, too.</seg>
<seg id="4">This will not be the last time, Sipilä told the reporters in the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sipilä did not yet want to estimate how recurrent these premier’s speeches broadcasted through television and radio are going to be.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Sipilä, the speeches will not necessarily always be broadcast from Yle channels.</seg>
<seg id="7">If there are other channels available, we will see then.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tonight we are using this channel, Sipilä said.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Sipilä, situation of the Finnish economy is so dire that it requires to hold a broadcasted speech to the citizens.</seg>
<seg id="10">This whole complex of issues currently in question is quite intricate and calls for a longer reasoning.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why we chose this channel, explained Sipilä.</seg>
<seg id="12">The speech will be broadcast between 9.05 and 9.20 PM both via TV1 and Radio Suomi.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is also available in Yle Areena.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sipilä is taking a big risk</seg>
<seg id="15">Media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s televised speech is not a symptom of the government’s more general turn inwards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Is the goal to take the right to define public discussion more tightly in their own hands and to turn down the framing of questions in the public discussion? Anu Koivunen, a professor in the University of Stockholm contemplates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This reminds me of the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini's recent comment about how he will not follow the media’s agenda, nor will he let it define himself.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the name of democratic discussion and publicity I hope that these matters are not related.</seg>
<seg id="19">Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant about Sipilä’s announcement.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would be odd, if the media would not react.</seg>
<seg id="21">In a democracy, the political decision makers’ communicational styles are not something just to be announced.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is the job of media representatives by definition to strive not to take politicians’ agendas as given.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Koivunen, a televised speech is a big risk for Sipilä.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sipilä should introduce something new and special in his speech, in order to fulfill the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.</seg>
<seg id="25">Are we going to get more of that what we have already heard?</seg>
<seg id="26">Or is he able to adopt a different tone, different manner or different words, or to say something new?</seg>
<seg id="27">Koivunen says that if all there will be is just same old, we have to wonder the motivation behind this grand gesture and why Yle allocated exceptional time for it?</seg>
<seg id="28">This is a risk for Yle, as well, in the sense that if this turns out to be not a special situation but just a routine speech among others.</seg>
<seg id="29">The danger is that Yle is labelled as a medium for politicians or the parliament or the government, which would most definitely not be in line with Yle's interests or general policy.</seg>
<seg id="30">A smart move from Sipilä</seg>
<seg id="31">In Sipilä's forthcoming speech important will also be what the Prime Minister leaves unsaid, emphasises the media researcher.</seg>
<seg id="32">Research coordinator of University of Jyväskylä, Heikki Kuutti, says that one should pay special attention to what Sipilä discusses and what he will not.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to Kuutti, a televised speech is a smart move from Sipilä, since this way he is able to highlight his own views without discordant notes.</seg>
<seg id="34">This way the message has a large audience without any journalistic filters, unlike in a press conference, where journalists are able to ask critical questions.</seg>
<seg id="35">Sipilä overrides the media and addresses the people directly.</seg>
<seg id="36">The danger is that media interprets parts of the speech in a wrong way, since there is no possibility to ask further questions.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to Kuutti it is vital how Sipilä presents himself in the television - is he sweating, are his hands shaking.</seg>
<seg id="38">He compares Sipilä to a father figure, who is now telling the people what to they need to do.</seg>
<seg id="39">If Sipilä can put his points well, it can work.</seg>
<seg id="40">The situation is different from one where the government would be informing the public, since this is more like one human being speaking to another.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is what (the President of the United States Barack) Obama and associates do regularly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Quite exceptional</seg>
<seg id="43">Parliamentary researcher Erkka Railo thinks the Prime Minister’s speech to the citizens is quite exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="44">According to him, it is something that has not taken place in decades - that the Prime Minister directly addresses the people.</seg>
<seg id="45">Exceptional times require exceptional measures, Railo says.</seg>
<seg id="46">The researcher believes that by acting this way, the Prime Minister wants to make Finns sympathetic to the tightenings that will come.</seg>
<seg id="47">Employee associations will organise a demonstration on Friday and strikes against the government’s actions.</seg>
<seg id="48">The Left Alliance leader Paavo Arhinmäki said via Twitter that Sipilä could make his speech about the situation of the nation also in the parliament as a Prime Minister’s announcement, which would allow for discussion.</seg>
<seg id="49">The leader of the Social Democratic Party Antti Rinne declares that he will challenge Sipilä to a dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="50">There is no time for monologues.</seg>
<seg id="51">It has been almost six months since the election.</seg>
<seg id="52">One cannot hide for ever, Rinne writes via Twitter.</seg>

<seg id="4">Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and moved to Finland in the age of five with his family, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious ultimate fighting league UFC.</seg>

<seg id="2">SAK President Lauri Lyly told on Twitter that the labour organisation will consider its opinion about STTK’s alternative savings list on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lauri Lyly commented on STTK proposal on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Finnish Confederation of Professionals STTK said earlier on Wednesday they are going to present the Government their own proposal, which would able to reach the five per cent productivity leap required by the Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).</seg>
<seg id="5">Akava President Sture Fjäder believes that the Government will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava all stand behind it.</seg>
<seg id="6">That would require though that the biggest labour organisation SAK softens its earlier opinion.</seg>
<seg id="7">As for SAK President Lauri Lyly, he commented the matter briefly on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lyly writes that the SAK work committee will discuss the matter on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to “open the labour market lock”, and that instead of mandatory laws, what is needed are agreements between active parties.</seg>
<seg id="10">Lyly reminds people that SAK did not accept Prime Minister Sipilä’s Government’s proposal for social contract.</seg>

<seg id="2">It does feel a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.</seg>
<seg id="3">The mood varies from side to side in the salary earners’ camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">What is the goal, to shout the Government over or to settle with it?</seg>
<seg id="5">On Monday the leaders of SAK were raging with righteous anger against the Government of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="6">They threatened to shut down whole Finland.</seg>
<seg id="7">The bluster spread among Akava members, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Trade Union of Education OAJ threatened to close schools and nurseries.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Tuesday OAJ was cancelling: no schools or nurseries are completely closed.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Wednesday the Chairman of Finnish Confederation of Salaried Employees STTK, Antti Palola (Social Democrats), appeared in public in a placatory way.</seg>
<seg id="11">He told he had been in contact with the Government and was drafting an alternative proposal for the five per cent productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).</seg>
<seg id="12">Akava Presiden Sture Fjäder (Coalition) immediately rushed to inform that his reconciliation paper is already ready.</seg>
<seg id="13">At first the SAK office did not utter a word.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is hard for President Lauri Lyly (Social Democrats) to fraternise, as it was just on Monday the union leaders told to stop the country on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="15">Finally Lyly did announce that SAK work committee will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK is looking for solutions to “open the labour market lock”.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to put together employees’ common proposal, SAK needs to give in and accept the five per cent productivity leap as a goal.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is no wonder that Palola’s STTK has good relations to Sipilä’s government.</seg>
<seg id="18">Palola’s right hand, STTK director of public affairs Jukka Ihanus used to be special adviser for the Central party prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.</seg>
<seg id="19">Palola defines that the Government’s trade union knowledge has gotten better all the time.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian speaker of the lower house of parliament, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Russian speaker of the lower house of the parliament, Sergei Naryshkin, said Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Autumn Meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has began in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, where Naryshkin thoroughly commented on the Helsinki anniversary meeting in July.</seg>
<seg id="5">Finland did not allow the Russian politicians, like Naryshkin, who had ended on the European Union blacklist to take part in the meeting - a matter the speaker continued to remind the reporters about.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to our estimation, this was against the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="7">This cannot happen again, emphasised Naryshkin according to news agency Interfax.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin also criticised the United States, who also banned him from entering the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">The sanctions are a political suicide for EU, declared Naryshkin.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Russian delegation had no problems entering Mongolia, so Naryshkin continued to snipe at Finland by complimenting and acknowledging Mongolia for its “excellent organising”.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am sure that the parliamentary assembly will be constructive and have positive results, unlike the July summit in Helsinki.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mongolian leadership understand that there are supposed to be no obstacles for parliamentary dialogue.</seg>

<seg id="10">During the two previous seasons it has been exactly Tappara who has won Lukko and progressed to the finals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Point of view: A lousy play underway in Ässät</seg>
<seg id="2">Sports Director Toivola scripted a sequel unsuitable for Head Coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a classic.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a script to Rocky, in which he starred himself.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sensationally the underdog stood up to heavyweight world champion, Apollo Creed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even though he lost the title match, Rocky evoked great sympathy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola scripted a restless Cinderella story to Pori.</seg>
<seg id="8">The nameless and wooden-handed bunch of spades surprised everyone by advancing to the season finals in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="9">The team was full of Rocky-like nameless but tenacious underdogs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Valkoinen intiaani, Porin Matti and Pele Peltonen were some of the names.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the playoffs, the players dyed their hair red and cut it to a Mohawk hairdo.</seg>
<seg id="12">Toivola turned blonde.</seg>
<seg id="13">An excellent TV commentator JP Jalo named the coach Neumann.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ässät won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">Toivola was one of the heroes.</seg>
<seg id="16">The scriptwriter Toivola believes that this season's new work will function the same way as ten years ago.</seg>
<seg id="17">Working as a Sports director for Ässät, he has built the spade deck on a foundation of bd bois.</seg>
<seg id="18">Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have thrashed blokes in the rink like Rocky thrashed pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse.</seg>
<seg id="19">Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen all have their merits outside puck handling.</seg>
<seg id="20">Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, main part is played by Pekka Rautakallio.</seg>
<seg id="21">Karri Kivi has christened Rautakallio Sean Connery.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Toivola’s script of Rocky, Rautakallio is as clumsy a protagonist as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is nothing Rocky in Rautakallio besides his nickname.</seg>
<seg id="24">Rautakallio’s game philosophy does not include rushing or minor clamouring.</seg>
<seg id="25">He values hard play, but playing hard is different than playing dirty.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last season, Garret Stafford from Ässät checked Jere Karjalainen from Tappara to the head.</seg>
<seg id="27">He got 2+10 minutes from the referees, but Rautakallio removed him from the play.</seg>
<seg id="28">He did not merit one minute!</seg>
<seg id="29">Only those that deserve it are allowed to play.</seg>
<seg id="30">I do not approve that kind of play, and it is not part of team Ässät hockey, snarled Rautakallio annoyed after the game for Satakunnan Kansa.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Ässät team for the season is weirdly constructed.</seg>
<seg id="32">There are juniors, veterans, police and those who rush into things.</seg>
<seg id="33">There are practically no key players in their prime.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is no wonder then that the Head Coach has complained about the lack of skills.</seg>
<seg id="35">How much have you been able to affect the player selections, Pekka Rautakallio?</seg>
<seg id="36">The events of the last season affect the selection and, unfortunately, the situation at the player market was quite limited, Rautakallio answes diplomatically.</seg>
<seg id="37">Simmering beneath the surface.</seg>
<seg id="38">Rautakallio, a 1953 model, is, as far as is known, interested in transferring to Toivola's post as a Sports Director.</seg>
<seg id="39">Both the men’s contracts end this spring.</seg>
<seg id="40">The team's balance in three league matches has been the same number of defeats, with a goal difference of 1-6.</seg>
<seg id="41">Toivola should have opted out of writing the script for the sequel.</seg>

<seg id="2">Olga Temonen reveals tha if she had met his husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.</seg>
<seg id="3">Olga Temonen is acting under his husband’s direction for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yes, in the film I will play the role of my husband’s friend’s mother.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a way it feels crazy, laughs actor and producer Olga Temonen.</seg>
<seg id="6">She has been married to the Apulanta ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Previously, the couple has often worked together, too, but this is the first time Olga will act under Tuukka’s direction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Her role in the film protraying the early years of Apulanta, Teit meistä kauniin, is drummer Sipe Santapukki’s mother Sirkka.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sirkka encourages and supports his son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.</seg>
<seg id="10">The more I have come to know my real role model Sirkka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.</seg>
<seg id="11">She is a great person and I am grateful for Tuukka for entrusting me with the role.</seg>
<seg id="12">Olga had met Sirkka already before the film project, but after that the pair has become considerably closer.</seg>
<seg id="13">They have met, talked in the telephone and sent messages.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sirkka has been a great help.</seg>
<seg id="15">We have gone through their history from different angles.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sirkka luckily also understands that drama is drama and the truth might have to be coloured in a bit.</seg>
<seg id="17">Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola to blindly believe that Apulanta will be the biggest band in Finland.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was the recession in the 90s and living was really bleak.</seg>
<seg id="19">The probability for someone to really make it is pretty slight, but Sirkka had some kind of an intuition, and she was right.</seg>
<seg id="20">Olga tells that she had heard a lot of stories from Tuukka’s adolescence already before the film plans.</seg>
<seg id="21">The parents’ stories have at times been slightly different, though.</seg>
<seg id="22">Well, if you are a 15-year-old teenager, how much will your parents really know about what you were doing.</seg>
<seg id="23">Olga reveals that her own adolescence was complitely different from Tuukka’s, who was known as the infamous skater from Heinola.</seg>
<seg id="24">Olga was an ordinary and good girl, who would have had nothing to do with the Tuukka from the film.</seg>
<seg id="25">At most she could have secretly taken to him.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to Olga, she has cooperated so much with Tuukka during a decade that a big project together does not scare her.</seg>
<seg id="27">Everything has always gone super well.</seg>
<seg id="28">Now the whole production crew will spend a month in Heinola filming.</seg>
<seg id="29">The couple who live in Iitti will, however, often drive back home to spend the night with their small children, as the distance is not too great.</seg>
<seg id="30">We are taking over the whole Heinola for a month.</seg>
<seg id="31">They have welcomed us really warmly, just asking which streets should be emptied and when.</seg>

<seg id="8">The shooting of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, begins in October in AED Studios’ facility near Antwerp and will last for eight weeks.</seg>
<seg id="9">The director Timo Vuorensola leaves for Belgium already next week.</seg>
<seg id="10">I’m not afraid of the huge budget.</seg>
<seg id="11">I've been really amazingly relaxed!</seg>
<seg id="12">I have such a relaxed feeling about the script, since I know exactly what the film should be like.</seg>
<seg id="13">Everybody in the work group seem to realise we are doing something incredible-</seg>
<seg id="14">It awesome to go to Belgium.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even though we’ve a tight schedule, I’ve no fear.</seg>
<seg id="16">I more excited, and can’t wait to be able to show this movie to the public, he told to Iltalehti.</seg>
<seg id="17">Originally the budget of the film was supposed to be 8-10 million, but as the script developed, so did the budget.</seg>
<seg id="18">The budget is big, but so is the story.</seg>
<seg id="19">I could put 100 million into this film, because every camera angle and special effect cost so much.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now everything is so tight that there is no slack anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="21">Today, on Wednesday, the production company of the film, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and bonds with an annual interest of 4 to 8 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="22">The final interest depends on the supply and demand during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="23">The company will repay the loan after two years the latest.</seg>
<seg id="24">The action film stars for example Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dork or cool?</seg>
<seg id="2">Big logos make a return to shirts</seg>
<seg id="3">Lately trendsetters’ shirt fronts have been decorated by big logos.</seg>
<seg id="4">A while ago a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like they avoided Crocs.</seg>
<seg id="5">Advertising the brand of a hoodie or a t-shirt was seen somewhat rustic.</seg>
<seg id="6">But times, they are a-changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sportiness has been a real mega trend in fashion, and that means also old familiar sport fashion brands like Adidas and Nike have risen to the crest of the cool wave.</seg>
<seg id="8">And like so many times before, the line between funny and trendy is fine: if something is very bumpkinish, it will start to change into ironic and cool.</seg>
<seg id="9">First came norm core trend, or regular fashion, in which trendsetters surprised by favouring as boring as possible basic clothes as if as a way to separate themselves from the masses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now, instead of a basic grey sweatshirts they wear the sweats that were already buried in the bottom of the wardrobe and that have a brand logo in front of them.</seg>
<seg id="11">The bigger and more traditional the better.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition to logos, also for example the recognisable Adidas stripes, jerseys of your favourite team and New York Yankees baseball caps have made a return to street fashion.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Calvin Klein logos in underwear peaking from under the edge of jeans are now a cool detail.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trend seems to be moving from sport brands also to luxury brands.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example the chest of Versace's autumn shirts makes the brand of the garment quite obvious.</seg>
<seg id="16">Would you be prepared to showcase logos in your clothing?</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian politician published proof: I did not get stuck in a tank hatch for hours!</seg>
<seg id="2">Allegedly this unusual incident happened in Nizhny Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held, presenting products of Russian war industry.</seg>
<seg id="3">Over the last few days, the Russian media have spread colourful claims stating Russian Emergency Situations Ministry had to work five hours releasing sizeable Zotov from the tank hatch.</seg>
<seg id="4">Later Zotov has made all the effort to deny the information.</seg>
<seg id="5">He even published a photo on his own, public Facebook page, showing him peeking from the armoured vehicle in a rather good mood, and at least according to these pictures, he did not get stuck or angry.</seg>
<seg id="6">Complete nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="7">Let us start with me not going inside a battle tank, since it was an infantry fighting vehicle BMP-3.</seg>
<seg id="8">I am a former soldier myself, lieutenant colonel, I have served in Ural.</seg>
<seg id="9">I went inside, took a look around and calmly exited, Zatov stated to Komsomolskaya Pravda.</seg>
<seg id="10">I did not get stuck and I most definitely did not spend five hours in that position, he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">To Russian army’s TV channel Zotov explained that he was admiring Russian new technology in the expo, since he is a former regular himself.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is why I was interested what is inside the vehicles, I was admiring our technology.</seg>
<seg id="13">And I exited through the rear hatch, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I visited all the tanks.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the infantry fighting vehicles also in the next expo, promised Zotov.</seg>
<seg id="16">Zotov also called the journalist writing about the matter an idiot.</seg>
<seg id="17">One idiot wrote, everyone else repeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">No such thing happened.</seg>
<seg id="19">I went in, and I came out.</seg>
<seg id="20">I am tall and robust, but nothing like me getting stuck in a tank did not happen, he said to radio Russkaya sluzhba novostei.</seg>
<seg id="21">Zotov’s claims are supported by the fact that there are no published photos about the alleged incident, even though a total of 50.000 people visited the arms expo during a few days.</seg>
<seg id="22">The claim about Zotov getting stuck originated from a story on Bloknot.ru website, where it was described that Zotov struggled trying to get out of the tank hatch, finally threatening to shoot everyone around him, unless he can escape.</seg>
<seg id="23">Later Bloknot published a sequel story, in hwich the expo organisers share their own view about what happened.</seg>
<seg id="24">Everybody is just used to seeing soldiers quickly jumping out of armoured vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="25">But due to his large size, parliamentarian Zotov simply took his time coming out.</seg>
<seg id="26">But under no circumstances did he sit there for five hours, said the expo coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevskiy to Bloknot.</seg>

<seg id="4">The pond contains neutralised ore-processing sand and treated process water from the flotation process.</seg>
<seg id="5">Usually the water is either pumped to be used again as a process water or conveyed through an overland flow field to the environment, as specified in the permit.</seg>
<seg id="6">The leakage was about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was discovered.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the company, the leak water quality complies with the current permit conditions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other materials did not leak to the environment.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leak was discovered during an inspection round on Monday morning.</seg>

<seg id="2">Today the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its country report for Finland, and it is mainly in line with the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="3">The organisation urged Finland to apply comprehensive structural reforms in order to overcome economic problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to IMF, reducing overtime compensations and paid days off would support Finland’s competitiveness.</seg>
<seg id="5">Reforms are needed in the whole agreement system and in unemployment benefits.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Danske Bank chief economist, Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is a consensus on structural reforms, but also some differences.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are many approving messages for the government’s actions in the IMF report, but also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.</seg>
<seg id="8">These include, for example, investments on infrastructure, Kuoppamäki told to Taloussanomat.</seg>
<seg id="9">IMF considers that also the growth projects should be executed as quickly as possible, so that they would support weak economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="10">For this year, IMF forecast for Finland is 0.4 per cent economic growth, which is expected to rise to 0.9 per cent the next year.</seg>
<seg id="11">In their new economic outlook, Danske expects the growth this year will remain at zero per cent.</seg>
<seg id="12">IMF is slightly more optimistic about this year.</seg>
<seg id="13">They might have used recent observations as their basis.</seg>
<seg id="14">This morning, Statistics Finland said the total production was slightly growing during the summer, says Kuoppamäki.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is possible that the so called softer indicators, like for example decreased confidence in industry, have not been paid so much attention to.</seg>
<seg id="16">The difference is, however, only some decimals of a per cent.</seg>

<seg id="1">More and more underage asylum seekers come to Finland alone</seg>
<seg id="2">Swedish immigration service confessed already in February 2015 that hundreds of children who have come to the country disappear every year.</seg>
<seg id="3">This was reported by for instance SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their websites. According to Swedish immigration service, hundreds of underage applicants disappear every year in the country.</seg>
<seg id="4">Senior Inspector Juha Kannelmaa from the Finnish Immigration Service describes the situation in Finland and how it has changed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is the situation in Finland the same?</seg>
<seg id="6">How many applicants disappear “underground” every year? - In 2013 there was a total of 156 asylum applications of underage children who arrived alone.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nine of them disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 there were 196 such applications, and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the background of a disappearance can be that when the case is ongoing it is found out that the applicant is already registered in some other country applying Dublin regulation and that the applicant might have been discovered to be of age there.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it might be more appealing to an applicant to disappear than to continue with the case in Finland and to face refoulement to the country responsible for the application processing.</seg>
<seg id="11">In proportion, part of those who disappeared are also found later, when they apply for an asylum in some other member country.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2014, the total number of asylum seekers in Finland was 3,651, of which 134 applications were dropped on account of the applicant most likely had moved away from Finland, so a total of 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared last year, he says.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the numbers growing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This year by 6 September we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from underage children arriving alone.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are no total statistics yet of underage asylum seekers who have disappeared this year, but the number of underage applicants is known and it has clearly grown, which most likely will also have an effect on the number of disappearances, she emphasises.</seg>
<seg id="16">What happens to those who receive a decision of deportation?</seg>
<seg id="17">Are some of them lost for example to “grey labour market”?</seg>
<seg id="18">This is a difficult thing for the Immigration Services to estimate, since deportation implementation is a responsibility of the police, stresses Kannelmaa.</seg>
<seg id="19">Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Coalition) has been worried about the growing number of unregistered people coming to the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has taken steps in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="21">Orpo, who considered the refugee question in the meeting of European interior ministers, on Monday shared some practical actions about how to manage the flow of refugees via Sweden to northern Finland.</seg>

<seg id="2">The police of South Lake Minnetonka has for almost a week now investigated the family murder that took place in Greenwood, Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="3">A family of five was found dead from their home on September 10, and a couple of days later the police confirmed the shooter to be the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.</seg>
<seg id="4">After first killing his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short shot himself in the house’s garage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dead for days</seg>
<seg id="6">The family was found after the school was beginning to worry about the children's absence.</seg>
<seg id="7">Based on this notification, the police went to inspect the house and found the Short family dead from different corners of the huge house.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead already for days.</seg>
<seg id="9">House worth of millions and a successful company</seg>
<seg id="10">South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Mike Siitari says the investigation of the case is still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="11">The motive behind the bloody deed is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="12">The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his fortune creating a social media website for nurses, AllNurses.com.</seg>
<seg id="13">In 2014 StarTribune interview Short told there were 4 million unique visitors on the website every week.</seg>
<seg id="14">I have had 50 buyouts during the last ten years.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have turned them all down.</seg>
<seg id="16">I do, however, have many ideas I want to realise.</seg>
<seg id="17">Maybe I will send the company at some point, but not yet.</seg>
<seg id="18">The success could be seen in for example that in 2011 Short family bought a mansion in Greenwood for $2 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">The real estate site Zillow advertises the property as a car collector’s dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage for 8 cars.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lawsuit pending</seg>
<seg id="21">According to StarTribune, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit, though.</seg>
<seg id="22">Achieve Test Prep, who offer different prepping courses, had sued him for some comments on AllNurses.com website.</seg>
<seg id="23">Achieve Test Prep alleged that Short’s website failed to delete defamatory comments about prep courses, thus sending business to a competitor.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the lawsuit would have had much significance on Short's business.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6,7 million euros) to Montreal Children’s Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the hospital’s announcement, this is the all-time biggest single charity donation made by an athlete in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, 26-year-old Subban has pledged to help the hospital in other fundraising for the next seven years.</seg>
<seg id="5">A year ago, Subban made an 8-year contract worth 72 million dollars with the Canadiens.</seg>
<seg id="6">That means Subban's donation is significantly larger than his 9-million dollar annual earnings.</seg>
<seg id="7">As a recognition for his donation, an atrium in the hospital will be named after Subban.</seg>
<seg id="8">Canadiens players have already before significantly helped the local hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="9">The long-time captain, Jean Beliveau, who passed away a year ago raised millions of dollars for, for instance, the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a hefty sum to another big hospital in the city, which was used to buy a PET scanner needed in cancer examinations.</seg>

<seg id="7">And each season new girls arrive, and the veterans must compete against the fresh faces.</seg>
<seg id="8">Models rarely have a place of their own to call home.</seg>

<seg id="2">Roope Salminen will play the role of the founding member of Apulanta, Antti Lautala, in the film based on the early years of the band.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lautala started Apulanta in 1991 together with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is quite a challenge to me, since I’m a rap artist of nearly 26 years, and in the film I’m a 16-year-old guitarist, laughs Salminen.</seg>
<seg id="5">I haven’t wanted to meet the real Antti before shooting, since I want to make my own interpretation of him.</seg>
<seg id="6">Antti is clearly the least known of that group, so I think it’s a good thing I’m learning his style of playing only from a video.</seg>
<seg id="7">I don’t want to make an imitation of a person.</seg>
<seg id="8">The head of Roope Salminen ja Koirat band does not have to play the role starting from a scratch.</seg>

<seg id="10">In the punk episode of Tähdet, tähdet show many people surely had a foretaste, and the same applies if you have ever come to our gigs.</seg>
<seg id="11">Our gigs have never been conventional, but we always have a full speed on.</seg>

<seg id="1">Psychologist advises: This is how to tell children about refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Many parent has had to wonder about how to tell a child about the situation of the refugees coming to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">Or should they tell anything about it?</seg>
<seg id="4">You do not have to force the discussion, advises member of the Finnish Red Cross crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.</seg>
<seg id="5">You should protect smaller children and not let them for example watch the news alone.</seg>
<seg id="6">Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and that can remain whirling in their minds, causing anxiety, he says.</seg>
<seg id="7">If a child has seen an image of refugees in the television or heard about it elsewhere, you should discuss the matter.</seg>
<seg id="8">You should start the discussion from the child’s point of view and listen closely what she or he asks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fears of a child can be surprising.</seg>
<seg id="10">They are necessary not the same a parent thinks the child is fearing.</seg>
<seg id="11">You should not scare the child for no reason, even though you yourself are anxious or even scared.</seg>
<seg id="12">A smaller child closely follows parents’ behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="13">If parents stay calm during the discussion, also the child feels safe.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bigger children most likely hear discussion about refugees in school, with friends or online.</seg>
<seg id="15">If the child is thinking about the matter, the parents should discuss it with the child.</seg>
<seg id="16">The fact is that not all the people in the world are well-off.</seg>
<seg id="17">The parents can, together with the children, think how our family feels about this.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do we think the world is eventually a safe or an unsafe place.</seg>
<seg id="19">The parents may also have different parenting views - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as well as they can.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand: If the family discusses also the difficult issues, the child is given a model about how to deal with difficulties in life.</seg>
<seg id="21">This can come in handy later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pallosalama striking Vermo is hard to control</seg>
<seg id="2">Perttu Pohjola managed to coach Apilan Pallosalama into a fierce condition in the midsummer.</seg>
<seg id="3">It trotted only first and second places, until it collapsed in the end of July in Tampere harness race.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since the stallion was completely exhausted, the trainer thought there is something wrong with it and reserved a vet appointment for his charge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The explanation for exhaustion was found after a viewing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The horse had laryngitis.</seg>
<seg id="7">The disease was not the mildest possible, but required two courses of medication before it was conquered.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since Apilan Pallosalama had to be restricted to light exercise, Pohjola says he is positively surprised about the horse’s last run.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Turku it trotted a record time and was second after the Finland’s best, mare Taruntuuli.</seg>
<seg id="10">Apilan Pallosalama was quite energetic after the break, since it could have been trained normally only for some weeks.</seg>
<seg id="11">Taking all of this into consideration, it is understandable that there was a drop towards the end, says Pohjola.</seg>
<seg id="12">The trainer supposes that a proper competition did the stallion good.</seg>
<seg id="13">The shape of the horse progressed surely, and hopefully it also balanced.</seg>
<seg id="14">Apilan Pallosalama is a so called humorous horse.</seg>
<seg id="15">When it hasn’t felt up to it, it might’ve stopped trying even without sickness.</seg>
<seg id="16">Instead on a good day the stallion has had such a lightning spurt that the competitors have been amazed.</seg>
<seg id="17">The competitors are not a match in short distance speed to Pallosalama, who can run almost in a thoroughbred kind of way.</seg>
<seg id="18">Pohjola hopes for a slipstream run at Vermo.</seg>
<seg id="19">But it is a whole different thing how Apilan Pallosalama feels about that.</seg>
<seg id="20">It can be pretty tricky during the start, and might for example sneak under the boom of the start car or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope the stallion would be more calm than in Turku.</seg>
<seg id="22">When Apilan Pallosalama is in condition, it can also come from the front and we will race to win, promises the trainer.</seg>

<seg id="3">At least part of the applications that come with Apple iPhones can possibly be removed sometime in the future - but not all of them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Apple is possibly going to remove some of their own applications from iPhones in the future, says the company CEO, Tim Cook, in an interview for Buzzfeed.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is a bunch of applications in Apple iPhone that relatively few have use of: For example FaceTime calls, Newsstand, Health, Stocks, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">The latest addition to these applications is Apple Watch, which was an obligatory update to iPhones, even though it is necessary only those who own Apple Watch.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Cook, removing Apple applications is a more complex issue than it first appears.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are some apps that are linked to something else on the iPhone.</seg>
<seg id="9">If they were to be removed they might cause issues elsewhere on the phone, Cook states to Buzzfeed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Cook did not mention which of Apple iPhone applications function closely with other applications.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are other apps that aren’t like that.</seg>
<seg id="12">So over time, I think we can figure out a way to let the user remove them, said Cook.</seg>

<seg id="1">The United States’ Fed will next attempt to tighten the monetary policy</seg>
<seg id="2">The next recession in the United States will begin in its quickest in less than a year, but more likely within three years after the country’s central bank Fed will begin to raise its interests after a long period.</seg>
<seg id="3">And as for the decline in the financial markets, it will begin before the next recession.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fed has hinted at beginning the rate hikes possibly already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.</seg>
<seg id="5">That means the next recession can be here as soon as by next autumn and the financial markets’ rate crash before tat.</seg>
<seg id="6">Or at least that will happen, if the largest economy in the world and the financial markets function in the same way as before - and if they react to Fed’s financial limitations the same way as before.</seg>
<seg id="7">These are the conclusions the London market research strategists of German Deutsche Bank Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Parker came to in their study of long-term market and economy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bank distributed the study report of over 60-pages, Long-Term Asset Return Study, to their international major customers last week.</seg>
<seg id="9">The strategists who created the study and the report do not try to make anyone believe that they know exactly when the Fed will begin to raise its interests or what happens after that in economy and markets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Instead they demonstrate how the economy and the markets have previously behaved during and after Fed interest hikes, using cool facts and calculations.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to historical observations they also analyse which essential variables of economy and the financial markets are now on the same or different level than during earlier interest hikes - and what are the possible implications.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is evident that both the economy and the financial markets are now weaker to withstand a rate hike than ever before since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="13">Perhaps a less than a year to a recession</seg>
<seg id="14">The leaders deciding on Fed's monetary policy and its prevailing setting have during last summer and early autumn hinted that the time might be ripe to raise the rates.</seg>
<seg id="15">The first rate hike in over nine years can come already this week.</seg>
<seg id="16">The matter is settled during Wednesday and Thursday, as the Fed board's so called open market committee convenes for its two-day meeting to decide on the matter.</seg>
<seg id="17">The previous time Fed raised its so called Fed funds key interest rate was in June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="18">That marked the end of two years of series of relatively regular but minor 0.25 percentage point rate hikes that the Fed used to raise its interest from 1.25 to 5.25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="19">The symptoms of the financial markets began in 2007 with difficulties in the most high-risk housing financing, and a year later the financial crisis widened to a global doomsday nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="20">The great recession arrived in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="21">The last time serious adversities of financial markets and real economy began slower than what has been typical after earlier Fed interest hikes.</seg>
<seg id="22">In proportion, the adversities were harder and harsher than since the 1930s depression.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Deutsche strategists have screened the upturns and downfalls of the greatest economies in the world as well as the changes in the financial markets since 1950, for some parts even from the beginning of the 19th century onwards.</seg>
<seg id="24">They report Fed's rate hikes and their economic and financial impacts since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="25">The recession has begun the quickest in less than a year after the first rate hike, most of the time in less than three years, and on average in less than three and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="26">The increase in prices in the financial markets has ended within a year or two after Fed interest hikes have begun.</seg>
<seg id="27">Fed has alternated between rising and reducing their key interest rate since the beginning of the 1950s in dozen cycles of different length.</seg>
<seg id="28">Each time has, for some parts, varied from others, and there are relatively little occasions in the examination, so it is hardly possible to reach any certain conclusions about the impacts of the next rate hikes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The strategists remind us that this time many things are different.</seg>
<seg id="30">And not just better.</seg>
<seg id="31">Interest have been too low for too long</seg>
<seg id="32">The pivotal factors contributing to, not to mention the culprits for the financial crisis cannot necessarily be unquestionably discovered even with decades of research.</seg>
<seg id="33">But there are three circumstances leading to the crisis and increasing its destructive power that are clear somewhat beyond doubt:</seg>
<seg id="34">1) Fed, European Central Bank ECB and other largest central banks of the world held their key interest rates on a too low a level for too long a time in the 2000s.</seg>
<seg id="35">They were patching the marks left by the techno bubble and at the same time stoking up the next.</seg>
<seg id="36">2) The size of a debt of different parts of financial and real economies, accumulated over decades and already too large, grew even larger because of the overly lax monetary policy of the central banks.</seg>
<seg id="37">The so far largest debt bubble in the economic history was created.</seg>
<seg id="38">3) The madly cheap debt funding, packed especially to financial economy almost without restraints, inflated the largest rate bubbles in the so far economic history for most of the sectors of financial markets, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will probably be no severe arguments either about the fact that the financial markets that have increased to heights due to more and more complicated debt leverage were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state the last time Fed and other central banks increased the rates.</seg>
<seg id="40">Neither the financial structures set up with debt leverage nor evaluation bubbles did last but a certain time after the rate hikes had begun and the costs of debt funding had started to rise.</seg>
<seg id="41">The risks were materialised as a financial crisis, and a great recession followed.</seg>
<seg id="42">A bigger bubble and more debt</seg>
<seg id="43">The Deutsche Bank strategists will not guess what happens next, but they give us food for thought by mentioning for instance the following facts:</seg>
<seg id="44">1) Fed and other large central banks have now held their monetary policy setting even lighter and even longer than before the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the interest rates were too low for a long time before the crisis, they now have been even lower for even longer.</seg>
<seg id="46">2) Incurring of a debt has not, for a long time, been as madly cheap as it was ten years ago, but debt money is now literally cheaper than free at its cheapest.</seg>
<seg id="47">That way the debt load of financial and real economies has not lightened, but the different parts of economy are churning under a considerably heavier debt load than before the financial crisis, or for that matter, ever before.</seg>
<seg id="48">3) The liquidity from the central banks that has started off cheaper and more fast-flowing than before has mostly stayed at the financial markets and has dragged the key types of securities and properties to their highest peak since before the financial crisis or ever.</seg>
<seg id="49">And the strategists are killing the mood not only with the warning signs of financial markets, but also by noting that not even the United States’ economy has recovered yet from the financial crisis and the heaviest recession in decades like it earlier has.</seg>
<seg id="50">The euro area has recovered barely at all.</seg>
<seg id="51">In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but respectively the pressure and risks of the financial markets are clearly larger than before the financial crisis, as Fed will next start to cut off their money.</seg>
<seg id="52">Maybe the outlook of Albert Edwards, a strategist from a French bank Societe Generale, is not as weird as it may seem at a first glance.</seg>
<seg id="53">For quite some time now, he has coached the international investor customers as to the Fed’s next reversal:</seg>
<seg id="54">First they raise the interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon it is time for Fed to hasten to put out the financial fires with even bigger QE money hoses.</seg>

<seg id="2">The new operating system can be requested by heading to the Settings app, tapping "General," and then selecting "Software Update."</seg>
<seg id="3">If it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some have run into problems after that installation, being hit by an error message telling them that "Software update failed."</seg>
<seg id="5">To get around that, users are recommended either to wait for the rush to die down, or to try and upgrade through iTunes.</seg>
<seg id="6">The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.</seg>
<seg id="7">That might include deleting apps to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by slimming down the update, and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest apps to delete and then re-install them once the process is over.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a charger while the update happens, so that it doesn't run out of battery.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to Yle, the Minister of Transport and Communications (Centre), Anne Berner, has served on the board of a tax haven firm.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Yle, the company’s operations involve so called tax planning.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company in question is Saltri II LuxCo from Luxembourg, and Berner joined the board in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the Luxembourg register of companies she still remains on the board.</seg>
<seg id="6">Berner herself says she has already given notice of her resignation in May this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">" looked into the matter and it’s enough that I have handed in my resignation.</seg>
<seg id="8">It’s almost impossible to manage and control that everything is in the right register in time, Berner says in Yle’s interview.</seg>
<seg id="9">Member after a merger</seg>
<seg id="10">The company in Luxembourg is used to manage the holdings of a Swedish Kährs company.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kährs is a flooring company who merged with the Finnish flooring company Karelia-Upofloor already in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="12">Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upofloor between 2010 and 2013, and after the merger she served on board of Kährs as well as the company from Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Yle, Kährs’ holdings go through a complicated ownership structure in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id="14">Berner said to Yle that she accepted the board position in the Luxembourgian company by request of the Kährs’ second largest owner.</seg>
<seg id="15">This owner is Hartwall Capital.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have served on board of Karelia-Upofloor owned by Hartwall Capital.</seg>
<seg id="17">The company was looking for a partner in cooperation, which was found in Sweden.</seg>
<seg id="18">This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id="19">I felt my duty was to protect shareholders in the Finnish family firm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is important that we ensure our Finnish companies’ capital gains are taxed in Finland, and that premise was secured in this context, Berner says.</seg>
<seg id="21">Berner said to Yle that there is no tax planning involved in Hartwall Capital ownerships.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to Berner, the complicated ownership structure in a tax haven only exists because Kährs’ biggest owner, investment company Triton, already had a holding company in Luxembourg for ownership.</seg>

<seg id="1">STTK is preparing an optional competitiveness package</seg>
<seg id="2">STTK will begin to prepare an optional package for the Government’s tightening of working life conditions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The organisation hopes that also other labour market organisations will contribute.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the chairman, Antti Palola, at this moment their attention is on this Friday’s demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="5">Alternative methods of lowering the cost of work will be discussed again after that.</seg>
<seg id="6">Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday, said Palola to reporters while on a break from a meeting organised by the organisations management.</seg>
<seg id="7">Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) has no readiness for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The economists of STTK have calculated that the change security included in the Government’s competitiveness package will cost about 30 million euros to employers, when the other side of the package is 2.700 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">I do not know, if a party is that excited in taking part in discussions, if they are on the receiving end with a ratio of one to hundred.</seg>
<seg id="10">Palola: Constructive dialogue</seg>
<seg id="11">Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) has hoped to receive alternative proposals by Wednesday, because the Government is then due to give a statement about their own package to the Parliament, and to begin the preparation for the reform.</seg>
<seg id="12">Palola did not take a stand on whether the schedule is realistic or not.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Palola, there exists a dialogue with the Government, and he thinks it has been constructive the whole time.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Palola, especially Sunday pay cut is a sore issue for the Finnish Confederation of Professionals (STTK).</seg>
<seg id="15">The organisation requires that the Government retreats from mandatory legislation it plans to use in implementing part of the package.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to Palola, STTK does not warm to the idea of preparing an alternative package together with SDP who have raised the issue.</seg>
<seg id="17">The salary earners will meet in Helsinki on Friday to protest against the competitiveness package introduced last week by the Government.</seg>
<seg id="18">As part of the package, the pay for the first sick leave days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be reduced to 75 per cent and the holidays will be shortened.</seg>
<seg id="19">STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited salary earners to a demonstration, and the goal has not been to arrange a strike.</seg>
<seg id="20">Commendations from Akava’s Fjäder</seg>
<seg id="21">Akava President Sture Fjäder acknowledges STTK’s announcement about preparing an alternative package.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to Fjäder, STTK now aligns with Akava, for Akava has already for some time drafted an alternative model for the Government’s proposals.</seg>
<seg id="23">Fjäder hopes that also SAK takes part in the alternative package, because without SAK, the package is not inclusive enough.</seg>

<seg id="3">We want change security and working time banks.</seg>
<seg id="4">Akava reported on Wednesday that it has for already a long time been preparing its own proposal to negotiate the country’s government’s aim of five percent competitiveness leap as an alternative to cuts.</seg>
<seg id="5">Akava has been willing to negotiate the whole time, and we have already for a long time been writing an alternative model for the government’s proposals.</seg>
<seg id="6">We are ready to consider conditions of employment as part of the deal.</seg>
<seg id="7">In return we want change security and working time banks, say the President Sture Fjäder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fjäder hopes that also SAK would think on similar terms with Akava, like STTK already did on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">Without SAK the package is not strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="10">Together we will now prepare a model that is acceptable to the government and to employers, says Fjäder.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Green Left in the University of Tampere, Viva, has a bingo coupon for tonight.</seg>
<seg id="4">Earlier the Prime Ministers have given special speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and the wars.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Prime Minister Juha Sipilä extremely exceptionally will address the nation about the state of Finnish economy on Yle channels on Wednesday evening 9.05 PM.</seg>
<seg id="6">When looking for a similar Prime Minister’s speech, we have to go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, while being the Prime Minister, gave a famous broadcasted speech that meant the beginning of the end for Mäntsälä rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="7">After that, the President and the ministers gave several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation Wars.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave the New Year’s speech instead of the President Mauno Koivisto, but that was more related to ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the autumn 1976, president Urho Kekkonen brought an end to the train dispatcher strike with a televised speech.</seg>
<seg id="10">Soliloquy, monarchist pursuit</seg>
<seg id="11">During the whole day, Sipilä’s speech has invited criticism and guesses about what is to come.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Left Alliance leader Paavo Arhinmäki said via Twitter that “Sipilä could make his speech about the situation of the nation also in the parliament as a Prime Minister’s announcement, which would allow for discussion.”</seg>
<seg id="13">According to Ville Niinistö from Green League, “we have already seen soliloquy”.</seg>
<seg id="14">Dialogue and listening to people are part of being a leader.</seg>
<seg id="15">Erkki Tuomioja of the Social Democratic Party judged in Facebook that “this is a monarchist pursuit: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them”.</seg>
<seg id="16">The leader of the Social Democratic Party Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to a dialogue: “It has been almost six months since the election.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Prime Minister has not once appeared in the media with the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have tried.</seg>
<seg id="19">What is @juhasipila afraid of?</seg>
<seg id="20">Public service</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the speech has been recorded beforehand, and it lasts about 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions, SAK, it will be commented live by the SAK President Lauri Lyly and the Director General of the Confederation of Finnish Industries Jyri Häkämies.</seg>
<seg id="23">Yle has been criticised for broadcasting Sipilä’s speech.</seg>
<seg id="24">We considered the matter and found that it is part of the task for a public service to promote the publicity countrywide publicity, declared Yle Director of Media Ismo Silvo for Yle news.</seg>
<seg id="25">Like in the 60s</seg>
<seg id="26">The speech has also provoked taunts.</seg>
<seg id="27">“When the evening comes, dinner is eaten early, and the children are washed and dressed in their Sunday best.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mother changes into a prettier frock and father puts a tie around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="29">At nine o’clock the family then quietens down in front of the television, as if a TV series family of yore”, writes blogger Saku Timonen.</seg>
<seg id="30">“In his speech, will the Prime Minister Sipilä also tell why there are millionaires hiding their funds in tax paradises sitting in the Finnish government, creating acts of indemnity to their tax evader pals and, at the same time, arguing to people that we must cut becuase the country has no money left?”, asks Pia Lohikoski.</seg>
<seg id="31">One guess about what Sipilä will say is presented by Viva, the Green Left in the University of Tampere.</seg>
<seg id="32">It has published the herewith bingo in Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="33">Will we hear about the same boat, common goal, living on credit and team spirit tonight?</seg>
<seg id="34">Ready your coupons and pens, it begins at 9.05 PM from the channels TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ahtisaari for the Guardian: The West ignored Russian offer to have al-Assad step aside</seg>
<seg id="2">More than three years ago the West ignored Russian offer to have Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, says President Martti Ahtisaari for the Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador for the UN laid out a plan, which included having al-Assad elegantly cede power after some time.</seg>
<seg id="4">The western countries did not grasp the proposal, though, since they thought al-Assad would fall anyway in a few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ahtisaari held talks about the Syrian crisis with five permanent members of the UN security council in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that in a private conversation, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, laid out a three-point plan: we should not give arms to the opposition, we should get dialogue going between the opposition and al-Assad straight away, and we should find an elegant way for al-Assad to step aside.</seg>
<seg id="7">I know Churkin.</seg>
<seg id="8">We do not necessarily agree on all issues but we can talk candidly.</seg>
<seg id="9">I explained what I was doing there and he said: “Martti, sit down and I’ll tell you what we should do”, Ahtisaari recalls in the Guardian interview.</seg>
<seg id="10">No comments from the diplomats</seg>
<seg id="11">Ahtisaari says he passed Churkin’s message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.</seg>
<seg id="12">Churkin did not confirm the contents of the discussion to the newspaper, but according to Ahtisaari there is no question about it.</seg>
<seg id="13">The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari’s claim, but pointed out that during that time, al-Assad’s forces had already carried out multiple massacres, and the main opposition groups refused to accept any proposal that left him in power.</seg>
<seg id="14">Britain’s former director of the Middle East department of the Foreign Office, Sir John Jenkins, is hesitant about Ahtisaari’s claims, since in his experience, Russia was at no stage prepared to discuss al-Assad’s fate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Officially Russia has supported al-Assad during the whole war.</seg>
<seg id="16">The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s claim is that Churkin would have been speaking with Moscow’s authority.</seg>
<seg id="17">I think if he had told me what Churkin had said, I would have replied I wanted to hear it from President Vladimir Putin too before I could take it seriously.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Jenkins, he would have even then suspected that it was a Putin trick to keep an al-Assad supporter in power.</seg>
<seg id="19">The flow of refugees is our own doing</seg>
<seg id="20">At the time of Ahtisaari's talks, the death toll from the Syrian conflict was about 7.500.</seg>
<seg id="21">The UN believes that toll passed 220,000 at the beginning of this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Over 11 million people have been forced out of their homes because of the war.</seg>
<seg id="23">We should have prevented this disaster from happening.</seg>
<seg id="24">This flow of refugees to Europe is our own doing.</seg>
<seg id="25">I do not see any other option but to take good care of these poor people.</seg>
<seg id="26">We are now paying the bills we have caused ourselves, states Ahtisaari to the newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2">Government-planned asylum seeker registration centre to Northern Finland will most likely be established to Tornio.</seg>
<seg id="3">The centre is planned to be set up in an empty Tornio yhteislyseo school building in the town centre.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Ministry of the Interior has been searching for a suitable place, in order to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Tuesday, Helsingin Sanomat reported that the council would have already decided to propose the school building as a space solution for the Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the vice-chair of Tornio town council, Sauli Hyöppinen (Left) this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the whole council was not present and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to call for a council meeting for next Monday to decide on the matter, he clarified to STT.</seg>
<seg id="8">There were 36 of the 43 delegates present in the discussion gathering.</seg>
<seg id="9">The registration centre was opposed by 13 delegates.</seg>
<seg id="10">Based on this, the decision can be expected to be positive, Hyöppinen says.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the Mayor, Timo Nousiainen, the town received a contact about the matter on Monday, and they were quick to react.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is estimated that the school building would house 500 asylum seekers at a time.</seg>
<seg id="13">An expert has checked that the building could be suitable for this kind of use.</seg>
<seg id="14">The location is about 200 metres from the border, so it would be functional also in that sense, says Nousiainen.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sipilä still hopes the labour market to present an option for tightening conditions</seg>
<seg id="2">According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre), the halving of holiday pay that has been in the public eye would only take care of one part of the Government’s attempt to lower the price of work.</seg>
<seg id="3">He says that the Government is happy to receive an alternative package though, if the labour market organisations manage to agree on one.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sipilä told the journalists in the parliament that he has not been in contact with the labour market organisations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Neither did he know how serious the organisations are in their search for replacement tools for tightening working life conditions the government announced.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this agreement is created, we are most definitely happy to receive it as part of the whole package.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Sipilä halving the holiday pay would be an effective tool, since it would target nearly all the salary earners, instead of for example the Sunday pay cut the government is planning.</seg>
<seg id="8">The labour market organisations could agree on the holiday pay cuts among themselves, since they are written into the collective labour agreements instead of a law.</seg>
<seg id="9">For now it seems that the Government will give a statement to Parliament about the tightening working life conditions on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Sipilä, the organisations’ proposals should be available before this.</seg>
<seg id="11">But even this is not the final deadline.</seg>
<seg id="12">Legislation process starts then, and when the train is moving, it gets harder all the time.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now there is still time.</seg>
<seg id="14">These things do not take long if there is a will, worded Sipilä.</seg>
<seg id="15">The list published last week by the Government includes for example changing Epiphany and Ascension Day into unpaid days off without shortening annual working hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">Additionally, the pay for the first sick leave days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be reduced to 75 per cent and the holidays will be shortened.</seg>
<seg id="17">The reforms will be carried out through mandatory legislation, past the labour organisations, which has attracted strong criticism.</seg>
<seg id="18">The labour market organisations organise a big demonstration on Friday to protest these actions, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political strikes.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tohmajärvi council unanimously, but slightly grudgingly, approved the Nordic Koivu Ltd. hall, also known as the sap hall, warehouse expansion.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that the project is larger and more expensive than originally planned caused criticism.</seg>
<seg id="4">The busy schedule also irritated.</seg>
<seg id="5">The council slightly wondered how this need for space was not known a year ago, when the previous expansion was approved.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this stage, the warehouse expansion of 400-450 square metres was accepted as part of the investment programme, but the financial side will be approved later in the interim report.</seg>
<seg id="7">The agenda still mentioned an investment of 150,000 to 200,000 euros, but in the meeting the technical manager Erkki Ikonen stated that the cost will be about 300,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="8">The investment was supported on the ground that it brings work and tax revenue to the area.</seg>
<seg id="9">The municipality has no risk, because the company will pay for the investment as rent, reasoned Vesa Väistö (Finns party).</seg>

<seg id="1">A place also for Karelian language in Joensuu</seg>
<seg id="2">The city board toned down its previous intransigent position on bringing street name signs in Karelian language to the centre of Joensuu.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new decision is important and right, when considering continuing the Karelian tradition in the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="4">Joensuu is not proclaiming itself to be the capital of Karelian language, since the claim does not have historical grounds, and Karelian language is not a natural part of the area’s identity.</seg>
<seg id="5">The language spoken in the Joensuu area is more part of the eastern Savonian dialects.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even after the new decision there will be no street signs in Karelian language to be found from the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="7">The city of Joensuu is, however, on a case-by-case basis and with careful though also ready to use Karelian language in for instance information boards and tourism marketing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city recommends the same attitude for all the other operators, as well.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even though officially Joensuu is a monolingual town, we should be open in our approach also to Karelian language users now that multiculturalism is alive and strongly transforming also in North Karelia.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Karelian language is still one of the characteristics of the region, as is the idea of Joensuu being the forest capital of whole Finland.</seg>
<seg id="11">These both can well be utilised in various marketing in the region.</seg>

<seg id="2">The train cuts strike straight to the vitality of the region.</seg>
<seg id="3">The train connections have a direct effect on the industrial life and competitiveness of the region.</seg>
<seg id="4">And this again has an effect on whether it is even possible to live and work here, wonders the mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen.</seg>
<seg id="5">He also highlights the air travel, the continuation of which has several times been at issue.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is vital for the whole region that our chances to survive are not diminished by the actions of the authorities, as it is now happening.</seg>
<seg id="7">The effect of reducing these connections on for example the employment situation should be discussed, emphasises Karjalainen.</seg>
<seg id="8">The deterioration of connections causes extra challenges to the University of Eastern Finland as to its attractiveness.</seg>
<seg id="9">Naturally, the better the services like traffic connections and access to housing, the easier it is to find students and staff, states the rector of the University of Eastern Finland, Jukka Mönkkönen.</seg>
<seg id="10">He notes that the poor accessibility also has an impact to the researchers, who have a high mobility and travel a lot because of their research.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of student recruitment, Marko Junkkarinen, says that already now it is difficult to market the university in the Western Finland, since the transverse connections are poor.</seg>
<seg id="12">About half of the students in the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.</seg>
<seg id="13">From these students, about 10-20 per cent come from Uusimaa, whichc is partly explained with the direct train connection.</seg>

<seg id="1">FedEx earnings mixed, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx reported disappointing results for its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="4">At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday's opening bell.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said that it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, down 20 cents from an earlier prediction.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.</seg>
<seg id="8">The reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes averaging 4.9 percent, which will take effect Jan. 4, and higher surcharges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages, which begin in November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and growth in online commerce.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was "performing solidly given weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."</seg>
<seg id="11">The holiday-hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said that that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same that it hired last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, short of the $2.44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the latest quarter, ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates, while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs.</seg>
<seg id="20">In premarket trading about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares were down $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.</seg>
<seg id="21">They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.</seg>

<seg id="1">At their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table deciding if it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">Looming over them at one end of the central bank's ornate, two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above all others.</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank has a dual charge from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there's an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And that third mandate could be the X-factor in a too-close-to-predict decision, to be announced Thursday, about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being weaned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even though most data show the economy growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-cautious Fed officials skittish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There's no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing financial market jitters.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">Financial markets, however, are expecting the Fed to hold off, with a key indicator showing only about a 30% chance of a boost.</seg>
<seg id="13">That would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate, unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point in time," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If Fed policymakers did, "they would have to go to great lengths in their policy statement to hold financial markets' hands so they don't panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would validate the strength of the U.S. recovery.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been solid this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.</seg>
<seg id="24">And although inflation continued to run below the central bank's annual 2% target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But financial markets around the world started convulsing late last month after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% from the May high.</seg>
<seg id="29">For Fed policymakers, the market turmoil adds to the complex calculus of when to raise the interest rate.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks, they would be tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy are going to be, and they have almost no data to rely on that post-dates the developments in China," Oliner said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the global economy isn't one of the Fed's primary concerns, so technically it shouldn't be factored into its decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But, in effect, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "taper" its monetary expansion triggered market convulsions around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that seem unconnected to economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase, cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point over three meetings "despite limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market meltdown, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latest turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"You certainly don't want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think they should get ahead of the curve.</seg>

<seg id="7">Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's finale</seg>

<seg id="11">It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut.</seg>

<seg id="2">Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.</seg>
<seg id="6">Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death toll.</seg>
<seg id="8">The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dilute their political influence.</seg>
<seg id="9">There have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic Tharus who want their own state.</seg>
<seg id="10">At least 40 people, including 11 police officials, have been killed in violent clashes since Aug.</seg>
<seg id="11">10, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.</seg>
<seg id="13">Lawmakers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said that the new charter could be enacted by Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="8">The donations will go toward four nonprofit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</seg>

<seg id="1">For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's still to early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments, however.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data take a long time to show up," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight loss operations, or bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, bariatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies were done in people who are morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the BMI among those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those who had surgery, diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medically-treated group, by comparison, diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.</seg>
<seg id="19">After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medical therapy group, however, it remained steady at about 8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected by the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved larger drops in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and in hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Though the new study didn't show a benefit in survival among surgery patients, Blackstone said it's reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is where this paper is critical, because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BMI group," with no increased risk of death or renal disease, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that once they've accumulated these genetic changes that hardwired their bodies into obesity and diabetes, reversing that is really hard.</seg>

<seg id="2">Europe could not host all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees" home countries.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="5">He claimed that, under current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also stressed that, however admirable, the West-European countries" response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">"So taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring genuine peace and genuine development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">We have to reduce the use of force.</seg>
<seg id="12">The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.</seg>
<seg id="13">Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US" violent response engendered a chain of uncontrollable events.</seg>
<seg id="14">After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-violence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fourfold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in last 4 years</seg>
<seg id="2">Poison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent uptick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing highly-alcoholic hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, hand sanitizer ingestion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Kids are getting into these products more frequently, and unfortunately, there's a percentage of them going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said some kids are drinking sanitizer intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or on a social-media dare.</seg>
<seg id="6">Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking sanitizer for a cheap buzz.</seg>
<seg id="7">Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink.</seg>
<seg id="8">Younger children can be drawn to attractive sanitizer scents.</seg>
<seg id="9">"A kid is not thinking this is bad for them," Lopez said.</seg>
<seg id="10">A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">In young children, especially, only a few squirts can cause alcohol poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.</seg>
<seg id="15">So you wouldn't leave a shot of whiskey sitting around, but people will have these hand sanitizers out and if kids get into it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested as many as four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her blood-alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could have been very lethal for my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes short of moving hand sanitizer out of a child's reach.</seg>
<seg id="23">Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="25">Health officials surmised that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their "mean" teacher "by putting antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.</seg>
<seg id="27">The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room.</seg>
<seg id="28">Police considered the foiled plan to be "idle chatter," referring discipline to the school district.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why I'm A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death.</seg>
<seg id="3">If it happens, and I hope it won't, I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation was first made back in January, via his best friend, and though I was shocked, I agreed.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the day approaches, I've come to dread it.</seg>
<seg id="7">So why do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would offer a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">True, journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately.</seg>
<seg id="13">I cannot do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls, and one visit lasting two-and-a-half hours.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the guy.</seg>
<seg id="16">We often laugh a lot when we talk.</seg>
<seg id="17">The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I will just have to try to remember all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here's the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I complained to her.</seg>
<seg id="23">She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but still thinks I'm wrong to do what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip has taken issue with some of the things I've said and written.</seg>
<seg id="25">He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.</seg>
<seg id="26">I've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="28">If he dies, he thinks the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be alongside me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.</seg>
<seg id="31">I won't go over all the details again here.</seg>
<seg id="32">I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being an accessory after the fact.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And it's from this perspective that I will watch him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot claim to be truly objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.</seg>
<seg id="40">What you will get from me is what it's like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death.</seg>

<seg id="2">Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately.</seg>
<seg id="3">He took aim at stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lidari's positive swab to cobalt, which he can not explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn't want it "to look like sour grapes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once," Moody said.</seg>
<seg id="7">They know it went on.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said.</seg>
<seg id="9">I will go home tonight and sleep well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">When they start to think I'm not that's when I shouldn't be a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would then have to consider what I do with my licence.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earlier, Moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stables to offer information on what I was doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.</seg>
<seg id="15">They obviously believe I'm a cheat.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that's the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they've been incompetent in trying to catch me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Should that make me think it's becoming personal?</seg>
<seg id="19">Has RVL got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry?</seg>
<seg id="20">Am I bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">Am I that bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe people out there think I am.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I've got no doubt what I'm saying now might make them think about that.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I've got to the point now where I don't care and that saddens me.</seg>
<seg id="25">That really saddens me.</seg>
<seg id="26">I will put the pressure on them and onus on them to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trainer's frustration levels have built with the long-running cobalt inquiry involving Lidari and the late scratching had him saying that he could "throw my licence across the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Moody, best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black Caviar, labelled the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice had been applied to the horses legs, which is against the rules.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's against the rules of racing.</seg>
<seg id="31">I've got to accept full responsibility for that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg.</seg>
<seg id="33">It could have had it last night.</seg>
<seg id="34">It could have had it yesterday, which it did have.</seg>
<seg id="35">It had it on race day.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the race day treatment using the poultice, which stewards have opened an inquiry into.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is a joke.</seg>
<seg id="38">People making these rules know nothing about the horse.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his side's tackling as "agenda setting" by the NRL's two premiership favourites.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to "wrestle" his side during the Storm's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm after his side's qualifying final win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called that game a "showcase" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland weren't "too big" into wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended his side's tackling and said they just focused on their "contact" when tackling.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added he took confidence from having two leading coaches criticise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee we haven't changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques, it's just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackles and that has been the turn around for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne is talking about exciting footy.</seg>
<seg id="13">He made a point of comparing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a rat's arse.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting footy, especially his young halves with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made that point in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of footy - not every team has two halves like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.</seg>
<seg id="18">To me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking of us when they get to the big games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet but what was the score? 16-12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game it was 20-18, there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting footy?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting?</seg>
<seg id="24">To me it's agendas.</seg>
<seg id="25">If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night's preliminary final at AAMI Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="2">A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled into Queensland has been granted bail on a $200,000 surety.</seg>
<seg id="3">Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked at Coomera in August.</seg>
<seg id="4">Maksimovic was observed meeting with his co-accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose.</seg>
<seg id="6">Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Maksimovic was a flight risk.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has clear connections to Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="8">He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the crown case he lied to police about where he was staying.</seg>
<seg id="10">Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a surety of $200,000 to secure his release.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Having read the affidavits of both those persons, it is clear that the imposition of a surety of $200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear, he warned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Maksimovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police on a daily basis and adheres to a 6pm-6am curfew.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stevan Hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images</seg>
<seg id="2">A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit child abuse images.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as she slept then logged into an online messaging service where he had a succession of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.</seg>
<seg id="4">The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hogg's hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">She looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately alerting her mother.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police attended and saw the five pictures, then analysed computers found at the address and discovered "concerning" web searches using terms for finding indecent image of children.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hogg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would "lead paedophiles" on the internet before "pretending he was a police officer to scare them."</seg>
<seg id="8">Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.</seg>
<seg id="9">He accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said he was doing it to lure them in.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying.</seg>
<seg id="14">She saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted.</seg>
<seg id="15">The girl was interviewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making indecent images of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Defence solicitor Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was "no significant sexual element" to his crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentence until October for social work background reports.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases.</seg>
<seg id="20">He was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of his sentencing date.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a podium.</seg>
<seg id="3">He was unhurt, but video of the fall went viral on social media.</seg>
<seg id="4">The opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mr Mugabe during his address.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last month, they booed and heckled him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.</seg>

<seg id="7">"The message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it's titled 'death'," he told journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate.</seg>

<seg id="1">Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, providing his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">That best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and, given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship is clearly uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre-season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This kind of injury is not career-threatening," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a bone that did not heal well.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is nothing major.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">That might be true from a purely medical perspective but, as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return midseason.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is also an uncomfortable pattern developing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Research by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games during the last five seasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08, they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes, when you are coming back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to get over that.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body stabilises, I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">With Arsenal beginning their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger may also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to keep the balance and give a little breather to players who need it," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most intimidating.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dinamo are also unbeaten in 41 matches after producing their own "Invincible" campaign last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earth tremor that measured 3.2 on the Richter.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger believes that Arsenal have learnt the lesson of last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This drive is immense," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has never been done at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were very close in 2006 but, on the other hand, I am long enough to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship</seg>
<seg id="2">The absence of similar portrayals in shows is glaring, particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever, with suicide rates amongst young males at 15 year high.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in males than females.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a bid to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Male, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students displaying depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of "healthy mood" friends, their chances of recovering doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Equally, for those not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the chances of mental challenges arising.</seg>
<seg id="8">But of course, for friendship to work, it needs to be accessible in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this age of social-media led communication, with its focus on style over substance, immediacy of response is often prioritised over meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality isolation is king.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists term extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply impacts our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">And as a billionaire video-game creator explained recently, money really doesn't buy greater happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each of the characters were not defined by their work, but rather their personalities, which shone through the interaction as friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football on the comfy chairs, and Ross's pining for Rachel, came from the knowledge that yes, men can all relate to this, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."my listening role to people feeling depressed and suicidal has really highlighted how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">Often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old adage of "getting on with it" is strong, as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems."</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term coping mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">It highlighted the little moments of male friendship.</seg>
<seg id="21">As much as my objective, outsider status over the phone helps people in moments of desperation, the long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friend network.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so, if you attend Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, with the sets fully redesigned in celebration, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, better still, if in Starbucks you see someone alone, give a smile and say hello.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what difference your friendship could make.</seg>
<seg id="25">Friends is broadcasting on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest</seg>

<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG ease past Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here's the match report and reaction to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way, but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cavani headed home in the 61st minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while they got the points, it was not a vintage display by Laurent Blanc's side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substituted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illustrious career back in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on," said Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="10">It augurs well.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we did, although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentina winger was labelled as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month, and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Verratti's pass in behind the Malmo defence before angling a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland and into the far corner of the net.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if anyone then expected PSG to romp to a big victory, they were to be disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, lined up with nine full internationals on the field at kick-off and, with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield, were stuffy opponents.</seg>
<seg id="16">But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG let themselves down at times with some wasteful passing and poor finishing, not least from Ibrahimovic, who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cavani just after the restart.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, he proved much more adept when it came to setting up his colleagues, and it was from an Ibrahimovic pass that Di Maria sent in a curling shot which was tipped around the post by Wiland on 52 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan heading home his sixth of the season after Ibrahimovic had flicked on a left-wing cross from Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">That ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game, and only a superb stop by Wiland from point-blank range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed right at the death.</seg>
<seg id="21">Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his side, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The qualifiers are not enough.</seg>
<seg id="24">Hats off to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a magnificent match from them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking</seg>
<seg id="2">Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn't needed behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="3">During Sunday night's episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen screenplay.</seg>
<seg id="4">"When we're talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show," Damon asserted.</seg>
<seg id="5">Shocked, Brown reacted with offended disbelief, letting out "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as The Martian actor's comments settled in the air.</seg>
<seg id="6">Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown initially said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The only black character who's a hooker who gets hit by her white pimp.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Dear White People producer pushed for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted their directing could "end up giving us something we don't want."</seg>
<seg id="10">After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval over Damon's comments.</seg>
<seg id="11">Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger toward the clip writing, "Matt Damon speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is SO WHITE it hurts."</seg>
<seg id="12">The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since being posted.</seg>
<seg id="13">Damon's comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion.</seg>
<seg id="14">After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took nationwide effect, urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color.</seg>
<seg id="15">In February, singer Prince alluded to the movement while introducing the nominees of Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Albums still matter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Like books and black lives, albums still matter.</seg>
<seg id="18">More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question of whether the group should be considered a hate group.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," leaders said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Damon was recently announced as one of a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's portrayal in the West.</seg>
<seg id="21">Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear.</seg>

<seg id="1">'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion</seg>
<seg id="2">Pro-rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win American Ninja Warrior Monday night taking home the $1 million grand prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">The competition show, which just wrapped up its 7th season, has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="5">The final task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="6">Britten went first completing the challenge on time, making him the first-ever athlete to complete American Ninja Warrior's grueling stage 4, however, Caldiero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner.</seg>
<seg id="7">Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-fought victory, still in shock about winning the $1 million grand prize.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I mean it's amazing to think about, like I've never made or lived off more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! of his serious pay-bump.</seg>
<seg id="9">So to all of a sudden...like I can't even imagine what it's going to be like...the future is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="10">Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why, despite Britten being the first ever competitor to finish the course, won't be awarded any prize money.</seg>
<seg id="11">By the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If there's more than one finisher, the one with the fastest time gets it," said Weed.</seg>
<seg id="13">As much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing, he does get the great gratification.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think he harbors any ill will about it.</seg>
<seg id="15">He's just so happy to have done what he's done.</seg>
<seg id="16">He's received tons of accolades from fans.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's such a great guy, and a family man.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's a hero to his kids and his wife.</seg>
<seg id="19">Geoff said to me, "If I was going to be beat by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."</seg>
<seg id="20">And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed.</seg>
<seg id="21">America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in Spring 2016.</seg>

<seg id="1">Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins</seg>
<seg id="2">MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.</seg>
<seg id="4">Reducing to being a spoiler, the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Twins squandered a chance to climb to within one-half game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that has been so elusive over much of the season's second half.</seg>
<seg id="7">"All wins are fun, no matter how it happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon made his early offensive support hold up, as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then tacked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was only his third quality start in his past nine outings.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I just want to finish strong this year," Simon said.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's hard for the bullpen to throw every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.</seg>
<seg id="13">Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.</seg>
<seg id="16">He looked good in (batting practice), looked noticeably better in BP, and he carried it right into the game.</seg>
<seg id="17">Trailing by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.</seg>
<seg id="18">Center fielder Byron Buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line.</seg>
<seg id="19">Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt single, and Simon got second baseman Brian Dozier to strike out swinging before being lifted for left-hander Blaine Hardy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Hardy walked Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel Sano, who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew VerHagen.</seg>
<seg id="21">With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was the major-league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit into a DP.</seg>
<seg id="23">After Detroit tacked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth, Mauer ripped an RBI double to the gap against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.</seg>
<seg id="25">Detroit took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes in the early going.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Obviously not the start I'd like to have," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."</seg>
<seg id="28">After getting the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.</seg>
<seg id="29">A two-out walk to right fielder J.D. Martinez brought up Victor Martinez, who singled up the middle for the first run of the game.</seg>
<seg id="30">Victor Martinez snapped his 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring position.</seg>
<seg id="31">Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third, ending the threat.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Tigers added on in the second, getting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="33">"That was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.</seg>
<seg id="34">He didn't hit it particularly well, but he got it in the right spot.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hughes, who was on a pitch count, pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.</seg>
<seg id="37">NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="38">He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on Sanchez's shoulder back in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="39">Sanchez, on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid-August, was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start.</seg>
<seg id="40">With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Norris will come off the DL to start against the Twins.</seg>
<seg id="41">Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for LHP David Price on July 30.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right oblique.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="44">Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will oppose Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).</seg>

<seg id="1">Xi urges to open economy wider to world</seg>
<seg id="2">The economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise, and improve opening-up policies," he said, addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.</seg>
<seg id="4">Promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vitality, and provide new room for economic growth, Xi said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access, relaxation of border-control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and overhauling the resident registration system.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the statement, a negative list, identifying sectors and businesses that are off-limits for investment, will be drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="7">The system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies, making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a bid to open up state-controlled sectors, more areas will be open to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment, and will protect the lawful interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits, or "green card," by optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process.</seg>
<seg id="14">Guaranteeing lawyers' right to practice and nurturing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="15">The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.</seg>
