<seg id="1">The social card of residents of Ivanovo region is to be recognised as an electronic payment instrument.</seg>
<seg id="2">These changes make allowances for the preservation of discounted travel on public transportation.</seg>
<seg id="3">Starting on September 24, the organisation of discounted travel for citizens of Ivanovo region using the social card will change.</seg>
<seg id="4">The press service for the Government of Russia for Ivanovo region reports that the changes make allowances for the preservation of discounted travel on public transportation and introduce a system of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 "On the National Payment System".</seg>
<seg id="5">Moreover, the social card of residents of Ivanovo region is to be recognised as an electronic payment instrument.</seg>
<seg id="6">Accordingly, the conditions of its use will change.</seg>
<seg id="7">For example, the loading limit is no longer set according to trips as before, but rather according to an amount of money; and the winter and summer periods will be maintained: in the winter, it will be no more than 400 roubles, and, in the summer, no more than 800 roubles for a given month.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, when they are issued a transit receipt, social card holders will need to keep track of the balance of funds on the card and not the number of remaining trips.</seg>
<seg id="9">The cost of discounted travel for citizens will amount to 1/2 the fare of the applicable carrier.</seg>
<seg id="10">The other half of the fare will be paid for from the regional budget.</seg>
<seg id="11">The schedule for topping up the social card with funds will stay the same: during the period between the 24th of the previous month through to the 23rd of the current month.</seg>
<seg id="12">The new procedure for travelling with a social card will have a number of advantages.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, it becomes possible to conduct detailed accounting of the expenditure of funds on the social card down to the last kopeck.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moreover, it becomes possible to refund loaded but unspent funds.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's also worth noting that the system of mutual settlements with carriers will become transparent, since a citizen now pays for half of the fare, and the carrier will be reimbursed in the exact same amount from the budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">No commission fee will be charged for loading funds onto the card.</seg>
<seg id="17">In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Public Roads and Transportation for Ivanovo region, reported that more than 33 million trips had been made using the social card in 2014, and, in 2015, almost 25 million trips.</seg>
<seg id="18">More than 470 million roubles have been set aside in the regional budget for the discounted travel of citizens using the social card.</seg>
<seg id="19">As of September 1, the total spent for this purpose amounted to more than 312 million roubles.</seg>

<seg id="1">In 911 Call, Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend</seg>
<seg id="2">In a 911 call, his voice only slightly shaky, college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb made a point to say his "sweet dog" was there alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the home, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad: "I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the day, there would be one more death: Lamb took his own life as police closed in on him.</seg>
<seg id="9">A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="10">The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Students said they looked forward to his class.</seg>
<seg id="12">Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History, which lists 17 faculty members, and many students took courses from both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, there were some inclinations of problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and jittery, "like there was something wrong with him."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, saying he had a health issue of some sort.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year, he was only teaching two online classes.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recent changes in the university's hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor.</seg>
<seg id="21">University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."</seg>
<seg id="22">Those are questions Lamb can no longer answer.</seg>
<seg id="23">After fleeing the campus, police later picked up Lamb's trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he could be apprehended, Lamb killed himself with a single .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="25">His car was still running in the driveway.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home, though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in the area.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.</seg>
<seg id="29">He received a doctorate in education in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar.</seg>
<seg id="33">He was quite the heartthrob back then.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the girls would melt when he was around," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no record of them ever marrying.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog named Lightning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a bayou in Gautier.</seg>
<seg id="38">Police said the dog was OK.</seg>
<seg id="39">Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who's now 19.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She and her mother were absolutely best friends.</seg>
<seg id="42">O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">Later, they played together in the occasional gig.</seg>
<seg id="45">O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss the night of Sept. 5, after Lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmonica for a sparse crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">There was no sign of anything amiss.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We were cutting up and throwing one-liners at each other.</seg>
<seg id="51">I mean, they both had a good sense of wit about them.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, the slain professor, directed the first-year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three young children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.</seg>
<seg id="55">On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."</seg>
<seg id="57">Classes resume Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is over.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is a day of healing.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lamb made the 911 call after shooting Schmidt, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call, there is no indication the two ever married.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to label him a flip-flopper.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others have dismissed him as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some are holding out for an implosion.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's lead at double digits, and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.</seg>
<seg id="8">None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pundits point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump's staying power and beginning to unload their dollars to topple him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July, it was 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In early August, it was 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view.</seg>
<seg id="19">And these numbers hold up in early states.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next closest in enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number holds in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters are getting used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When they put on their pundit hats, Republican voters think Trump is for real.</seg>
<seg id="34">When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll out last week.</seg>
<seg id="35">That's a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time last cycle, four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination, vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still, it shows that a plurality of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some pundits point out that the splintered field is likely contributing to Trump's lead, while anti-Trump support is be spread diffusely among more than a dozen other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that, in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always garners majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.</seg>
<seg id="43">He's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head.</seg>
<seg id="46">A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new CBS/NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes.</seg>
<seg id="48">Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say they would never change their mind.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech two months ago, immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are worried that Trump's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will remain too.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration with government is climbing to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters, largely due to their outsider status.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six in 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are angry at Washington, too.</seg>
<seg id="60">A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "mad as hell."</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets stated that the government is now looking at approaches to implementing the law on indexing pensions in 2016 to the real rate of inflation, reports Rossiyskaya Gazeta.</seg>
<seg id="3">She noted that a solution must be found by October 8: by the time the draft budget for next year is introduced in the government.</seg>

<seg id="5">He has called for "less theatre and more facts" at the weekly showpiece.</seg>
<seg id="6">He has also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and did recognise the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "irrespective" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are also "stacking up" within Labour following Mr Corbyn's appointment over its position on the European Union and the government's cap on benefits.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £26,000 to £23,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the despatch box over the past decade since he became Tory leader.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Islington North MP has said PMQs is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "repartee" and trading barbs, instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will deputise for him at PMQs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted some years later that he had failed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since it was first televised in 1990, PMQs has been seen as a key barometer of a leader's judgement, their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caricature and is in need of far-reaching reforms.</seg>

<seg id="2">The pound jumped following data showing a pick-up in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher by bid target SABMiller.</seg>
<seg id="3">Between May and July, UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.9% compared with the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="4">The rate was the fastest since 2009, and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro at €1.3730.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% to 6,229.21.</seg>
<seg id="7">SABMiller was the stand-out stock on the market, jumping 20% after it received a bid approach from rival AB InBev.</seg>
<seg id="8">A deal would combine the world's two largest brewers, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.</seg>
<seg id="9">Burberry shares were 0.9% higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.</seg>
<seg id="10">Richemont's latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - had begun to grow again.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5bn through a share placement as part of its debt-cutting strategy.</seg>

<seg id="2">Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from an Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grocery wholesaler Metcash has kicked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering taste testing at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the food, liquor and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual investor strategy day.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="8">South Australian and Western Australian shoppers are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snare around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Metcash's high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million in earnings before interest and tax, Mr Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, even though a recent Roy Morgan survey found IGA shoppers were most loyal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "highly, probably disappear within a decade.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Metcash's food and grocery business, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operating deleverage as sales and margins come under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million a year matching shelf prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers refurbish stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and rolling out a better range of private label groceries.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says the price matching and store refurbishment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholesaler will return to underlying profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves kudos rather than criticism for his own behaviour, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the "Special Ks," was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyrgios sledge of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the chair umpire, with Harrison declaring: "Wawrinka should've decked Kyrgios, and I should deck that kid."</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was last seen smashing a racquet after cramp foiled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis has been defended staunchly by Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second singles berth behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing I do feel quite keenly about is I think Thanasi's been dragged into the fray a little bit," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He did break a racquet when he lost when he cramped in the US, but he's not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of that.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he's handled himself extremely well, in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.</seg>
<seg id="11">He's a great team around him, he's got a great family around him and I just think he's been a little hard done by.</seg>
<seg id="12">He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in with the team and so on, he hasn't ever had an issue with the other players, he's well respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he's in great shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for the important tie, starting on Friday, describing the "mutual decision" as the right thing for all, but backing the Canberran to return as a long-term fixture in the team.</seg>
<seg id="14">"First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think Nick, he's risen very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he's growing up in the public eye and he's made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the limelight where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it's best for the team and it's best for him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Europe migrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency, seals border, detains migrants</seg>
<seg id="2">Declaring a state of emergency, Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally, aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.</seg>
<seg id="4">Stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries' checkpoints, those fleeing violence in their homelands pitched tents and settled in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But frustrations were on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a police helicopter hovered above, migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some refused food and water in protest.</seg>
<seg id="8">Serbia's foreign minister declared it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.</seg>
<seg id="9">(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.</seg>
<seg id="10">There will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120,000 more refugees, including some from Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hungary, however, was not pinning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a razor-wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were enlisted in the race to finish the razor wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for migrants, many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations, including Germany.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) razor-wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of crisis," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We are very clear on this: Illegal border crossing is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the military, expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gyorgy Bakondi, homeland security adviser to Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">They got across by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deploying a train car covered with razor wire to close one of them.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chaos enveloped the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside.</seg>
<seg id="29">About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national poll</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second, with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the primary contests, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since last month's CBS News Poll, Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now even.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Clinton still has a large lead with older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point edge with this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support her.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her.</seg>
<seg id="17">Views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton, fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the nominee, the top answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by it's time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).</seg>
<seg id="21">Agreement on the issues, and electability are also cited.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the vice president weighs a potential run for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don't think he should.</seg>
<seg id="23">When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the top pick.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders widens, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is a distant second on this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the most electable has risen.</seg>
<seg id="28">Still, when asked which is more important in a nominee, Democratic voters pick issues over electability.</seg>
<seg id="29">Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, perform well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden does the best of the three on honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him on this.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as in line with their views ideologically.</seg>
<seg id="35">On all of these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">As questions continue about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn't impacted their overall views of her.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it's a different story among the American public overall.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while just about a third are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">The public's views on this were split back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is mainly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think of her as honest and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush do the best on honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">More see Sanders as honest than not, but like Carson, many don't have an opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ben Carson draws close behind Donald Trump in national poll</seg>
<seg id="2">Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump in the newest CBS News/New York Times poll</seg>
<seg id="3">The two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll, leaving others scrounging for a foothold</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican voters nationwide continue to back Trump in large numbers, climbing from 23% support in the last CBS poll, conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in the poll out Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Carson rocketed in that same period from 6% to 23%.</seg>
<seg id="6">The survey also found Carson doing well across demographic groups, edging out Trump among college-educated Republican voters.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, has slipped behind with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling farthest from 10% support last month to 2% now.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio all tied for third place with 6%.</seg>
<seg id="9">The margin of error for the 376-person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus-or-minus 6%, and was conducted Sept.</seg>
<seg id="10">The latest CNN/ORC survey, released last week, showed Carson rising in the polls -- landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump's 32% support.</seg>
<seg id="11">The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.</seg>
<seg id="12">Facing a rising Carson last week, Trump took some potshots at the retired neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman</seg>
<seg id="2">Nearly two years after a college student died during a fraternity hazing ritual in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, murder charges have been filed against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of New York City's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation rite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said he was blindfolded, saddled with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president to seek advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, members began to hide paraphernalia and basically put the fraternity's well-being over that of Michael Deng's," Chief Wagner said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He could not be revived and he died the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to an autopsy report, Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head, torso, and thighs.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternity hazing, with at least one student dying every year from hazing since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng's family, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is an important one.</seg>
<seg id="13">A Monroe County grand jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We want to hold not only the individuals involved, but if there's an organization that sanctioned it, whether officially or unofficially, we're going to hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity revoked its affiliation with the local chapter.</seg>

<seg id="1">Here's what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">A rate hike will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">This we know.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we don't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the economy specifically, history offers little guide about timing.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are, indeed, multiple variables at play.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, however, market participants may find that all the rate-hike fuss may have been overdone.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of 'cheap money,' " Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">That's not to say there won't be effects, however.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's a look at how some areas of the economy could react, based on historical trends:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen over the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">Once the hike hits, though, the impact is not as dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-24 months after the first hike, which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">More specifically, the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent) then back to normal once 500 days have passed, with average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, posted on Barron's.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate-hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help them along.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could hasten a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Most notably, gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, few expect that to last, with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hiking rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants have been bracing for a Fed hike all year, with all eyes turned toward this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at this meeting, futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study since 1950, all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP eclipsing prerecession peaks very quickly post the recovery commencing," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="29">By contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and this is 74 months and counting.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience.</seg>
<seg id="32">The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy.</seg>
<seg id="33">For bonds, it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike/cut in the cycle arrives.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Charles Schwab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between longer- and shorter-dated bonds to move closer together, flattening the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about stretching for yield," Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interestingly, Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Broadly speaking, companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinationals with lots of debt will fare worse, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to outperform during the three months following an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.</seg>
<seg id="43">Firms with strong balance sheets outpaced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994, 1999, and 2004 rate hikes, by an average of 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also outperformed their lower quality counterparts, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt will become a big issue.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside pure stock plays, consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see gains as well through higher yields at the, though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says MP Andrew Bingham</seg>
<seg id="2">Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised station for 'dumbing down'</seg>
<seg id="3">Argues it's becoming increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rival</seg>
<seg id="4">Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they just rip off the Brits</seg>
<seg id="5">Colleague Damien Collins MP attacked The Voice, saying that too wasn't original</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a leading MP has claimed, piling fresh pressure on the broadcaster to prove that it does something that commercial broadcasters do not.</seg>
<seg id="7">Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be "dumbing down" and is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "dumbing down" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Brits by another name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So, if you're trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you're actually just mimicking what is already on the market," Mr Bingham said.</seg>
<seg id="12">BBC director general denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public.</seg>
<seg id="13">What I learn from Radio 3, I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it's commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none.</seg>
<seg id="15">"And also, Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past, because Britons are less educated about classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's output which came under fire for treading on the toes of commercial rivals, during the Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a particularly BBC way."</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from our own in-house stable" next time it launches an entertainment series.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future, or spending licence fee payers' money on other entertainment formats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Internet sales increased at slowest ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame</seg>
<seg id="2">First three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales</seg>
<seg id="3">Last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000</seg>
<seg id="4">Online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe November's Black Friday could be holding back spending</seg>
<seg id="6">For over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain's high streets into ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="7">But experts say there are now signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with just a five per cent rise on last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts say there are signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015</seg>
<seg id="10">'If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000, it was always going to rationalise over time,' Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="11">He explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.</seg>
<seg id="12">It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts, such as on the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="13">But now that is plateauing a bit, you might see (growth) fall away.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Black Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales.</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November .</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to snap up deals crashing a number of retailers websites.</seg>
<seg id="17">Experts believe Black Friday, which saw shoppers fight over bargains, could be holding shoppers off from making purchases</seg>
<seg id="18">Research published by the British Retail Consortium found just over £1 in every £5 was being spent online.</seg>
<seg id="19">For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online, rather than using high street fashion chains.</seg>

<seg id="2">Bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first funerals take place in Mecca</seg>
<seg id="3">Come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group</seg>
<seg id="4">The Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed down</seg>
<seg id="5">Carried aloft through the streets, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand mosque.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dressed largely in white, mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="7">The sad possession passed by the holy site, where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto worshipers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.</seg>
<seg id="9">The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="12">Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj to Mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to descend on the city.</seg>
<seg id="13">Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it was not in use.</seg>
<seg id="14">An Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.</seg>
<seg id="15">The news agency's English service did not report that detail, but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to topple into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have converged ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month.</seg>
<seg id="17">Binladin Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment.</seg>
<seg id="18">The royal decree also blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteorological officials.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque, part of the massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and runs major building projects.</seg>
<seg id="21">Al Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son disowned by the family in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="22">The crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every able-bodied Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="23">Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="24">Officials ordered one million riyals (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed, and the same amount to those permanently injured.</seg>
<seg id="25">Others injured will receive half that amount.</seg>

<seg id="1">B&Q boss says Eastern European tradesmen working cheap is behind trend</seg>
<seg id="2">Britons are increasingly employing handymen says Veronique Laury</seg>
<seg id="3">Number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe behind rise</seg>
<seg id="4">Resulting in 200 more Screwfix stores, aimed at tradesmen, opening</seg>
<seg id="5">At same time Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets across the country</seg>
<seg id="6">By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail</seg>
<seg id="7">Britons are said to be putting down their hammers and paintbrushes in favour of employing skilled Eastern European tradesmen to carry out work in their home</seg>
<seg id="8">If you are handy with a hammer or a whizz at painting walls, it seems you are in the minority these days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because Britons are increasingly employing handymen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.</seg>
<seg id="10">Veronique Laury, new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement chain, said a big rise in the number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices is behind the trend.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result, Kingfisher is planning to open 200 more Screwfix stores, which are aimed at tradesmen, while closing 60 B&Q outlets.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mrs Laury said she wants more women to be employed in B&Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex.</seg>
<seg id="13">Currently the majority of staff are men.</seg>
<seg id="14">She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mrs Laury said: "We still have a majority of men working in our stores.</seg>
<seg id="16">We need to move more towards a balance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women.</seg>
<seg id="18">Women play a big part in the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain's FTSE100 index of leading firms, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kingfisher is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women, including its chief executive and finance director.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.</seg>
<seg id="22">It has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kingfisher posted a fall in both half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of shutting stores.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a result of the trend Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores</seg>

<seg id="2">The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday, to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it, now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-0.25 percent range.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US economy has been performing relatively well, the recovery adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation.</seg>
<seg id="7">However the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move.</seg>
<seg id="9">The decision is due to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Open up!" chant hundreds of refugees at the Horgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border to immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="4">Asylum seekers are already beginning to test out other possible routes into the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">One of them is bypassing the closed border with Serbia through Romania.</seg>
<seg id="6">Another is through Croatia and Slovenia into Austria.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to some reports, the buses that transported refugees from Serbia into Hungary are now being sent to the town of Šid on the Croatian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">The drivers have received orders from the authorities to carry on without stopping.</seg>
<seg id="9">Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs Nebojša Stefanović pledged that his country was doing everything in its power to help the refugees, but that it had limited resources:</seg>
<seg id="10">Our job entails protecting Serbia to the greatest extent possible.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, we should also help these people, make sure that they are treated humanely.</seg>
<seg id="12">But this has already become a Europe-wide problem.</seg>
<seg id="13">It will not be easy to solve; no country in Europe can deal with it on its own, especially such a small country as Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Belgrade is asking Budapest to open its border to the refugees who don't want to stay in Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="15">But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is uncompromising:</seg>
<seg id="16">If someone is claiming to be a refugee, they ought to fill-out the necessary documents for this in Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="17">And if they don't do this, then they will not be permitted to enter our country, because it is completely safe in Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometre fence along the border with Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="19">But Orban is not content to stop there: he plans on erecting a similar fence on the border with Romania.</seg>

<seg id="1">Evangelos Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us".</seg>
<seg id="2">For a number of years, Evangelos Meimarakis was part of the centre-right government, which, according to those on the left, led the country into a financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, having become the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he is mounting a challenge to Tsipras.</seg>
<seg id="4">A few days before the election, he met with a journalist from Euronews.</seg>
<seg id="5">Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!</seg>
<seg id="6">Evangelos Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing to the SYRIZA coalition, but now, judging from the polls, New Democracy has matched it in terms of popularity.</seg>
<seg id="8">What has changed since that time?</seg>
<seg id="9">Evangelos Meimarakis: Greece has changed and we have too.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January of last year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, the country once again has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="13">Investors have fled because Mr. Tsipras chased them away.</seg>
<seg id="14">Over the past nine months, Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the state the country was in in January and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.</seg>
<seg id="15">Now, they can easily compare these promises to what has actually transpired.</seg>
<seg id="16">Daily life has become noticeably worse compared to in January, when the situation was getting better; moreover, this concerned the majority of Greek citizens.</seg>
<seg id="17">Euronews: But you say that if you win the election you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.</seg>
<seg id="18">Evangelos Meimarakis: The fact is that Greece, as we have come to understand in recent years, cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is no coincidence that in all the other countries where rescue programmes were in effect or continue to operate, political forces and all the ruling parties got together in order to implement the programme that they had reached a consensus on, while, at the same time, never abandoning their political or ideological independence.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutes will enable the country to move forward.</seg>
<seg id="21">Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.</seg>
<seg id="22">If, on Monday, you become the new Prime Minister, will you comply with this agreement, or will you change it, at least in part?</seg>
<seg id="23">Evangelos Meimarakis: Actually, we voted for Greece to move along the European path, because we understand all too well the devastating consequences that would have followed the country's withdrawal from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="24">Right now, Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products; we have cohesion funds, and a Juncker package, and assistance in the banking sector.</seg>
<seg id="25">All of this would have been lost if there was no agreement with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the current austerity measures are the result of how Mr. Tsipras conducted negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="27">I know that Europe doesn't want to destroy us.</seg>
<seg id="28">Europe wants to help us.</seg>
<seg id="29">Therefore, if Europe sees that the new Greek government, over the course of their first year in power, wants to restore order, acts rationally, and makes it understood that the country has the strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am confident that all of the assumed commitments, which cannot be implemented due to the fact that they are leading to a recession, could once again become a subject of negotiations, but only after a certain amount of time has passed.</seg>
<seg id="30">It would be a mistake to assume that we could already go back to the negotiating table with our creditors in the first year of the new agreement, since they expect a full implementation of the deal.</seg>
<seg id="31">If we want to regain their trust, we need to continue with privatisation, reforms, and the structural changes that were agreed on, while continuing to benefit from EU funding and greater investment opportunities, which we need to go ahead with to ensure better understanding and cooperation with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="32">Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government didn't present any compelling arguments about many key political issues, which we found out about while discussing these issues with our European colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="33">I can give you an example associated with farmers' incomes.</seg>
<seg id="34">We explained to our European partners that we weren't talking about a fixed monthly income, and, as such, it couldn't be fully taxed in advance.</seg>
<seg id="35">We were told that Tsipras' ministers never spoke about this.</seg>
<seg id="36">That is to say, the Greek ministers were not prepared and were poorly informed, and, as a result, they conducted negotiations ineffectively and concluded a bad agreement.</seg>
<seg id="37">Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table as Mr. Juncker, Mr. Hollande, Ms. Merkel, and other European leaders.</seg>
<seg id="38">Will what you say to them differ in any way from what your predecessor, Anthony Samaras, said to them?</seg>
<seg id="39">Evangelos Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that, up until the end of 2014, we tried our best to fulfil the 2012 agreement, while avoiding the most contentious issues contained within it.</seg>
<seg id="40">We pushed forward with reforms.</seg>
<seg id="41">Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we were operating under extraordinary circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="42">The market crashed, and there were no prospective buyers in sight ready to pay the price the Greek government considered acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="43">Back then, I was the parliamentary speaker and I succeeded in balancing the views of the three parliamentary groups, which, at that time, constituted a parliamentary majority.</seg>
<seg id="44">In spite of their significant ideological disagreements on key bills, we had a working parliament, and this was in the midst of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations happening outside.</seg>
<seg id="45">And we managed to guide the country to a state of normalcy, which would have continued to get better if the process had not been interrupted by early general elections that were the consequence of the December presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="46">Euronews: Over the past weeks, a massive flow of refugees has been moving across Greek territory.</seg>
<seg id="47">What do you think about this situation, and about the reaction of the European countries into which these people are seeking to enter?</seg>
<seg id="48">Evangelos Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb that we will be forced to deal with after our election victory.</seg>
<seg id="49">The reason for this is that the SYRIZA government didn't deal with this situation in the way that it should have.</seg>
<seg id="50">In such matters, it pays to be proactive, because if the problem catches up with you, then you are only left with emergency measures.</seg>
<seg id="51">And we now find ourselves in this situation.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA has done more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.</seg>
<seg id="53">I am confident that the actions of the interim government, which has been provided with valuable assistance from the President of the Republic, who has called for an EU summit to be held, will enable us to find a solution.</seg>
<seg id="54">We need to see how many refugees could leave the country, and take note: refugees, not illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are victims of the war in Syria: victims of certain extreme events that have happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="56">This issue has a deeply humanitarian aspect to it, and we will support the position that European politicians should take in this new situation.</seg>
<seg id="57">An appropriate decision should be made at the EU summit and it should also involve the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="58">We need to have better coordinated actions, more effective border controls, and refugee processing centres.</seg>
<seg id="59">We also need to effectively use the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be in a position to deal with this urgent problem.</seg>
<seg id="60">Euronews: Mister Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.</seg>
<seg id="61">Evangelos Meimarakis: Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="2">After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he "could take it back," authorities revealed Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police in Gautier, Miss. said Lamb, a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="4">Monday and said he had shot and killed someone.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send officers over to his home.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that is "not going to bother anyone" but is likely upset.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting.</seg>
<seg id="9">When police got to the scene they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, that said: "I am so sorry I wish I could take it back.</seg>
<seg id="10">I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me.</seg>
<seg id="11">After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cops closed in.</seg>
<seg id="12">University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "love triangle."</seg>
<seg id="14">Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends."</seg>
<seg id="18">Prentiss worked an online job from her home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified as a close friend of Prentiss by the Sun Herald.</seg>
<seg id="19">Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hound dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.</seg>
<seg id="20">"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Police said Lamb had phoned relatives at some point Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."</seg>
<seg id="22">When cops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over, bailed out on foot, ran into the woods and shot and killed himself.</seg>
<seg id="23">Lamb received a doctorate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to his resume posted on the university's website.</seg>

<seg id="1">Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for months with double fracture</seg>
<seg id="2">Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.</seg>
<seg id="3">While this left the full-back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains hopeful Shaw could play again this season.</seg>
<seg id="4">The injury was caused by a reckless tackle from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had burst into the PSV area.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required oxygen before being taken to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."</seg>
<seg id="7">He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is awful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very difficult and then plays fantastically and then this happens.</seg>
<seg id="9">When it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was crying.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am not a doctor but when you have a double fracture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase.</seg>
<seg id="12">I hope he can play again this season.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot-kick.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not penalise the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="15">Van Gaal suggested the Italian official had erred.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a very bad tackle with two legs.</seg>
<seg id="18">A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you everyone for your messages, words can't describe how gutted I am, my road to recovery starts now, I will come back stronger."</seg>
<seg id="19">Related: Manchester United suffer Luke Shaw blow in defeat at PSV</seg>
<seg id="20">The England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June.</seg>

<seg id="22">If any player goes off with this kind of injury, everybody is very sad about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="25">"He finds it very difficult because the intention was not to injure the opponent, and when you hear it is a very bad injury, it's not good," Cocu said.</seg>
<seg id="26">For me it was not possible to see the moment.</seg>
<seg id="27">The only thing I could see was the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the tackle on Luke.</seg>
<seg id="28">Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.</seg>
<seg id="29">I feel very bad about it, I am so sorry.</seg>

<seg id="1">Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better than this?</seg>
<seg id="2">It's one thing any parent soon learns: when your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unless, it seems, you are David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">Asked by a provider of holiday childcare schemes to name his favourite kids' book, the prime minister opted for The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr Seuss.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the SuperCamps company, continuing: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed."</seg>
<seg id="6">All very well, except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a précis of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Set in the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," it reads, chronicling a love interest unknown to Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="8">If that wasn't suspicious enough, Cameron's submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lorax film provided on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey."</seg>
<seg id="9">Given he is an avowedly hands-on parent, it seems unlikely Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book's plot, in which a young unnamed boy hears how the local environment was devastated by the avaricious, tree-chopping, thneed-knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squat, moustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, such a relatively lowly PR task would have been outsourced to an aide, seemingly one who has never read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron's constituency office.</seg>
<seg id="12">SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron's staff, but had no further immediate comment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of England omission but it's still tough</seg>
<seg id="2">Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">I wouldn't rule out an away win, either.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that batting lineup and the collective mindset is strong; they will not carry scars from 2012, only a youthful positivity.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, represents an attacking option.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to omit Adam Lyth is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="8">His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on output.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors.</seg>
<seg id="10">A couple of half-centuries and Lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hopefully if he punches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me; he is a team man above all else.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth got seven caps - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the chance home and away.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only gripe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean first - when Lyth was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is an X-factor cricketer, which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit.</seg>
<seg id="19">He must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make-up of the side in the UAE.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea of Moeen opening the batting alongside Cook, which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four quicks, has been floated and it is not something I am against.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't see why a strokemaker cannot bat there and this left-hander has already shown he is one hell of a cricketer.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen may not have done the job for his county, Worcestershire, but he has been a No3 for them and there is not much difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">He peeled off three centuries immediately and did not look back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner and, in my limited dealings with him, he has struck me as very impressive young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People may look at his raw stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt but there are not a heap of spinners putting their hands up and selectors have opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn a lot on this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Away from the squad, England look to have made a couple of shrewd additions to their coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterstroke.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the game's loveliest blokes, who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it playing or coaching, and like Mahela has nous that can be tapped.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before, can freshen up a side.</seg>
<seg id="34">Colly's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes is rested for the one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this.</seg>
<seg id="35">While not everyone will agree, the coaches and selectors do not set the schedule.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you have to remember, like players, their jobs are dependent on results.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are never taken lightly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brexit camp might win the day if economy is in doldrums by 2017</seg>
<seg id="2">David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes, even without the election of genial Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the Labour leadership, or the TUC cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages too.</seg>
<seg id="4">A European diplomat chum explained the other day that, sunk in assorted crises as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain's self-absorbed agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes which they mostly don't want.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Brighton for its annual bean, the TUC decided it didn't want them either if they eroded social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.</seg>
<seg id="7">PM and chancellor rock up to summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local grandee, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's all about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European pal, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.</seg>
<seg id="10">Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously level-headed chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her, as it did for overstayers Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).</seg>
<seg id="11">France's François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is a fading force too.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right, Spain one of the left.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Selfie Brits, whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks, SNP-style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the Brexit process, my pal suggests.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The renegotiation was a fix" and "Britain got nothing of value out of the renegotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Europeans know to their cost how predatory Fleet Street can be and how EU-sceptic the oligarch press barons are, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2:1.</seg>
<seg id="18">They may dimly remember Boris Johnson, the arch Euro-opportunist, making his name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.</seg>
<seg id="19">For all his foolishness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.</seg>
<seg id="20">They included the medley of tax-shy rascals, phone-hacking foreigners and pseudo non-doms who own most of our great newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them, but realised that when you're in a cage with a randy gorilla you have to pass the bananas to distract it from having you for lunch and again for tea.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposing Cameron's referendum wheeze, since Blair had conceded the principle over the EU's aborted constitution, sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get-out card.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press never forgave him that either.</seg>
<seg id="24">But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose BBC sofa he vacated on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says he'd like us to stay in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well, most people outside Ukip's woad-wearing tendency and the wilder shores of Tory little Englanderism can probably say yes to that.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 70s, when his old dad struggled on TV to be disloyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilary's struggle was more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But fighting to stay in "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever the bottom-up, touchy-feely image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and especially in the maelstrom that is social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It's fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles.</seg>

<seg id="2">Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers have said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE published the "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">But several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy foundation" on which PHE based its main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Writing in the BMJ, two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research paper.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also endorsed BAT's public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.</seg>
<seg id="14">The rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided, but they include several known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research paper produced by the group "tellingly concedes" there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been responded to before.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small by comparison, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2bn a year.</seg>
<seg id="26">By spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national remit.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 chief</seg>
<seg id="2">The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying its commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcasters.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals" biggest rating shows, and on channels such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie-up with the BBC without success.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you keep the licence fee, which I'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea, it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren't making and commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="8">They broadcast The Voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else would show that is a joke, it's ludicrous, it's obviously nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is one, EastEnders is another, admittedly made in-house.</seg>
<seg id="12">Frankly other channels would give their right arm for it.</seg>
<seg id="13">I struggle to see how it's public service broadcasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of people who work there, and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments about the BBC's most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as EastEnders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said the BBC's more niche public service programmes "go on to BBC4 where quite often you can't measure the audience but they fulfil their remit and they can argue when they go on their sanctimonious missions about justifying £4bn in licence fee income, "Well of course, we do all these obscure programmes that no one watched."</seg>
<seg id="18">They put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the best value from it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course you all think, we all think, £150 a year is great value, but for people for whom £150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don't consume a lot of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="22">He said little of the BBC's output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV output and 0.1% on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcasters in Australia and Canada and change it to "inform, enlighten and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said only a handful were shown on TV, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them all available to watch online.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Sonogenetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high-pitched for humans to hear.</seg>
<seg id="5">The pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light</seg>
<seg id="7">Researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure, dubbed sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves which then pass inside the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels, found in the membranes of some of the worms" cells.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to, according to a report in Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.</seg>
<seg id="14">When he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they switched on the modified motor neurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over that technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unlike light, which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that, using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make target human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="4">Horrific killer drones!</seg>
<seg id="5">Ankle-shattering leg irons!</seg>
<seg id="6">Cluster bombs!</seg>
<seg id="7">And electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!</seg>
<seg id="8">The cheery voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world's biggest arms fair is a sharp spoof, produced for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to flog weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International's jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.</seg>
<seg id="9">Related: DSEI weapons fair: authoritarian regimes descend on London</seg>
<seg id="10">But a separate campaign is also leading to many posters cropping up at bus stops and on tube trains that require a second glance.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Important announcement, Travelling on the DLR from 15th to 18th September?" reads one, using London Underground fonts and branding with the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.</seg>
<seg id="12">This September, a swarm of arms dealers will be descending on the DLR ... Customers are requested to help stop the arms fair.</seg>
<seg id="13">The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy's Dismaland.</seg>
<seg id="14">A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 pack of Allen keys which it claims "gain access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet."</seg>
<seg id="15">Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the spoof ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more questioning and seeking to take political work to audiences outside galleries.</seg>
<seg id="18">A lot of artists are moving to work with activists within protest movements, realising they have to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.</seg>
<seg id="19">Another of the anti-arms trade posters greeting commuters on the tube.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Amnesty video has been watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by ad agency VCCP working pro bono, with the graphic designer and voiceover artist also working for free.</seg>
<seg id="21">VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space on ExCeL's calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."</seg>
<seg id="22">They toyed with creating a more realistic dodgy corporate advert, but "by ramming it home with bright colours and animation, it was more arresting."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They've done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="24">What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.</seg>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors flog fantastically euphemistic products.</seg>
<seg id="26">In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US army for "the shoulder-launched AT4CS RS."</seg>
<seg id="27">This includes a "unique shaped-charge warhead that delivers outstanding behind-armour-effects inside the target."</seg>

<seg id="1">Eight golden rules for living in student halls</seg>
<seg id="2">It's been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an oblivious 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moving into halls can range from mildly nerve-racking to totally terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, whether and where you took a gap year, where you stand on Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite because seriously guys it's just yeast extract HAHAHA I'll be in my room."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take a breath.</seg>
<seg id="7">And help others take one too - ask questions and show interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">It steers the conversation and helps you to scout out the people you like versus those you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were dispensing extinguishers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Give people space.</seg>
<seg id="10">People's rooms often morph into drinks receptions, movie-night venues and communal hangout spots, but they're also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear.</seg>
<seg id="11">Related: Don't even think about starting university in a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">Introverts get a raw deal at university.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a retreat, yet many halls form an inter-room-strolling culture that's friendly, social and conducive to lifelong friendships.</seg>
<seg id="14">That can be hell for someone who's trying to recharge.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I've expended on interacting with you."</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socialising - and maybe text instead of knocking.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking of knocking: do it.</seg>
<seg id="18">One guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn't locked he was invited in.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw some things.</seg>
<seg id="20">Make friends through baking.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since you're starting uni at the height of Bake-Off mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies seems marginally less weird, less 1950s "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I baked you something, now smile as I ask you personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="22">Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.</seg>
<seg id="23">Your housemates will feel obliged to chat, and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Obviously this is subject to you being a decent baker.</seg>
<seg id="25">Poorly-fused lumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stealing food is a common crime in student halls.</seg>
<seg id="27">Obviously nicking someones chicken is theft, but is taking a drop of milk for your tea stealing?</seg>
<seg id="28">Double check with the milk owner.</seg>
<seg id="29">Chances are they'll tell you to help yourself even if they're seething inside.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it more maturely than my hallmate, who tainted her milk with washing-up liquid to punish those who stole it.</seg>
<seg id="31">She's in jail now.</seg>
<seg id="32">You shouldn't make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying.</seg>
<seg id="33">This isn't just to be a decent human, but because you are the proverbial people in glass houses.</seg>
<seg id="34">A girl on my corridor asked her neighbour if they wouldn't mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="35">They responded by turning it up.</seg>
<seg id="36">When they finally shut up at 5am, she kindly let them sleep for two hours before blasting her own music, locking her door as she left for her three-hour exam.</seg>
<seg id="37">Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same hall as you?</seg>
<seg id="38">Conversely, wouldn't it be knuckle-bitingly awkward if you mistook a hallmate for your future spouse, hooked up, broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get custody of all your mutual friends?</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot hallmate is definitely not your future spouse, try to at least talk some sense into your groin.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the exhilarating moment you realise someone's left their keys inside their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is finer than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="41">A good prank is funny, but takes moments to reverse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Teach a valuable and amusing lesson about security by hiding something - but never trash someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lock their door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't Blu-Tack their possessions to the ceiling more than twice.</seg>

<seg id="5">US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov in order to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="6">The publication PJ media reports on this.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Secretary Kerry made it clear that continued support of President Assad by Russia creates a risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, and also negatively impacts our common goal - combatting extremism - if we do not remain focused on finding ways to solve the Syrian conflict via a direct transfer of power", stated representatives of the US State Department.</seg>
<seg id="8">They also noted that Kerry, once again, stressed the US's commitment to the fight against Islamic State within the framework of a coalition of more than 60 countries.</seg>

<seg id="1">Imported yachts will be exempt from paying customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other watercraft for leisure or sport from paying customs duties or taxes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The necessary changes to the list of goods eligible for temporary duty-free entry were prepared by the ministry under instructions from the government of the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yelena Lashkina, aide to the Minister of Economic Development, reported this to Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="5">In June 2015, as a result of a trip to Crimea, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instructed a number of government agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Customs Service, and the Federal Tourism Agency - to prepare proposals to create favourable conditions for yachting in the costal regions of the country.</seg>
<seg id="6">In turn, experts point out that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storage, servicing, and maintenance of yachts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Owners prefer to store their vessels abroad: approximately €200 mln every year enters the coffers of European states for the maintenance, repair, and servicing of yachts.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft resolution of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amendments to the List of Goods temporarily imported with full exemption from the payment of customs duties and taxes in relation to imported yachts and other watercraft used for leisure and sport".</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the ministry, this would certainly support the creation of favourable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal regions of the country, Lashkina noted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This matter was submitted for consideration by the sub-commission on customs tariffs, non-tariff regulation, and protective measures in foreign trade of the Governmental Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which held a meeting in September, and, following the discussion, it was also approved by the government agencies.</seg>
<seg id="11">As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure for full conditional exemption at the time of importation is essentially a benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, following approval of the meeting minutes of the sub-commission by the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will present the proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion by member states of the EEU, Lashkina explained.</seg>
<seg id="13">The list of imported goods that are fully exempt from payment of customs duties and taxes includes goods that are necessary for facilitating foreign trade and international cooperation, for use in the fields of science, culture, film, sport, and tourism, for the provision of international aid, and others. These other goods include: office equipment (personal computers, typewriters), monitoring and measuring instruments, drilling equipment, stage costumes and sets, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, race cars, motorcycles, sport aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments, and items for religious ceremonies.</seg>
<seg id="14">The press service for the Ministry of Transportation of the Russian Federation told Izvestia that they had prepared compulsory regulations for the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosiya, and Yevpatoriya, which provide for simplified procedures for registering the entry and departure of small-sized, sport sailboats, and recreational watercraft in the seaport.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Ministry of Transportation has given orders to the captains of seaports in Crimea to ensure the administration of the simplified procedures for the entry of small-sized, sport sailboats, and recreational watercraft into the seaport and for the departure of the above-listed vessels from the seaport.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Ministry of Transportation has also prepared draft decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation regarding confirmation of the water boundaries of the seaports of Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="17">Decrees concerning Yalta and Feodosiya have already been enacted, while the others are still in the approval stage, noted the agency's press service.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is the opinion of the Ministry of Transportation that state control, classification, inspection, and registration of small-sized vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be conducted by the Republic of Crimea and by Sevastopol.</seg>
<seg id="19">The issue is that yachting is very difficult in Russia because of poorly developed infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one looks at the South of Italy or France, there is an entire and ever-growing industry, involving a large number of people.</seg>
<seg id="21">In Russia, however, everything is at a virtual standstill.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our coastline is not very interesting; the only part where it is possible to operate yachts year-round is in the Black Sea near Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, and Anapa.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the big difficulty in this area is that the rules of the border service are very strict: in order to cruise in a yacht, it is necessary to register for a lot of permits.</seg>
<seg id="24">Besides, within Russia, there isn't even anywhere to refuel.</seg>
<seg id="25">A yacht could cruise on its fuel reserves for two days and then it will be faced with the problem of where to find more, said, Denis Novikov, Director of Sales for the company Nordmarine.</seg>
<seg id="26">In terms of places to store yachts, there are now special docks in Moscow and Saint Petersburg that can accommodate yachts up to 30m. Yachts are also sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden, and Germany to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="27">Novikov noted that buyers of yachts are wealthy people, but that, since the beginning of the economic crisis, demand for yachts has declined.</seg>

<seg id="1">Prisons are asked to create separate blocs for transgender people.</seg>
<seg id="2">In October 2015, at the Public Council of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of rights of convicted offenders, the possibility of creating separate blocs in penal colonies for transgender people and transvestites will be discussed among other issues.</seg>
<seg id="3">A member of the council, Vladislav Grib, spoke to Izvestia about this.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to him, depending on the number of prisoners in Russia who are questioning their gender identity, it may be possible to provide separate cells or blocs in domestic prisons, or even (if there are a lot of such criminals) the establishment of a special penal colony for transsexuals in the future.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, Vladislav Grib stresses that assigning a citizen to serve out a sentence in such isolated areas would only be possible after the convicted person had gone through the necessary medical examination that proves that the criminal is actually a person who identifies themselves as a member of the opposite sex.</seg>
<seg id="6">Vladislav Grib is sure that separating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving out their sentences.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to him, the proposed method is being successfully applied abroad: in a pre-trial detention facility (where the accused stay until the court's ruling), separate cells are made available for transgender people, and in correctional facilities there are special blocs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, this is the only way of dealing with these types of criminals.</seg>
<seg id="9">Obviously, they need to be separated, as the presence of transvestites and transgender people in regular cells is dangerous for them: it causes suffering for their families and a sea of troubles for FSIN staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">The humiliation of trans people by their cellmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's necessary to figure out where to place them, depending on how large of a city it is, and how many criminals there are that are questioning their gender identity.</seg>
<seg id="12">Separate pre-trial detention facilities aren't necessary, just separate cells, and blocs in prisons.</seg>
<seg id="13">Yes, a separate penal colony is a possibility if there turn out to be many transgendered people.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Grib explains, a bloc could hold 50 or 100 people, and if one specialised building is established in Russia, then convicted transsexuals from any region could be sent there to serve out their sentences.</seg>
<seg id="15">Citizens are held in pre-trial detention facilities according to the place where the crime was committed, and, as such, the arrival of transvestites or transgender people from different territorial subjects during the investigation and court proceedings is unrealistic; however, introducing this practice in a separate colony, for those who have already been convicted is definitely possible, Grib believes.</seg>
<seg id="16">To recap, yesterday, law enforcement officers could not decide which pre-trial detention facility - male or female - to assign to 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), detained for drug possession, and, as a result, the man with a girlish appearance was not arrested.</seg>
<seg id="17">He was sent home on the written condition that he would not leave town.</seg>
<seg id="18">This news was widely discussed on social networks and in the media, since, as of yet, there is no procedure in Russia for holding transgender people in pre-trial detention facilities and penal colonies.</seg>
<seg id="19">Russian human rights advocate and activist in the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender), Nikolai Alekseev, supports the idea of creating special places for transgender people to serve out their sentences, noting that, abroad, it is also possible to place people in penal colonies - male or female - depending on their own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="20">Given the climate in Russian prisons, this is the correct recommendation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yes, it's a very small percentage, but the problem is real, just as is the issue of ensuring the safety of homosexuals in prisons, says Alekseev.</seg>
<seg id="22">Prisons should be safe; therefore, separate blocs could be established for this sake, as well as for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, Alekseev doubts that there will be a lot of citizens in Russia who will be ready to pass themselves off as transsexuals just to get into somewhere other than a regular penal colony.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, a medical examination could be introduced before placing people into a penal colony for transgender people; however, things are not always so straightforward.</seg>
<seg id="25">For example, in the US, one prisoner, Chelsea Manning, looked like a man, but once already in prison, announced that he wanted to change his sex, says Alekseev.</seg>
<seg id="26">A person can feel like they are anyone at all.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, as of yet, there are no separate facilities for transgender people to serve out their sentences, and I doubt that prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people or fathom the complexities of their orientation or gender identification.</seg>
<seg id="28">At the same time, international expert on issues of reproductive health in the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for assigning transsexual criminals to a penal colony could significantly delay the start of the convicts serving their sentences.</seg>
<seg id="29">A committee is created: this is a question of sexology, with psychiatrists conducting long-term examinations - this is not just one test - on the basis of which a highly precise diagnosis is made.</seg>
<seg id="30">Modern practices in psychiatry make this possible.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why, before a sex change, potential patients undergo such expert evaluation; they will definitively show whether or not a sex change requiring surgery is a necessary measure, says Lordkipanidze.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to introduce this system in relation to convicted individuals; after all, on average, it takes an entire month to conduct such an examination.</seg>
<seg id="33">The doctor, in spite of the fact that he supports the general idea of creating separate blocs for transsexuals, also doubts that it would be appropriate under current economic conditions to allocate funds towards the construction of new facilities and medical examinations: transgender people in Russia are few and far between.</seg>
<seg id="34">It's difficult to come up with a number as there are no official statistics, but if one considers that homosexuals account for around 5%, then it is fair to say that there are even fewer transgender people, and that those that have such an inclination and also commit crimes comprise an entirely small number, said Lordkipanidze.</seg>
<seg id="35">Currently, upon submitting a request to the administration of a penal colony, homosexuals and transgender people are already able to obtain separate conditions of confinement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mikhail Antipov wins the Junior World Chess Championship.</seg>
<seg id="2">The world chess championship for youth under 20 has finished in Khanty-Mansiysk.</seg>
<seg id="3">The end of the championship turned out to be more than a little intriguing.</seg>
<seg id="4">The winner was only decided in the final round, and it was Russian Mikhail Antipov who managed to finally overtake the Pole, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who looked set to claim the title.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the girls, victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chess player, Natalia Buksa.</seg>
<seg id="6">By the middle of the world chess championship, which was held a the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, it looked as if there were almost no surprises left, since the Polish representative, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who, having delivered a series of four wins (the tournament is held according to the Swiss system of 13 rounds), confidently took the lead.</seg>
<seg id="7">Given that Duda was rated as a favourite to win the championship, and generally is considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would throw away his lead seemed rather insignificant.</seg>
<seg id="8">Even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to narrow the gap to just half a point, he still remained the favourite in the fight for the title.</seg>
<seg id="9">After all, Antipov absolutely had to win in the 13th round in order to surpass the leader.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even that wouldn't help if Duda won his match.</seg>
<seg id="11">Moreover, this obligation to win could of course have an impact on the Russian chess player's game and lead to unnecessary mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.</seg>
<seg id="13">He confidently dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for Duda, who was facing Benjamin Bok, to finish his match.</seg>
<seg id="14">Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player ended the stand-off against the Dutchman in a draw.</seg>
<seg id="15">In this way, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of a possible 13 - but Antipov had better additional criteria.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is for this reason that the administration of Khanty-Mansi autonomous area, whose governor is Natalia Komarova, which traditionally pays a lot of attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded the grand prize to him.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, there were no surprises at the end of the girls' competitions.</seg>
<seg id="18">The tournament leader, Natalia Buksa (Ukraine), only needed to not lose in the final match to win the title, which she successfully did.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol didn't enable her to surpass Buksa.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Russian athlete placed second, just half a point behind the champion.</seg>

<seg id="13">We are saying that this isn't right; it's too much: cut your costs, learn to economise, give up the extravagant private residences, football teams, and private TV stations, and stop spending money right, left, and centre.</seg>

<seg id="1">This year, the Association of Russian Managers' study, "Top 1000 Russian Managers", will be published for the 16th time.</seg>
<seg id="2">As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of top Russian managers, the study takes stock of the work of Russian executives for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.</seg>
<seg id="3">The initial pool of candidates consists of winners from last year's rating.</seg>
<seg id="4">Winners from the previous year are asked to confirm their participation as a candidate in the current year's rating and to nominate members from their own management team.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moreover, each of those included in the initial list of candidates are invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies whom it would be advisable to add the general pool of candidates.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is possible to nominate the following heads of functional areas of a company: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, human resources director, IT director, director of public and corporate relations, director of government relations, and director of corporate governance.</seg>
<seg id="7">Each of the managers proposed by the experts is sent an invitation to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate their management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The nomination of candidates by sector is based on the Association of Managers' industry classification: information technology, commercial banking, the forestry and wood processing industry, manufacturing, the media industry, the metal industry, multi-industry holdings, professional services, the communications and data industry, service and consumer goods production, insurance, construction, trade, transportation, the financial sector, pharmaceuticals, the chemical industry, and the energy and fuel complex.</seg>
<seg id="9">Each participant is given a username and password to log into the site, www.top1000.amr.ru, where they can find information about the other participants and submit their assessments according to the proposed criteria for each functional area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The methodology for the rating is based on the principle of "the best choosing the best": top managers rating top managers, and functional managers rating functional managers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Such a principle makes it possible to obtain the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="12">The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of the expert commission.</seg>
<seg id="13">All interested candidates of the current year's rating and repeat candidates from previous years' ratings are invited to attend the in-person meetings of the expert commission.</seg>
<seg id="14">The commission is organised along functional lines: a commission for approving top managers and eight commissions for approving heads of functional departments.</seg>
<seg id="15">At meetings of the expert commissions, the presented lists are to be approved in alphabetical order (rankings are kept in strict accordance with the internet assessment and remain confidential until the publication of the rating), or updated changes are made to them in accordance with the enclosed list of reserve candidates.</seg>
<seg id="16">Company names are presented in accordance with Russian language rules and Kommersant standards.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the time of publication, changes to the status of managers and companies are possible.</seg>

<seg id="1">10-13% is a comfortable rate for investment loans.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to experts, the credit market for small and medium businesses shrunk by 40% between January and April of this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">In your opinion, what is the situation like today?</seg>
<seg id="4">After the panicked mood at the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs declined significantly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The reason is obvious: a sharp rise in interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="6">Financing at 25-30% per annum wasn't beneficial to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="7">If previously, a bank could place all of its potential future problems, from arrears to defaults, at a higher rate, then now it is no longer possible to do this: the rates are already sky-high.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the business community, the current level of interest rates for loans to SMEs isn't comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="9">For a significant proportion of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their rate of return.</seg>
<seg id="10">An interest rate level of between 10-13% would enable businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and make an attractive profit from them.</seg>
<seg id="11">In your opinion, to what extent is the demand for credit by business owners being met?</seg>
<seg id="12">The situation improved slightly after the Central Bank lowered the interest rate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Credit resources became more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, according to our observations, clients have started to apply for loans much more infrequently.</seg>
<seg id="15">First of all, businesses can't discern the prospects for their development or future earnings.</seg>
<seg id="16">Today, businesses have one option: they need to learn how to operate by focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's necessary to more closely monitor current performance and control cash flow.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the same time, when financial resources are available, it makes sense to use new technologies that allow for the modernisation of equipment and the reduction of production and energy costs.</seg>
<seg id="19">All this, ultimately, enables companies to make their production more competitive and maintain their business even in an unstable economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="20">Which main trends in the SME lending market will become more pronounced and will influence its development up until the end of 2015?</seg>
<seg id="21">Will the interest rate change?</seg>
<seg id="22">The forecast regarding a reduction of the average rate will depend a lot on the policies of the Central Bank; currently, the regulator is demonstrating consistency when it comes to lowering the key rate.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, there's no point in waiting for a drastic decline in the cost of credit for SMEs.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the current situation, the problem, first and foremost, is inflation, which necessitates a higher interest rate to obtain real earnings.</seg>
<seg id="25">Moreover, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even with a lowering of rates by the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="26">If we're talking about the level of arrears, then traditionally, small and medium size businesses, limited by their ability to replenish funds, as well as by possibilities for adjusting economic behaviour, will, of course, present a big risk to lenders.</seg>
<seg id="27">I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.</seg>
<seg id="28">The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.</seg>

<seg id="1">The new Mazda CX-5 and street style.</seg>
<seg id="2">This is how the word Mazda is written in Japanese characters.</seg>
<seg id="3">Beautiful, concise, and, at the same time, quite difficult for those who are used to the Cyrillic or Latin alphabets.</seg>
<seg id="4">Likewise, the new CX-5 crossover, as with any other model by the brand, is attractive without being pretentious on the outside, and technically sound on the inside.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Japanese, simply by virtue of their "Japaneseness", are capable of turning an attachment to products from the country of the rising sun into a state of total admiration.</seg>
<seg id="6">You can make as many arguments as you like for cars from other countries, and the person may even agree with these arguments in principle, but the whole conversation will fall apart with the final phrase: "But it's a Japanese car!</seg>
<seg id="7">There's no point in arguing about it!</seg>
<seg id="8">Such people, undoubtedly, ought to love not only technology, but also everything else Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="9">Quote Bashō off the top of their heads, add wasabi to their food, collect katanas, and dress their girlfriends, not in kimonos of course, but according to the edicts of Japanese street style: cute, creative, and totally unexpected.</seg>
<seg id="10">Take the Japanese school uniform: the only uniform that girls are happy to wear even after graduating from school.</seg>
<seg id="11">It possesses amazing qualities: at the same time both sensual and strict.</seg>
<seg id="12">And the older a girl is, the shorter her skirt.</seg>
<seg id="13">The major change in the look of the CX-5 is the front grill with its five horizontal lines.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the new shape of the headlights and taillights significantly changes the look of the car, which makes the automobile immediately recognisable in the flow of traffic.</seg>
<seg id="15">As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very enticing.</seg>
<seg id="16">The silhouette is harmonious and the shapes are sensual, but, in spite of this, the appearance has a touch of severity.</seg>
<seg id="17">There's no need to call the police.</seg>
<seg id="18">Behind the wheel of the CX-5, which is one of the safest cars in the world, you can experience sheer stoic Japanese tranquillity.</seg>
<seg id="19">The 2.2L diesel engine delivers high torque over a wide range of speeds.</seg>
<seg id="20">Moreover, the fuel consumption of this 175 horsepower engine is only 5.9L, and it comes exclusively equipped with an automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.</seg>
<seg id="21">Black boots, black coat, black bag...</seg>
<seg id="22">To add a little black humour to this image, you can pick out some leggings with a police "Do Not Cross" design on them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Incidentally, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that you don't end up in a car accident when behind the wheel of a CX-5.</seg>
<seg id="24">To even further enhance comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension of the front and rear shock absorbers was redesigned, and the shape of the front lower control arm bushings was also improved.</seg>
<seg id="25">The all-wheel drive system has been adapted to Russian conditions.</seg>
<seg id="26">The road and engine noise levels at high speeds have been reduced by 13%.</seg>
<seg id="27">A swimsuit in flowers or stripes is just as boring as a budget sedan.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's another thing entirely when a girl flaunts about in a swimsuit with an original design.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, from a roller derby video game.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then she'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!</seg>
<seg id="31">The new CX-5 has better designed front and rear seats, which provide optimal extra space for both broad shoulders and long legs - whoever has what.</seg>
<seg id="32">Moreover, those with long legs will certainly appreciate the fact that the rests at the front part of the centre console are now soft and don't hit your ankles in the curves.</seg>
<seg id="33">Mazda's most comprehensive package of active safety systems is offered specifically on the CX-5.</seg>
<seg id="34">Radars, lasers, and cameras are used in order to identify potential threats.</seg>
<seg id="35">It also includes adaptive lighting, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, and safety breaking.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in its class.</seg>
<seg id="37">Convenient and with minimal obstructions, it can accommodate a cargo volume of 561L. The back seats fold down in a 4:2:4 configuration, with each section having its own remote control lever, which increases the trunk space to 1560L.</seg>
<seg id="38">In Japan, a cartoon character's costume is called a "kigurumi".</seg>
<seg id="39">Kigurumi pyjamas look especially cheerful.</seg>
<seg id="40">You can do anything in them!</seg>
<seg id="41">Of course you can sleep.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kiev breaks up the atomic union.</seg>
<seg id="2">Kiev has officially filed a renouncement of Ukraine's cooperation with Russia to complete the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Wednesday, the Verkhovnaya Rada, during a second attempt, ultimately voted for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="4">Agreements to complete the third and fourth blocks were signed back in 2010-2012, but the launch of the project never happened.</seg>
<seg id="5">On Wednesday, the Verkhovnaya Rada of Ukraine adopted a law terminating the agreement concluded with the Russian Federation between 2010-2012 to construct the third and fourth blocks of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.</seg>
<seg id="6">The country's government only succeeded in introducing the bill after the second vote; during the first round it was supported by 210, while a minimum of 226 were needed, but after the revote, 234 members of parliament voted for the draft.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the original plans, the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant, which was initiated during the Soviet period, was to consist of four 1 GW power units with pressurised water reactors, but only two were ever built.</seg>
<seg id="8">Negotiations with Moscow on completing construction led to the signing of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010; while between 2011-2012, the Rada adopted the relevant legislation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since funds from Ukraine's budget weren't available, it was assumed that the block would be constructed using loans provided by the Russian side, but funds were never allocated.</seg>
<seg id="10">After the revolution in Kiev in February 2014 and the resulting cooling of relations between the two countries, Kiev began to phase-out dealings with Moscow in the nuclear sector, announcing the refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant and on a project to construct a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="11">The only area where relations have been preserved is for the purchase of fuel from Russia for already-operating Ukrainian nuclear power plants (which provided approximately half of the country's power production), since Ukraine's National Atomic Energy Generating Company, Enorgatom, has nothing to replace Russian supplies with yet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Plans to complete construction of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant in Ukraine with different contractors haven't been definitively scrapped yet: as early as in 2014, an announcement was made in Kiev about negotiations with the Czech company Skoda JS.</seg>

<seg id="2">During a press conference, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.</seg>
<seg id="3">"There is no military solution", AP quotes him as replying to a question concerning military support of Syria by Russia.</seg>

<seg id="6">"The meeting will be about Syria", he announced.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier today, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, reported that the General Staff has not ruled out the possibility of establishing an air force base in Syria in the future.</seg>
<seg id="8">Right now, there are no such plans.</seg>

<seg id="6">At the same time, according to the politician, there is support in Kiev for any form of dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier, the representative for Ukraine at the negotiations, the country's former President, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Lukhansk essentially have still not changed their positions on tripartite negotiations, but that the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mandates allotted to parties.</seg>
<seg id="2">Yesterday, the Nizhny Novgorod electoral commission summed up the results of the city duma elections according to municipal district, which allocated 12 deputy seats awarded according to party lists.</seg>
<seg id="3">As per usual, many complaints about violations during the elections were heard from representatives of the CPRF, who accused the electoral commission of "concealing fraud".</seg>
<seg id="4">The opposition's objections were not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, the electoral commission denied the Communists of Russia party's attempt to organise a referendum concerning the elimination of fees for capital repairs to apartment blocks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The city electoral commission has officially released the results of the elections to the Nizhny Novgorod City Duma according to municipal electoral district.</seg>
<seg id="7">Altogether, 1.03 mln people were included on the voters list for Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand voting ballots were issued at precinct commissions, and 268 thousand voters cast their ballots in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than 11.7 thousand ballots were determined to be void, while 24 remain unaccounted for.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yesterday, 12 seats were allocated among political parties according to the votes they received.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to United Russia's lists, six deputy seats go to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Party leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, received the only seat for LDPR.</seg>
<seg id="12">Two seats for the CPRF were allocated to Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma Deputy, Aleksandr Tarnaev.</seg>
<seg id="13">Three seats for A Just Russia went to Aleksandr Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov, and Mikhail Shalyugin.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now, these candidates need to determine within five days whether or not they will work as deputies in the city duma: in the event of a refusal of a mandate, the seat will go to the next candidate on the party list.</seg>
<seg id="15">Chairman for the city electoral commission, Aleksandr Makeev, informed members of the commission that he was establishing shifts to "dispatch telegrams to Zhirinovsky and the others" for the purpose of refusing their mandates.</seg>
<seg id="16">Upon approval of the protocol on the results of the election, representatives from the CPRF filed complaints about multiple violations.</seg>
<seg id="17">Leonid Krasnokutsky, an advisory member of the city electoral commission from the CPRF, proposed rejecting the results of the vote in four districts, Nos. 21-24, recalling how, under an order from the head of the administration for Sormovsky district, the entrance to the administration building where the four district commissions were located was closed.</seg>
<seg id="18">State Duma deputies, the candidates themselves, and observers weren't able to get inside for a long time, and the public outcry, which resulted in a storming of the doors to the district administration building, was shown on television.</seg>
<seg id="19">All observers and advisory members of the commission were able to attend the meetings of the district committees.</seg>
<seg id="20">The head of the administration only suspended their access when the voting had ended and the precinct commissions still had not arrived to hand over their ballots.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was done to prevent various provocations.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Then the head of the administration was corrected, and interested parties were permitted to attend all meetings", retorted Natalia Andryushina, member of the city electoral commission.</seg>
<seg id="23">The communists objected that Lyudmila Aristova, a deputy in the regional legislative assembly, was illegally detained in the blockaded administration building for more than four hours, and a complaint regarding this has been sent to the investigative committee.</seg>
<seg id="24">The opposition was also outraged that, on election day, several precinct electoral commissions started to seal ballot boxes at between 6 and 7 o'clock the morning, placing early voting ballots inside of them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Moreover, no one notified the advisory members of the commission and observers, and, as such, they only arrived right at the start of the elections at 8 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="26">The communists are confident that, in the morning before the opening of polling stations, ballots could have been stuffed into the ballot boxes without supervision.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, according to Aleksandr Makeev, the city electoral commission, which has already investigated more than 124 various complaints, didn't find any violations involving the stuffing of ballot boxes with unaccounted for ballots.</seg>
<seg id="28">Members of the commission also did not support the suggestion made by their colleague from A Just Russia, Maria Popova, via the regional electoral commission, to introduce amendments to regional legislation in order to clearly establish the time at which envelopes containing early voting ballots, which then end up in ballot boxes, are opened.</seg>
<seg id="29">"As concerns this individual initiative: at least contact the Central Election Committee", Aleksandr Makeev advised Ms. Popova.</seg>
<seg id="30">Towards the end of the meeting, Sergei Samokhin, a member of the CPRF, began to hurl loud accusations at the chairman, yelling that the electoral commission was ignoring dozens of complaints and concealing electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="31">"You're not at a protest; be more careful with your claims!" replied the offended chairman of the electoral commission.</seg>
<seg id="32">Ultimately, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="33">The electoral commission must confirm the overall results of the elections by September 27, after which, within a period of three weeks, the first meeting of the sixth convocation of the Nizhny Novgorod City Duma will be announced.</seg>
<seg id="34">In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the city electoral commission denied the Communists of Russia political party's registration of an advocacy group to conduct a local referendum.</seg>
<seg id="35">According to the documents, the party members were planning on bringing up two issues for discussion with residents of Nizhny Novgorod: do you agree that the collection of fees for capital repairs to apartment blocks should be "immediately cancelled", and should rates for housing and communal services "be frozen until 2020".</seg>
<seg id="36">However, lawyer for the Duma, Irina Maslova, made it clear that the appeal by the Communists of Russia contravenes the law.</seg>

<seg id="1">FedEx earnings mixed, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx reported disappointing results for its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="4">At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday's opening bell.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said that it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, down 20 cents from an earlier prediction.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.</seg>
<seg id="8">The reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes averaging 4.9 percent, which will take effect Jan. 4, and higher surcharges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages, which begin in November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and growth in online commerce.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was "performing solidly given weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."</seg>
<seg id="11">The holiday-hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said that that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same that it hired last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, short of the $2.44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the latest quarter, ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates, while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs.</seg>
<seg id="20">In premarket trading about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares were down $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.</seg>
<seg id="21">They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.</seg>

<seg id="1">At their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table deciding if it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">Looming over them at one end of the central bank's ornate, two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above all others.</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank has a dual charge from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there's an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And that third mandate could be the X-factor in a too-close-to-predict decision, to be announced Thursday, about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being weaned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even though most data show the economy growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-cautious Fed officials skittish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There's no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing financial market jitters.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">Financial markets, however, are expecting the Fed to hold off, with a key indicator showing only about a 30% chance of a boost.</seg>
<seg id="13">That would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate, unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point in time," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If Fed policymakers did, "they would have to go to great lengths in their policy statement to hold financial markets' hands so they don't panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would validate the strength of the U.S. recovery.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been solid this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.</seg>
<seg id="24">And although inflation continued to run below the central bank's annual 2% target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But financial markets around the world started convulsing late last month after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% from the May high.</seg>
<seg id="29">For Fed policymakers, the market turmoil adds to the complex calculus of when to raise the interest rate.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks, they would be tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy are going to be, and they have almost no data to rely on that post-dates the developments in China," Oliner said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the global economy isn't one of the Fed's primary concerns, so technically it shouldn't be factored into its decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But, in effect, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "taper" its monetary expansion triggered market convulsions around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that seem unconnected to economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase, cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point over three meetings "despite limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market meltdown, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latest turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"You certainly don't want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think they should get ahead of the curve.</seg>

<seg id="2">Interfax reports that he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I'm not a proponent of conspiracy theories, but the question begs to be asked: Is Europe itself the ultimate goal of those who, with such maniacal perseverance over the past few years, have destabilised the situation in the countries of Northern Africa and the Middle East?" he questioned.</seg>
<seg id="4">"After all, surely someone assumed and knew that the influx of refugees, these unfortunate and wretched people who are trying to escape death, would pour into the affluent countries of the EU", he added.</seg>
<seg id="5">Naryshkin asked: "How many political leaders in Europe have honestly spoken about the causes of this crisis, about this wave of refugees, which is literally washing over their countries right now?"</seg>
<seg id="6">"No, Old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent", he stated.</seg>

<seg id="1">The President of Syria names the reason for the West's enmity towards Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2">The West's grievances towards countries like Syria, Russia, and Iran, in fact stem from the fact that they are sovereign states.</seg>
<seg id="3">Syrian President Bashar al-Assad expressed this opinion in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia-24, NTV, Rossiya Segodnya, TASS, Interfax, and Rossiyskaya Gazeta.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Assad, the West cannot accept partners and sovereign states.</seg>
<seg id="5">In these countries, they would like to remove one person and replace them with another person who will act in the interests of Western countries and not in the interests of their homeland, he noted.</seg>
<seg id="6">Assad drew attention to the abrupt shift in Western media since the beginning of the revolution in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "transformed from being a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator, who represses the Russian opposition, and who came to power through undemocratic means, in spite of the fact that he was chosen via democratic elections recognised in the West".</seg>
<seg id="8">Putin urged the international community to join forces with Assad in the fight against Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="9">Commenting on frequent statements by the West that Assad must leave, he noted that a president comes to power with the consent of the people, via elections, and if he is to leave, then it is at the behest of the people, and not according to a decision by the US, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference, or a Geneva communiqué.</seg>
<seg id="10">"If the people want him to stay, the president will stay, and if the opposite is true, then he ought to leave immediately", he underscored.</seg>
<seg id="11">Assad described Russia and Iran as friendly countries and recalled that they are cooperating with them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Syria is also jointly fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="13">Speaking about military assistance from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, on the economy, and in the military sphere.</seg>
<seg id="14">He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tehran is providing us with military equipment.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Of course there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran; however, this exchange has always been in place", he explained.</seg>
<seg id="17">As concerns other states, we are open to cooperation with any of them if they possess a serious willingness to combat terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We do not see this in relation to the so-called antiterrorist and anti-ISIS coalition led by the US", Assad pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="19">The death toll has surpassed 230 thousand people, and the number of refugees has reached 11.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">A portion of territory has been seized by the terrorist group, Islamic State, which is banned in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The international coalition headed by the US is striking at IS positions from the air.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is noted that the topic of conversation was the conflict in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, Kirby didn't offer any additional details.</seg>
<seg id="6">Moreover, he stated that the US has tools to "further isolate Russia" if the country continues to support the President of Syria Bashar al-Assad, RIA Novosti reports.</seg>
<seg id="7">As reported by the Russian MFA, during his conversation with Kerry, Lavrov once again stressed the need to create a united front in the fight against terrorist groups active within the territory of that country.</seg>
<seg id="8">Approaches to resolving the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps towards decreasing tensions on the Korean peninsula were also discussed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Additionally, they touched on some issues of a bilateral nature.</seg>
<seg id="10">Earlier, American officials stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern regarding Moscow's strengthening of support for Assad.</seg>
<seg id="11">Washington stated that if Russia continues to provide support to Assad, then it would be increasingly isolated from the international community.</seg>
<seg id="12">In response, the Russian President's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov stated that the country would not face international isolation.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Aleksandr Borodai, has denied information that was published in the US newspaper, The Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="3">He spoke about this in a telephone interview with a correspondent from Lenta.ru.</seg>
<seg id="4">The article in The Washington Post is wonderful in that everything is entirely misquoted.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course, no one tied up Igor Strelkov, the former Minister of Defence for the DPR, and he 'left' the territory of the Donbass Republic in entirely high spirits, without any ropes and without the three truckloads of money that are being ascribed to him by various people", he noted.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Borodai, there definitely was talk about Strelkov during the conversation with the reporter from the US newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Yes, I said that Strelkov needed to be immediately removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic", said the former head of government for the DPR.</seg>
<seg id="8">Borodai stressed that he didn't know why the reporter from the US publication decided to write that Strelkov was "tied up" while being removed to Russian territory.</seg>
<seg id="9">I suspect that this is a provocation.</seg>
<seg id="10">If it's not a provocation, then it's a surprising case of miscommunication, since I stressed that Strelkov left on his own", Borodai noted.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's libel against me and Strelkov", he concluded.</seg>
<seg id="12">Earlier, an article appeared on the pages of The Washington Post, in which Borodai was quoted as saying that he forcibly removed Strelkov to Russian territory.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the publication, Borodai stated that he was forced to tie-up his associate.</seg>

<seg id="2">Polish loggers have begun cutting down trees over an underground tunnel where, according to some reports, a train containing gold from the Third Reich is located.</seg>
<seg id="3">Work commenced on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to military experts, the forest must be cleared in order to confirm the veracity of rumours about the train containing treasure.</seg>
<seg id="5">There could be weapons and valuable minerals inside of the train.</seg>
<seg id="6">On August 31, the Governor for Poland's Lower Silesia Province, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that new evidence about the existence of a train containing gold were no more convincing than previous claims.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nevertheless, the authorities decided to cordon-off search areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Three days earlier, Poland's Deputy Minister of Culture, Piotr Zuchowski, stated that local treasure hunters, "with a 99 percent degree of certainty", had found the very same train containing gold from the Third Reich that is talked about in the legends.</seg>
<seg id="9">Zuchowski noted that if the speculation turns out to be true and the treasure is found, it will become property of the state treasury, in which case, the treasure will not be handed over to Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the middle of August, two clients of a law firm notified the authorities of the Polish city of Wałbrzych that they had found a train in a walled-in tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russia's chief narcologist has proposed prohibiting the sale of tobacco before the age of 21.</seg>
<seg id="3">Evgeny Bryun noted that, before this age, "any psychotropic substance - tobacco, alcohol, narcotics - has a particularly harmful effect".</seg>
<seg id="4">This is what he said in a live broadcast on Govorit Moskva radio station, while commenting on information that the Speaker of the Federation Council, Valentina Matviyenko, supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens younger than 21 years old.</seg>
<seg id="5">The individual develops irregularly.</seg>
<seg id="6">You can serve in the army from the age of 18; an individual is physically prepared for this.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mentally, they are prepared for a full-fledged life in society by the age of 21.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is well known from scientific evidence that the brain and its biochemistry are only fully developed by the age of 21", Bryun noted.</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier, member of the Public Chamber and Head of the Sober Russia project, Sultan Khamzaev, told Izvestia that Matviyenko supported an initiative to raise the age limit for the sale of alcohol and "jointly agreed with the Public Chamber to once again raise this issue in the upper house of parliament".</seg>

<seg id="2">Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while breastfeeding, by featuring images of babies suckling from breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy food.</seg>
<seg id="3">Human breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to grow a strong immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Due to excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new moms are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, new research suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tumors.</seg>
<seg id="7">Unfortunately, unhealthy diets were found to negatively affect the child's immune system.</seg>

<seg id="1">Doctors call for a ban on boxing.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Board of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries received during a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the International Boxing Federation (IBF), the battle for one of the regional titles in the 57.15 kg weight category, which was held last Friday, ended in a knockout victory for the Filipino in the 12th round.</seg>
<seg id="5">Brown, however, was sent to the hospital with a traumatic brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="6">His condition was assessed as critical and he was connected to life support.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the professional boxing ring, Brown scored 22 victories, suffered only two losses, and had one fight that ended in a draw.</seg>
<seg id="8">He leaves behind two children.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is already the second fatal case amongst Australian boxers over the past six months.</seg>
<seg id="10">In March, Braydon Smith, a 23-year-old student, died from injuries received in the ring.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now the AMA is recommending against participating in this type of sport, or, even better from their point of view, banning it outright.</seg>
<seg id="12">I understand that this happens unintentionally, said the organisation's Vice President Stephen Parnis.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, in the form in which boxing currently exists, these situations, where an athlete suffers a haemorrhage or a brain injury that results in death or serious injury, will continue to happen.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is for this reason that the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.</seg>

<seg id="4">We judge these to be unacceptable actions, as an attack on the value of parliamentary diplomacy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"And this shouldn't happen again, because it is a manifestation of political insolence and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue", the politician said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Moreover, Naryshkin called on members of the PA of the OSCE to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.</seg>
<seg id="7">Let's return morality to politics.</seg>
<seg id="8">Let's return dialogue and the law to the practice of international communication.</seg>

<seg id="1">I only basked in my victory for two or three days.</seg>
<seg id="2">World Champion in Track and Field, Sergei Shubenkov.</seg>
<seg id="3">This season can be called triumphant for the 24-year-old track and field athlete from Barnaul, Sergei Shubenkov.</seg>
<seg id="4">He managed to win at the European Team Championships in his best event, the 110m hurdles, set several records, and, most importantly, become world champion, moreover, the first in our nation's history of sprint hurdles.</seg>
<seg id="5">Furthermore, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, taking third place in the overall rankings.</seg>
<seg id="6">Novye Izvestia asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the past season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sergei, is the season not over for you yet?</seg>
<seg id="8">That's right, I'm planning to compete at the Military World Games, which will be held this October in Korea, and then I will think about taking a rest.</seg>
<seg id="9">Of course, right now, I will be training at home, in Barnaul, but being at home is still quite another situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Anything is easier than travelling around the world every week.</seg>
<seg id="11">You once said that autumn is your favourite time of year.</seg>
<seg id="12">The end of August and beginning of September is a wonderful time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The passions from the start of the main season have simmered down, and the weight of responsibility isn't so heavy.</seg>
<seg id="14">You can compete for enjoyment, in a "laid back" state.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, you know that your break is coming up soon...</seg>
<seg id="16">And do you get fatigued?</seg>
<seg id="17">After all, it's been an exceptional season, with a multitude of positive emotions...</seg>
<seg id="18">Fatigue always starts to set in towards the end of the season.</seg>
<seg id="19">And here, it's not important whether you won more or lost more.</seg>
<seg id="20">Every competition is stressful.</seg>
<seg id="21">Never-ending flights and travel: it all takes a toll on the body.</seg>
<seg id="22">You get physically and emotionally fatigued.</seg>
<seg id="23">But right now, of course, I'm in good spirits.</seg>
<seg id="24">What am I saying - I couldn't be happier!</seg>
<seg id="25">Do you often think about the moment you crossed the finish line at the World Championships in Beijing?</seg>
<seg id="26">Sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Besides, you journalists won't let me forget about it either.</seg>
<seg id="28">But, in general, I don't think it's good for an athlete to live for their old victories and run through their successful races over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="29">I only basked in my victory for two or three days and then I had to start moving again.</seg>
<seg id="30">Did your preparations for this remarkable season differ significantly from usual?</seg>
<seg id="31">I can't say that there was anything particularly different.</seg>
<seg id="32">We started to train back in December, but I skipped the winter competition season.</seg>
<seg id="33">At first, I trained at home in Barnaul, then at training camps, and then again at home.</seg>
<seg id="34">As per usual.</seg>
<seg id="35">But my coach and I set a goal: to try and reach a new level where I had never been before.</seg>
<seg id="36">I spent almost the entire winter laying down the foundations for this.</seg>
<seg id="37">I ran lots of cross-country, did exercises for overall physical conditioning, which included lifting and squats, and we built up my back muscles.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then we moved onto hurdles training, and worked a lot on technique.</seg>
<seg id="39">Did you keep an eye on how your competitors were performing?</seg>
<seg id="40">I always try and do this, and it's an advantage of the Internet age that there aren't any issues with this.</seg>
<seg id="41">I watched the European Winter Championships, and the French swept the whole podium in sprint hurdles!</seg>
<seg id="42">Then I thought: I need to do something to break up this group.</seg>
<seg id="43">With each race this season, you kept on improving your results.</seg>
<seg id="44">Did this give you confidence?</seg>
<seg id="45">All of my previous seasons have unfolded in pretty much the same way.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was never a time when I was first running 13.20 and then would run 13.50.</seg>
<seg id="47">I always work out my form gradually.</seg>
<seg id="48">The most important thing is that I wanted to run it in under 13 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="49">Every effort was directed, first and foremost, on achieving this result.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the paradox is that, even though you feel prepared for this feat, you aren't always able to show your readiness to do this at competitions.</seg>
<seg id="51">Like how it was at the London Olympics for example?</seg>
<seg id="52">To be honest, I tried to forget that semi-final race right away (Shubenkov wasn't able to make it to the finals - Ed.).</seg>
<seg id="53">I was very well prepared, and could have run it in under 13 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="54">And even if I had repeated my best result at that time, I would have been the bronze medallist at the Games.</seg>
<seg id="55">But it just didn't work out.</seg>
<seg id="56">Do you remember your first world championships?</seg>
<seg id="57">What do you think?</seg>
<seg id="58">It was in Daegu.</seg>
<seg id="59">I really wanted to make it into the finals back then; that was kind of the ultimate goal.</seg>
<seg id="60">But I got knocked out first thing in the morning, during the preliminary races.</seg>
<seg id="61">That's when I understood that recklessly rushing headlong into it meant that I wasn't going to get anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="62">Two years later at the World Championships in Moscow, I had already made it into the finals with a better time.</seg>
<seg id="63">I remember well how I felt before the final race: I really wanted to win the gold even back then!</seg>
<seg id="64">How do you manage to build-up a decent speed and still not lose your head or tune-out?</seg>
<seg id="65">Well, this is the most difficult thing.</seg>
<seg id="66">You need to be careful and focused on technique in order to not knock down the hurdles.</seg>
<seg id="67">I've noticed that when you aren't fixated on the end result, but on the process, it's a lot easier.</seg>
<seg id="68">But the greatest rush is when you realise that you're running and everything seems to be working out on its own!</seg>
<seg id="69">Honestly, it's well worth it.</seg>
<seg id="70">A lot of our athletes from the provinces aim to move closer to the capital after their first notable successes.</seg>
<seg id="71">Have you ever had those thoughts?</seg>
<seg id="72">Home is always better.</seg>
<seg id="73">And I can't even imagine where I'd be without my coach; who needs me?</seg>
<seg id="74">It might be nice to have slightly better conditions, but I try to be content with what I have.</seg>
<seg id="75">Have you and Klevtsovy been together for a long time?</seg>
<seg id="76">Since I was 12 years old, when I first started track and field.</seg>
<seg id="77">Actually, I started training with his wife, who worked with the children, and then later she passed me on.</seg>
<seg id="78">I started with sprinting, then long jump and triple jump.</seg>
<seg id="79">There was a children's combined event: that's when they toss a ball and long jump from that spot...</seg>
<seg id="80">At 14, I tried the hurdles and liked them.</seg>
<seg id="81">With my very first race, I was able to qualify for the second adult category.</seg>
<seg id="82">So I just stayed with it.</seg>
<seg id="83">Have you ever been stricken with fear in front of the hurdles?</seg>
<seg id="84">Somehow I was able to work things out with them right away.</seg>
<seg id="85">But I've always had to put a lot of work into my technique.</seg>
<seg id="86">I worked for so long on just one stride!</seg>
<seg id="87">But there is no way around this routine.</seg>
<seg id="88">Your technique needs to be constantly honed, so that you could wake me up in the middle of the night, and I would get up and run hurdles.</seg>
<seg id="89">Everyone that saw your race in Beijing claims that it was a really beautiful race.</seg>
<seg id="90">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="91">I quite enjoyed it myself.</seg>
<seg id="92">Usually I don't re-watch my races, but with this one I couldn't hold myself back.</seg>
<seg id="93">But you have to keep working on efficiency: there's always room for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="94">Are you now afraid that a victory one year before the Olympic Games will weigh like a heavy burden on your shoulders?</seg>
<seg id="95">As people say in situations like this: I will try to live up to expectations.</seg>
<seg id="96">Since I've chosen to take this road, that means that I have to see it through to the end.</seg>
<seg id="97">My coach loves to say: if you're not a weakling, you shouldn't feel any extra weight.</seg>
<seg id="98">And I completely agree with him on this.</seg>

<seg id="5">That tyranny of distance didn't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers with Sunrise averaging 397,000 viewers across the five capital cities to Today's 339,000.</seg>
<seg id="6">Today scored a slight uptick compared to its ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) but its figure was behind last Thursday's (343,000).</seg>
<seg id="7">Today has been closing the gap on Sunrise in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="8">In August, Today averaged 318,000 to Sunrise's 330,000.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the start of the year the gap was running at between 40,000 and 50,000.</seg>

<seg id="16">The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to relocate to seaside New Zealand with his two children, averaged a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Critics had wondered whether Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last night's result answered that with a resounding "yes."</seg>

<seg id="21">The first half-hour (5pm to 5.30pm) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.</seg>
<seg id="22">The second half-hour (5.30pm to 6pm) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).</seg>

<seg id="25">The Chase Australia's second night ratings drop will have Nine quietly confident that Hot Seat will ultimately prevail at 5.30.</seg>

<seg id="4">The woman who Sam Wood ends up with on The Bachelor has been swathed in utmost secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="5">And the three girls left standing certainly aren't letting slip whether they are the one who received his final rose.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two, they may have inadvertently given away a clue as to who the winner will be.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's finale</seg>
<seg id="8">All three women waxed lyrical over why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner.</seg>
<seg id="9">However when asked the question, "If not you, who should get Wood's final rose?," their answers could have provided a spoiler as to who won the Bachelors heart.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as, apart from themselves, the best match for Wood.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared an easy rapport since day one.</seg>
<seg id="12">"From the moment I walked into the house, reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Sarah is really down to earth, she's so much fun to be around," added Markoski.</seg>
<seg id="14">I've seen them together and they do have that chemistry there.</seg>
<seg id="15">They do feel nice and comfortable with each other.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.</seg>
<seg id="17">For her part, Mackay said last week's home visit dates made her realise Wood could be "the one."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Once I saw him with my friends and family I realised this obviously isn't just a game - I'm wholeheartedly invested in him now," she said.</seg>
<seg id="19">And asked who Wood should choose if not her, she was enigmatic.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jarryd Hayne had several options of where to begin his NFL career.</seg>
<seg id="2">Detroit and Seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it's looking like a wise decision.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some coaches would have benched Hayne for the rest of the game for losing a fumble like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return in Tuesday's 20-3 win against Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Tomsula showed faith in his man, giving Hayne the next opportunity to return a punt and including him in the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tomsula continued to show his true colours in the locker room after the game.</seg>
<seg id="7">Instead of chewing out his rookies in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tomsula also backed Hayne publicly in his post-match press conference.</seg>
<seg id="9">49ers beat reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jarryd Hayne fumbles a punt that was recovered by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter</seg>
<seg id="11">It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hayne was seen cursing as he made his way from the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It was just one of those things, you just worry about the next play and that's it," said Hayne.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-goal led to a Queensland try.</seg>
<seg id="15">Overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it to his Instagram.</seg>

<seg id="2">Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.</seg>
<seg id="6">Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death toll.</seg>
<seg id="8">The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dilute their political influence.</seg>
<seg id="9">There have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic Tharus who want their own state.</seg>
<seg id="10">At least 40 people, including 11 police officials, have been killed in violent clashes since Aug.</seg>
<seg id="11">10, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.</seg>

<seg id="1">Sayansk plans to establish a 900-job facility.</seg>
<seg id="2">Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk region.</seg>
<seg id="3">It was built in the 1970s as a chemical industry centre and has well-developed infrastructure requiring systemic support.</seg>
<seg id="4">A year ago, a new mayor, Oleg Borovsky, took over leadership of Sayansk.</seg>
<seg id="5">He spoke with a correspondent from Oblastnaya about the results of the first year of work, new projects, and future possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="6">Oleg Valeryevich, how did you begin your work as mayor?</seg>
<seg id="7">First of all, I familiarised myself with the results of the audit of financial and economic activities, and I initiated an independent audit of municipal budget expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="8">Next, a review of municipal assets was conducted.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of the first practical steps was cutting the turnover time for documentation down to five days.</seg>
<seg id="10">Previously, documents could take months to get through the proper channels.</seg>
<seg id="11">Initiatives to increase the revenue base and optimise spending were developed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, in November, an on-site government meeting was held in Sayansk where issues concerning the socioeconomic development of the territory were discussed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The city didn't have design and estimation documentation (DED) for even a single asset.</seg>
<seg id="14">Without this, Sayansk couldn't participate in federal programmes.</seg>
<seg id="15">We started with DEDs for the roads, childcare facilities, and the northern sewage and water line.</seg>
<seg id="16">Right now, roadwork is already underway in two areas.</seg>
<seg id="17">How is the RF Presidential Decree on the construction of childcare facilities being applied in the city?</seg>
<seg id="18">In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.</seg>
<seg id="19">The city hasn't seen positive demographic indicators like this for the past 27 years.</seg>
<seg id="20">As such, ensuring spaces in childcare facilities is one of the most relevant issues.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since September 1, childcare facility No. 10 has been closed for capital repairs designed to create 320 spaces.</seg>
<seg id="22">The estimated cost of the renovation is 86 mln roubles.</seg>
<seg id="23">Before now, the city had never received such funds.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last year, following renovations, childcare facility No.23 was opened and is now attended by 200 children.</seg>
<seg id="25">The renovation was carried out via co-financing from the regional and municipal budgets and cost more than 67 mln roubles.</seg>
<seg id="26">Thanks to the efforts of the administration and assistance from the regional government, the money to purchase furniture and equipment was found, and the People's Initiative also helped out with this.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are plans to start building a new childcare facility in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="28">With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the waitlist for children from 18 months to three years.</seg>
<seg id="29">We don't have waitlists for children from three to seven years old.</seg>
<seg id="30">Are investors expressing interest in the area?</seg>
<seg id="31">We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be carried out, first and foremost, by Sayansk businesses: we need to provide jobs specifically for them.</seg>
<seg id="32">In October, a 60-apartment building will be opened for orphaned children in Leningradsky microdistrict.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as construction is concerned, I will add that Sayansk is one of four cities in Irkutsk region that has been included in a programme to build economy-class housing.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the required documentation has been prepared.</seg>
<seg id="35">Construction of a 90-block section will commence soon.</seg>
<seg id="36">Altogether we have announced the construction of 10 thousand square metres of housing, and there are many wanting to participate in the programme.</seg>
<seg id="37">One of the requirements is that the housing must not cost more than 30 thousand roubles per square metre, and that it should be a "turnkey" property at this price.</seg>
<seg id="38">If we can handle the specified scope, then we will continue to participate in the programme.</seg>
<seg id="39">As far as investors are concerned, we also have other interesting projects.</seg>
<seg id="40">Back in the day, a pig farm was built in Sayansk that was sold, in 2004, for a pittance.</seg>
<seg id="41">We are working with the prosecutor's office to protest this transaction.</seg>
<seg id="42">Especially since the land underneath the facility is federal property.</seg>
<seg id="43">We are working with Moscow to resolve the issue of a transfer of 88 hectares of property to the region, and the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a potential investor who is ready to put 1.5 bln roubles into the redevelopment and launch of the project.</seg>
<seg id="45">We will gain 900 jobs with the launch of the pig farm, which will be a big help to the city.</seg>
<seg id="46">Is the institute of social partnership developed in Sayansk?</seg>
<seg id="47">We have concluded approximately 140 socio-economic partnership agreements.</seg>
<seg id="48">The implementation of many projects was made possible thanks to the active social position of business representatives.</seg>
<seg id="49">Tangible support has been provided by enterprises such as: CJSC Vostok-Tsentr, Novo-Ziminskaya Thermal Power Plant, LLC Sayanski Broiler, and LLC PC MDF; the management of these enterprises responds to all of our requests.</seg>
<seg id="50">Right before City Day, LLC Sayanski Broiler presented the city with a playground, and the company, Vostok-Tsentr, carried out a renovation of an equestrian yard, where specialists work with children using hippotherapy, spending more than 1 mln roubles on it.</seg>
<seg id="51">Thanks to funds donated by sponsors, we managed to make improvements to the grounds of the city's civil registry office.</seg>
<seg id="52">The sponsors helped us to vibrantly celebrate City Day.</seg>
<seg id="53">As in the good old days, a parade, featuring the city's collectives and organisations, was held.</seg>
<seg id="54">We released a city chronicle and a book of Sayansk's poets.</seg>
<seg id="55">The first builders and people who have made a significant contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded with commemorative medals.</seg>
<seg id="56">Patrons also participate in the work of the city's charitable foundation.</seg>
<seg id="57">The first step was the purchase of musical instruments for talented young musicians.</seg>
<seg id="58">In nine months, more than 800 thousand roubles have been allocated to support these talented kids, to help children who require expensive treatments, and to support children from low-income families.</seg>
<seg id="59">How are staffing issues in the social services sector dealt with in Sayansk?</seg>
<seg id="60">The city doesn't have enough doctors or subject teachers.</seg>
<seg id="61">Providing specialists with housing is critically important to solving the staffing issue.</seg>
<seg id="62">Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments to doctors, and four teachers have received service housing.</seg>
<seg id="63">We have a programme for the allocation of housing with the option to privatise it after five years.</seg>
<seg id="64">There are plans to reconfigure a building, in which another eight apartments for teachers will be built.</seg>
<seg id="65">Teachers and doctors also participate in the programme "Housing for Russian Families".</seg>
<seg id="66">Over the longer term, we will construct housing for public sector employees.</seg>
<seg id="67">Most importantly, our city has a hard-working team with which I am able to solve the most complex issues.</seg>
<seg id="68">It's critical to draw the right conclusions from each crisis, and life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="69">The potential of Sayansk and of our region is great.</seg>

<seg id="7">But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperate for help.</seg>
<seg id="8">The donations will go toward four nonprofit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</seg>
<seg id="9">Google said it will match the first $5.5 million worth of donations globally at google.com/refugeerelief until it raises $11 million.</seg>
<seg id="10">Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely driven by the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.</seg>

<seg id="1">For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's still to early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments, however.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data take a long time to show up," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight loss operations, or bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, bariatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies were done in people who are morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the BMI among those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those who had surgery, diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medically-treated group, by comparison, diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.</seg>
<seg id="19">After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medical therapy group, however, it remained steady at about 8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected by the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved larger drops in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and in hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Though the new study didn't show a benefit in survival among surgery patients, Blackstone said it's reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is where this paper is critical, because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BMI group," with no increased risk of death or renal disease, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that once they've accumulated these genetic changes that hardwired their bodies into obesity and diabetes, reversing that is really hard.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fans from Europe risk becoming homeless.</seg>
<seg id="2">Only 23 hotels in Saint Petersburg have the right to house the tourists who will arrive in 2018 to watch the World Cup in football.</seg>
<seg id="3">So far, the rest of the hotels haven't been rushing to get the necessary permit.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, this is a very worrisome sign.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the lead up to the world championship, the authorities need to urgently figure out how to accommodate all the city's guests.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rosbalt's informants believe that apartment rents will rise by 10-30% as a result of the tournament, and, even after the championship, it will be necessary to pay through the nose for rented accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="7">The world championship in football has forced the authorities to take a look at the state of Russian hotels.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to a law specifically written for the championship, every hotel in Saint Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that they meet their alleged star rating and level of service.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is already clear that not everyone will manage to do this: hoteliers are so apprehensive about the screening process that they frequently aren't even submitting request documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Saint Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="10">Head of the Office of the Federal Antimonopoly Service, Vadim Vladimirov, says that the agency has investigated 138 hotels and now plans on initiating 34 cases against hotels, many of which have simply not responded to FAS staff.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are signs that the management of thirty companies were deceiving city residents by alleging a certain number of stars in advertisements, Vladimirov noted.</seg>
<seg id="12">The problem is that now, ahead of 2018, literally not even one room from the overall total can be lost.</seg>
<seg id="13">Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will occupy all of Saint Petersburg's hotels.</seg>
<seg id="14">Currently, tourists can depend on 30,500 rooms in the city.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to data from the Smolny Institute, there are 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two and three-star hotels, and 550 one-star hotels in Saint Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to First Deputy of the Committee for the Development of Tourism, Nana Gvichiya, at the present moment, only 23 hotels have undergone classification: this is the number of inspections that have been conducted by the companies accredited in Saint Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, the Smolny Institute, for a surprising set of circumstances, doesn't know whether or not some hotels could have ordered a similar procedure from regional businesses.</seg>
<seg id="18">In other words, there may be more hotels that have undergone classification, but no one knows about it.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Over the past six months, hotels have not been very interested in undergoing classification", admitted the Director of the Northwestern branch of the Russian Tourism Industry Union, Ekaterina Shadskaya.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is explained by it being peak season, the time when hoteliers make the most money and don't want to be dealing with other issues.</seg>
<seg id="21">Another reason is their budgets, which didn't include expenses for inspections, especially since the procedure could cost a hotel, depending on its status, between 30 thousand to 100 thousand roubles or more.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, more recently, hotel managers have woken up and started to apply for classification, assured Shadskaya.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hotels must get this done by July 1, 2016; otherwise, they will not only have to pay a fine, but also will not receive the right to operate during the world championship.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is already well known that, based on star ratings, a set rate per hotel room for the duration of the tournament will be developed.</seg>
<seg id="25">The formulas, according to which prices will be set, will be published next year.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is done to ensure that there isn't a 200-300% spike in prices, as happens, for example, during the Saint Petersburg Economic Forum.</seg>
<seg id="27">You have to have a conscience and prevent a two-threefold price hike, while also enabling hotels to make money.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I think there will be a 50% increase", explained President of the Russian Hotel Association, Gennady Lamshin.</seg>
<seg id="29">Whereas Vadim Vladimirov isn't convinced that fixing prices corresponds with the notion of a free market economy.</seg>
<seg id="30">I don't know how well it fits within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.</seg>
<seg id="31">"It's better than rampant price increases", he noted.</seg>
<seg id="32">It's not clear what will happen with popular inexpensive hostels.</seg>
<seg id="33">State Duma deputies have introduced a bill that would prohibit hostels in residential buildings.</seg>
<seg id="34">We really hope that this law is not adopted or that it won't apply to Saint Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="35">"We will defend our point of view, that hostels should be maintained", says Nana Gvachiya.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, according to her, owners of mini-hotels, should, in any case, be ready for a tightening of the Housing Code.</seg>
<seg id="37">If the State Duma ends up approving the bill, then approximately 80% of the hostels in Saint Petersburg will be closed, and currently, they account for 1,500 rooms.</seg>
<seg id="38">According to the President of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers for the Northwest, Leonid Garbar, there aren't enough two and three-star hotels in Saint Petersburg, which are exactly what football fans are looking for, whereas there is an overabundance of four and five-star hotels.</seg>
<seg id="39">This state of affairs is equivalent to a situation where "you have 75 thousand VIPs in an 80-thousand-person stadium".</seg>
<seg id="40">In fact, making use of mini-hotels can solve this issue.</seg>
<seg id="41">The expert considers their possible ban to be "idiocy": "I find it strange that some people can live in apartments, but out-of-towners, for some reason, cannot".</seg>
<seg id="42">If a hostel is being used like a dormitory, then I agree that this is not right.</seg>
<seg id="43">But if it is being used like a hotel, where guests stay for a short period of time, then why not?</seg>
<seg id="44">Mini-hotels also risk missing out during the world championship in football as a result of their own foot-dragging.</seg>
<seg id="45">Hundreds of small hotels will simply not manage to undergo classification in time, what's more is that they are digging their own hole.</seg>
<seg id="46">By the summer of 2016, all the city's hotels will be booking inspections.</seg>
<seg id="47">"There aren't that many companies that are allowed to carry out this procedure, and, as such, they will turn down the less profitable orders from mini-hotels and will choose those that are more expensive", noted Gennady Lamshin, adding that, in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the figure for those that have already completed inspections is currently much higher than for those in Saint Petersburg.</seg>
<seg id="48">The reason for Saint Petersburg's delay is related in part to constant changes in the government's tourism unit, which has not be conducive to coordinated efforts.</seg>
<seg id="49">According to experts, if there aren't enough hotels in Saint Petersburg for everyone, then, most likely, attention will have to be shifted towards regional hotels and health resorts.</seg>
<seg id="50">Just as during the celebration of Saint Petersburg's 300th anniversary, a river fleet could be mobilised, which would enable tournament guests to stay in ship cabins.</seg>
<seg id="51">Besides, many fans have arranged to arrive in vans, in which they could spend the night.</seg>
<seg id="52">"The main thing is to not build so many hotels, that they later end up sitting empty", assured Gennady Lamshin.</seg>
<seg id="53">Rented accommodations will also be very popular during the football championship.</seg>
<seg id="54">A pool of apartments available for rent in the city will most likely be created.</seg>
<seg id="55">Rental rates will rise by 10-30%.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Obviously, the first to go will be housing near the stadium", noted rent specialist for the Agency for the Development and Study of Real Estate, Larisa Bragina.</seg>
<seg id="57">Moreover, rent prices might not return to previous levels after the championship, especially in commuter communities.</seg>
<seg id="58">This will also contribute to the construction of new traffic interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she underscored.</seg>
<seg id="59">One shouldn't forget about the human qualities of city residents.</seg>
<seg id="60">For example, Leonid Garbar insists that Saint Petersburg has always been a welcoming city, where people not only provide you with directions, but might also take you on a mini-excursion.</seg>
<seg id="61">There can also be complications.</seg>
<seg id="62">Sometime around 1970, my father met a family from Murmansk in the courtyard: a father, mother, and two children.</seg>
<seg id="63">It turned out they had nowhere to spend the night: getting a hotel was difficult back then and sleeping at the train station was tough.</seg>
<seg id="64">"So my father let them into our communal apartment to sleep", our interviewee recalled.</seg>
<seg id="65">Of course, he added that, nowadays, this type of trait no longer exists amongst the city's residents - inviting someone into your home is fraught with consequences and frightening.</seg>
<seg id="66">But, perhaps, in 2018, after the ill-fated decisions of the State Duma, and the mistakes of hoteliers and the government, we might be required to recall the past?</seg>

<seg id="1">Zhirinovsky "loses" Amur region.</seg>
<seg id="2">Today, I watched the buffoonery of Zhirinovsky in the State Duma with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="3">He was doing these things when our generation was still learning how to sell newspapers, and remains in excellent form to this very day.</seg>
<seg id="4">The theme of the address was something along the lines of "LDPR's protest against the results of the elections in Amur region".</seg>
<seg id="5">He can't wave around protocols that he doesn't have; by all accounts, LDPR doesn't have any other protocols than those signed by the electoral commissions.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then he brings up the second place winner, Ivan Abramov, and yells something like: "Here's the winner of the election!"</seg>
<seg id="7">And then, from no reason, he starts attacking Rodina, and then, after the ruckus with the chairperson this time, he leads the fraction out of the meeting hall, while literally crying out: "All of you and your fronts are crooks and thieves".</seg>
<seg id="8">The press, of course, places the emphasis not on Abramov, but on the scandal and the fraction's walkout as a consequence of this scandal and insult.</seg>
<seg id="9">In reality, Volfovich beautifully and elegantly lost Amur Region along with Abramov.</seg>
<seg id="10">For the whole country, this was just another one of Zhirinovsky's escapades in the same vein as his "Scumbag!" tirade, and not at all a protest by a political party against the results of an actual election.</seg>
<seg id="11">Yet the fraction has formally made a row of it, and the elections, if we are to believe the party's website and Ivan Abramov's Facebook account, have not been confirmed, but the leader has obviously backed away from the issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">He lets the dead in Amur bury their own dead, but then he preaches against United Russia in general, and against Rodina, which is guilty of nothing at all.</seg>
<seg id="13">An elegant solution to save face and, for the time being, avoid a loud scandal.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's an entirely different matter that Abramov now finds himself in an odd position.</seg>
<seg id="15">Other than an outcry from the leadership, he wasn't expecting anything: there are no alternative protocols available.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the one hand, he isn't the focus of the public's attention, but on the other, for a small circle of people, he became the formal reason for both an insult against a respected champion, and, even more importantly, boorish attacks against United Russia and the All-Russia People's Front (APF).</seg>
<seg id="17">And here, of course, it's necessary for him to think very seriously about what needs to be done.</seg>
<seg id="18">Because he could turn from being the main beneficiary of the elections, the number 2 politician in the region, and the number 1 candidate in the only regional single-seat constituency, into a pariah who was successfully used by his own party's leadership and its provocateur-extraordinaire for the benefit of that same APF and someone else's party leadership.</seg>
<seg id="19">Well, if Zhirinovsky didn't exist, then it definitely would be necessary to invent him and dutifully follow his every move.</seg>
<seg id="20">Trump has a lot of work to do to catch up with him.</seg>
<seg id="21">There is news that LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary session.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is to say: all that fuss for nothing.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only, the Abramov issue has been buried under itself.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's beautiful really.</seg>

<seg id="2">Europe could not host all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees" home countries.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="5">He claimed that, under current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also stressed that, however admirable, the West-European countries" response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">"So taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring genuine peace and genuine development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">We have to reduce the use of force.</seg>
<seg id="12">The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.</seg>
<seg id="13">Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US" violent response engendered a chain of uncontrollable events.</seg>
<seg id="14">After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-violence.</seg>
<seg id="15">I know his motives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fourfold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in last 4 years</seg>
<seg id="2">Poison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent uptick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing highly-alcoholic hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, hand sanitizer ingestion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Kids are getting into these products more frequently, and unfortunately, there's a percentage of them going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said some kids are drinking sanitizer intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or on a social-media dare.</seg>
<seg id="6">Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking sanitizer for a cheap buzz.</seg>
<seg id="7">Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink.</seg>
<seg id="8">Younger children can be drawn to attractive sanitizer scents.</seg>
<seg id="9">"A kid is not thinking this is bad for them," Lopez said.</seg>
<seg id="10">A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">In young children, especially, only a few squirts can cause alcohol poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.</seg>
<seg id="15">So you wouldn't leave a shot of whiskey sitting around, but people will have these hand sanitizers out and if kids get into it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested as many as four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her blood-alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could have been very lethal for my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes short of moving hand sanitizer out of a child's reach.</seg>
<seg id="23">Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="25">Health officials surmised that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their "mean" teacher "by putting antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.</seg>
<seg id="27">The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room.</seg>
<seg id="28">Police considered the foiled plan to be "idle chatter," referring discipline to the school district.</seg>

<seg id="1">How the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.</seg>
<seg id="2">A sad cast iron owl sits on the back of a bench by the entrance to the N. K. Krupskaya Regional Children's Library.</seg>
<seg id="3">The kids who come for books try to feed it candies.</seg>
<seg id="4">Several generations already have been coming to this library over the past 95 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first library patrons, from the twenties of the previous century, arranged loud readings, staged performances based on Mayakovsky's poems, held literary quizzes, and corresponded with Lenin's wife.</seg>
<seg id="6">The correspondence lasted for four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalinist" wrote, in 1939, "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and the friends of the children's library in the city of Barnaul" grew stronger each day.</seg>
<seg id="7">One time, Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent her faraway friends in Barnaul a childhood photograph of her.</seg>
<seg id="8">And when the Barnaul residents asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna would mind if the library was named after her, she wrote that, no, she didn't mind.</seg>
<seg id="9">The letters have been collecting dust in the museum for a long time, and it's necessary to explain to the grandchildren and great grandchildren of the first patrons exactly whose stern profile decorates the bas-relief on the library building.</seg>
<seg id="10">During the perestroika years, all sorts of people would often call, filled with indignation: why hasn't the children's library been renamed?</seg>
<seg id="11">The library should be named after some nice children's writer, without political overtones!</seg>
<seg id="12">The library staff sat down together, thought about it, and decided to leave things as they were.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Krupskaya" is probably the most well-known and best-loved library in Barnaul, just like the Lenin Library in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the floor of the library's lobby there is a pathway made from yellow bricks.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favourite theme of artist Olya Moskovka.</seg>
<seg id="16">Previously, Olya was a manager at a law firm; she came into work at eight and left at five, and only differed from the other managers in her love of drawing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then she found an online advertisement: "Book illustrator needed".</seg>
<seg id="18">The book was written by a little American girl and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" ("My mama has cancer").</seg>
<seg id="19">Olya did the illustrations and thought: life can end at any moment, and there won't be any miracles in it if you don't create them yourself.</seg>
<seg id="20">Now she works at the library, illustrates the children's books of authors from around the world, and writes her own short stories.</seg>
<seg id="21">Typically, it's believed that children are losing interest in books; that they are increasingly living in some kind of virtual universe...</seg>
<seg id="22">But children who read visit us, and their parents understand the value of reading, the library's director, Tatiana Kushvid, tells Russian Planet.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent years, we've even felt a sense of confidence, that the children's library is needed, and that it will keep on going - the kids are coming here!</seg>
<seg id="24">I think an interest in reading is making a comeback.</seg>
<seg id="25">A large display window with a temporary photo exhibit hangs in the library's lobby.</seg>
<seg id="26">Once every quarter, new photographs of library patrons that come to the library as a family - mom, dad, and kids - are hung up.</seg>
<seg id="27">The library is thrilled that fathers have started to come more frequently to the library with their children.</seg>
<seg id="28">If they were read all of Chukovsky when they were two years old, then when they are older, they need more challenging books.</seg>
<seg id="29">But now, there is a law whereby we can't give an eight-year-old wunderkind books that are from the 12 and older category.</seg>
<seg id="30">In order to get this book, the child must bring their parents with them; so they come, and come back again, and, slowly but surely, Krupskaya is becoming something like a family club for them.</seg>
<seg id="31">The library contains treasures: a pre-revolutionary collection of folk tales with the old letter "yat" and hard signs, stories by Korolenko in a supplement to the magazine "Niva", and a bound file of "Murzilka" magazines for 1936.</seg>
<seg id="32">After all, nowadays we're not just a conceptual space, a "temple of books", we're now open for movement, and we're trying to become a special place: not home, not work, not school, explains Tatiana Kushvid.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can come to us so that everyone can read together, play together, and draw together.</seg>
<seg id="34">We created a play area for young children: the child has only come to play, but their hand still reaches out for a book!</seg>
<seg id="35">The parents of some of our patrons have to drag their children out, but they dig their heels in and don't want to leave.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moms with their strollers often visit us, and we are really happy that the library comes first amongst all the other places they need to take their babies.</seg>
<seg id="37">Tatiana Kushvid says: today's kids are the same as we used to be; they love classic children's literature:</seg>
<seg id="38">"The publishing industry is growing right now, and a lot of attention is being paid to authors who are the link between generations".</seg>
<seg id="39">If we're talking about little children, then it's important for them that there be some sort of a character that travels from one book to another.</seg>
<seg id="40">Children don't like to say goodbye to their favourite characters.</seg>
<seg id="41">The library is always publishing booklets for parents that talk about what's going on in the world of children's literature, which books are worth paying attention to, and why.</seg>
<seg id="42">The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that the adults ask whether or not the library is in fact for them.</seg>
<seg id="43">Adults aren't allowed to borrow books from the library.</seg>
<seg id="44">Only children have this magical privilege.</seg>
<seg id="45">...In the furthermost room of the library, there is a square hatch with an antique wooden staircase that leads to the basement, into the archive room.</seg>
<seg id="46">The steps will creak with each step you take: it's a very old time machine.</seg>
<seg id="47">You'll meet a book from your childhood as if it were an old comrade: hi, it's wonderful that we haven't changed a bit.</seg>
<seg id="48">Ellie still happily walks along the road paved with yellow bricks; lazy Tolya Ryzhikov steals the magical matches; and Malchish Kibalchish still hasn't told the cursed bourgeouins the Military Secret, such is his solemn word.</seg>
<seg id="49">These books are like passwords: you can use them to recognise your people anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="50">There are also real literary rarities in the archive room: for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of folk tales with the old letter "yat" and hard signs.</seg>
<seg id="51">Or stories by Korolenko in a well-known supplement to the magazine "Niva".</seg>
<seg id="52">Or a bound file of "Murzilka" magazines for 1936.</seg>
<seg id="53">Time has aged the pages, turning them a tea-like colour.</seg>
<seg id="54">These publications aren't given out to library patrons anymore.</seg>
<seg id="55">These are parts of our future collection; I'm always dreaming of retiring and working with rare children's books.</seg>
<seg id="56">But children won't, so to speak, buy into this anymore: the colours in the old books aren't very bright, and the themes...you open the first page and there's Lenin, the Party, and the Komsomol.</seg>
<seg id="57">Now, I think: why did we all subscribe to this "Pioneers Truth"?</seg>
<seg id="58">But still, it was interesting, Galina Ilyasova, head of the archive room, tells Russian Planet.</seg>
<seg id="59">The pages of "Murzilka" have darkened with age.</seg>
<seg id="60">Galina Vasilevna has been in-charge of the archive room her entire life.</seg>
<seg id="61">She knows what colour Buratino's cap is, in which school year Harry Potter became captain for Gryffindor at the Quidditch championships, in which situations Carlson uses his motor silencer, and what Alisa Selezneva's father does for a living.</seg>
<seg id="62">A librarian receives little pay for their work, and those who can live without these rows of books quickly find themselves another profession.</seg>
<seg id="63">Only the most dedicated remain: educators, teachers, and servants of the cult of the book.</seg>
<seg id="64">You can even tell who they are by their smile: it's said that this is a professional trait of a children's librarian.</seg>
<seg id="65">If they smile at you within the first minute of a conversation, then they are a professional.</seg>
<seg id="66">I just love children's books: as a librarian, I like that they are here, that they are sitting nice and tidy on the shelves, and I also love to read them, says Galina Vasilevna.</seg>
<seg id="67">I read everything: military and historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.</seg>
<seg id="68">I read contemporary Russian authors, the latest translations...</seg>
<seg id="69">Of course, I think that things were different in my childhood.</seg>
<seg id="70">Back then, books were the most interesting and exciting thing that had ever happened to me.</seg>
<seg id="71">And this is why I love them madly; I felt that the library was a magical place.</seg>
<seg id="72">And I wanted to work there, where everyone sits and reads.</seg>
<seg id="73">I hope that books will always be around, in spite of readers.</seg>
<seg id="74">And I'm delighted when our former library patrons bring in their children, and even their grandchildren...</seg>

<seg id="5">ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to open up a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.</seg>
<seg id="6">Griffiths plays down disharmony talk</seg>
<seg id="7">It has sparked rumours of disharmony at Celtic, which was dismissed out of hand by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team-mates are not labouring under any sense of increased scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch League leaders.</seg>
<seg id="8">I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lack of Scots title race bores Dutch - de Boer</seg>
<seg id="10">Former Rangers midfielder and ex-Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there's no title rivalry with Rangers.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they don't show highlights of the Celtic games any more and why?"</seg>
<seg id="12">It is because Rangers aren't there.</seg>
<seg id="13">People here don't only talk about Rangers coming back.</seg>
<seg id="14">They talk about the Old Firm.</seg>
<seg id="15">They talk about both teams together and that's what they are interested in.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games and it is not just people in Scotland who want to see those games.</seg>
<seg id="17">I'll turn things around, vows Deila</seg>
<seg id="18">RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic are struggling, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.</seg>
<seg id="19">Defeat to Malmo and subsequent Champions League exit was swiftly followed by losing to 10-man Aberdeen, who now sit five points clear at the top of the table.</seg>
<seg id="20">But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad periods before and we will come again."</seg>
<seg id="21">Now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="22">I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is the same as we are - but we have to go on.</seg>
<seg id="24">We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players much better.</seg>
<seg id="25">To stay together now is so important.</seg>
<seg id="26">Warburton wary of January transfers</seg>
<seg id="27">Despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of a signing spree, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt the Ibrox squad's unity.</seg>
<seg id="28">The ex-Brentford gaffer said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."</seg>
<seg id="29">In terms of players coming in the summer, you have that pre-season period to bed them in, which you've seen with our own group this season.</seg>
<seg id="30">The squad is doing really well.</seg>
<seg id="31">Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.</seg>
<seg id="32">Celtic target Michu in retirement hint</seg>
<seg id="33">Swansea striker Michu, linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has dropped hints that he could retire when his contract with the Swans is up.</seg>
<seg id="34">The 29-year-old has been plagued with a troublesome ankle for two years, and failed to find a move away from Wales in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hearts set for SFA battle over Neilson comments</seg>
<seg id="36">Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was dismissed and went on to lose 3-2, but the defender's red card was later overturned - the third Collum red card in eight months to be rescinded.</seg>
<seg id="37">Neilson is sticking with what he said, insisting: "I didn't question any integrity, I didn't comment on a performance."</seg>
<seg id="38">Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle</seg>
<seg id="39">The diehard Hibee was carpeted after admitting singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.</seg>
<seg id="40">The incident happened in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It was a derby and it was heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "Safe to say I won't be going back to Tynecastle unless it is playing for Celtic."</seg>

<seg id="45">We'll get the boys ready to go again," said Donnelly.</seg>
<seg id="46">McInnes glad to "win ugly" against Hamilton</seg>
<seg id="47">Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to cling on desperately against Hamilton Accies to see out a seventh successive league win that moved them five points clear of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.</seg>
<seg id="48">McInnes said: "There's not a team out there who has won anything, whether it's cups or leagues, who haven't won games like that."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why I'm A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death.</seg>
<seg id="3">If it happens, and I hope it won't, I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation was first made back in January, via his best friend, and though I was shocked, I agreed.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the day approaches, I've come to dread it.</seg>
<seg id="7">So why do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would offer a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">True, journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately.</seg>
<seg id="13">I cannot do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls, and one visit lasting two-and-a-half hours.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the guy.</seg>
<seg id="16">We often laugh a lot when we talk.</seg>
<seg id="17">The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I will just have to try to remember all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here's the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I complained to her.</seg>
<seg id="23">She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but still thinks I'm wrong to do what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip has taken issue with some of the things I've said and written.</seg>
<seg id="25">He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.</seg>
<seg id="26">I've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="28">If he dies, he thinks the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be alongside me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.</seg>
<seg id="31">I won't go over all the details again here.</seg>
<seg id="32">I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being an accessory after the fact.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And it's from this perspective that I will watch him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot claim to be truly objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.</seg>
<seg id="40">What you will get from me is what it's like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Moody alleges stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing</seg>
<seg id="2">Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately.</seg>
<seg id="3">He took aim at stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lidari's positive swab to cobalt, which he can not explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn't want it "to look like sour grapes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once," Moody said.</seg>
<seg id="7">They know it went on.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said.</seg>
<seg id="9">I will go home tonight and sleep well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">When they start to think I'm not that's when I shouldn't be a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would then have to consider what I do with my licence.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earlier, Moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stables to offer information on what I was doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.</seg>
<seg id="15">They obviously believe I'm a cheat.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that's the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they've been incompetent in trying to catch me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Should that make me think it's becoming personal?</seg>
<seg id="19">Has RVL got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry?</seg>
<seg id="20">Am I bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">Am I that bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe people out there think I am.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I've got no doubt what I'm saying now might make them think about that.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I've got to the point now where I don't care and that saddens me.</seg>
<seg id="25">That really saddens me.</seg>
<seg id="26">I will put the pressure on them and onus on them to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trainer's frustration levels have built with the long-running cobalt inquiry involving Lidari and the late scratching had him saying that he could "throw my licence across the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Moody, best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black Caviar, labelled the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice had been applied to the horses legs, which is against the rules.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's against the rules of racing.</seg>
<seg id="31">I've got to accept full responsibility for that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg.</seg>
<seg id="33">It could have had it last night.</seg>
<seg id="34">It could have had it yesterday, which it did have.</seg>
<seg id="35">It had it on race day.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the race day treatment using the poultice, which stewards have opened an inquiry into.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is a joke.</seg>
<seg id="38">People making these rules know nothing about the horse.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his side's tackling as "agenda setting" by the NRL's two premiership favourites.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to "wrestle" his side during the Storm's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm after his side's qualifying final win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called that game a "showcase" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland weren't "too big" into wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended his side's tackling and said they just focused on their "contact" when tackling.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added he took confidence from having two leading coaches criticise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee we haven't changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques, it's just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackles and that has been the turn around for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne is talking about exciting footy.</seg>
<seg id="13">He made a point of comparing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a rat's arse.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting footy, especially his young halves with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made that point in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of footy - not every team has two halves like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.</seg>
<seg id="18">To me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking of us when they get to the big games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet but what was the score? 16-12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game it was 20-18, there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting footy?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting?</seg>
<seg id="24">To me it's agendas.</seg>
<seg id="25">If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night's preliminary final at AAMI Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="2">A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled into Queensland has been granted bail on a $200,000 surety.</seg>
<seg id="3">Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked at Coomera in August.</seg>
<seg id="4">Maksimovic was observed meeting with his co-accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose.</seg>
<seg id="6">Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Maksimovic was a flight risk.</seg>

<seg id="8">He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the crown case he lied to police about where he was staying.</seg>
<seg id="10">Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a surety of $200,000 to secure his release.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Having read the affidavits of both those persons, it is clear that the imposition of a surety of $200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear, he warned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Maksimovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police on a daily basis and adheres to a 6pm-6am curfew.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stevan Hogg used girls phone to lure paedophiles to send images</seg>
<seg id="2">A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit child abuse images.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as she slept then logged into an online messaging service where he had a succession of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.</seg>
<seg id="4">The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hogg's hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">She looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately alerting her mother.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police attended and saw the five pictures, then analysed computers found at the address and discovered "concerning" web searches using terms for finding indecent image of children.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hogg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would "lead paedophiles" on the internet before "pretending he was a police officer to scare them."</seg>
<seg id="8">Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.</seg>
<seg id="9">He accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said he was doing it to lure them in.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying.</seg>
<seg id="14">She saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted.</seg>
<seg id="15">The girl was interviewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making indecent images of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Defence solicitor Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was "no significant sexual element" to his crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentence until October for social work background reports.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases.</seg>

<seg id="1">Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, providing his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">That best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and, given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship is clearly uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre-season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This kind of injury is not career-threatening," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a bone that did not heal well.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is nothing major.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">That might be true from a purely medical perspective but, as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return midseason.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is also an uncomfortable pattern developing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Research by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games during the last five seasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08, they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes, when you are coming back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to get over that.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body stabilises, I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">With Arsenal beginning their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger may also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to keep the balance and give a little breather to players who need it," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most intimidating.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dinamo are also unbeaten in 41 matches after producing their own "Invincible" campaign last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earth tremor that measured 3.2 on the Richter.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger believes that Arsenal have learnt the lesson of last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This drive is immense," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has never been done at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were very close in 2006 but, on the other hand, I am long enough to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship</seg>
<seg id="2">The absence of similar portrayals in shows is glaring, particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever, with suicide rates amongst young males at 15 year high.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in males than females.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a bid to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Male, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students displaying depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of "healthy mood" friends, their chances of recovering doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Equally, for those not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the chances of mental challenges arising.</seg>
<seg id="8">But of course, for friendship to work, it needs to be accessible in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this age of social-media led communication, with its focus on style over substance, immediacy of response is often prioritised over meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality isolation is king.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists term extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply impacts our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">And as a billionaire video-game creator explained recently, money really doesn't buy greater happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each of the characters were not defined by their work, but rather their personalities, which shone through the interaction as friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football on the comfy chairs, and Ross's pining for Rachel, came from the knowledge that yes, men can all relate to this, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."my listening role to people feeling depressed and suicidal has really highlighted how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">Often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old adage of "getting on with it" is strong, as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems."</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term coping mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">It highlighted the little moments of male friendship.</seg>
<seg id="21">As much as my objective, outsider status over the phone helps people in moments of desperation, the long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friend network.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so, if you attend Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, with the sets fully redesigned in celebration, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, better still, if in Starbucks you see someone alone, give a smile and say hello.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what difference your friendship could make.</seg>
<seg id="25">Friends is broadcasting on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest</seg>

<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG ease past Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here's the match report and reaction to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way, but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cavani headed home in the 61st minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while they got the points, it was not a vintage display by Laurent Blanc's side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substituted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illustrious career back in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on," said Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="10">It augurs well.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we did, although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentina winger was labelled as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month, and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Verratti's pass in behind the Malmo defence before angling a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland and into the far corner of the net.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if anyone then expected PSG to romp to a big victory, they were to be disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, lined up with nine full internationals on the field at kick-off and, with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield, were stuffy opponents.</seg>
<seg id="16">But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG let themselves down at times with some wasteful passing and poor finishing, not least from Ibrahimovic, who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cavani just after the restart.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, he proved much more adept when it came to setting up his colleagues, and it was from an Ibrahimovic pass that Di Maria sent in a curling shot which was tipped around the post by Wiland on 52 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan heading home his sixth of the season after Ibrahimovic had flicked on a left-wing cross from Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">That ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game, and only a superb stop by Wiland from point-blank range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed right at the death.</seg>
<seg id="21">Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his side, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The qualifiers are not enough.</seg>
<seg id="24">Hats off to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a magnificent match from them.</seg>

<seg id="1">The second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.</seg>
<seg id="2">From September 17-18, the second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, in which the Tyumen delegation, headed by the governor, will take part.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen, Vladimir Shuglya, who is included in the official delegation, spoke about the upcoming event and the interim results of cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vladimir Fedorovich, what objectives does the Sochi forum set?</seg>
<seg id="5">This major event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is built on the effective cooperation of the regions, and important links between the two states.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's planned that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, will attend the plenary session.</seg>
<seg id="8">During the plenary and breakout sessions, the conversation will be about the experiences of regional and municipal authorities in Russia and Belarus with the implementation of industrial policy, the regulatory and statutory framework, and the programmes of the Union State.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Governor of Tyumen region will speak at the forum.</seg>
<seg id="10">I think that this is evidence of the successful and sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="11">The forum will also be attended by representatives from relevant ministries and agencies, as well as by Russian and Belarusian businesspeople.</seg>
<seg id="12">There will also be trade shows and specialised exhibitions, including those from Tyumen region.</seg>
<seg id="13">I hope that the forum will help us sign profitable new contracts and agreements.</seg>
<seg id="14">I'll add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk in June of last year.</seg>
<seg id="15">More that two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, took part in the event.</seg>
<seg id="16">At that time, a very important cooperation agreement was signed between Tyumen and Minsk regions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The significance of the work we have accomplished is evidenced by the fact that a meeting of the standing seminar of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Furthermore, a delegation from Tyumen region's agricultural sector visited the Republic of Belarus in order to study the experience of Belarusians with training staff in agriculture, identify additional areas of mutual interest, and organise new investment projects in the agricultural sector.</seg>
<seg id="19">You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.</seg>
<seg id="20">What issues did you discuss?</seg>
<seg id="21">During the meeting with the Governor of Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakushev, the conversation was about cooperation between the region and the Republic of Belarus in today's challenging environment.</seg>
<seg id="22">The issue of supplying Belarusian agricultural equipment and using financial mechanisms - they are needed to reduce the cost of machinery for the end-consumer - were also touched on.</seg>
<seg id="23">Issues associated with the work of the Tyumen trading house, Belshina, and options for loss prevention, were discussed.</seg>
<seg id="24">These are important issues, since investment projects need to work well and generate profit for the region.</seg>
<seg id="25">The continued delivery of JSC MAZ passenger trucks and development of the JSC MAZ service centre, which was established in Tyumen at the JSC TPATP facility, were also talked about.</seg>
<seg id="26">The conversation also concerned preparations for the visit of a working group from the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of the current year.</seg>
<seg id="27">Another topic of discussion was the completion of negotiations and the signing of an agreement on trade-economic, scientific-technological, and cultural cooperation between Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="28">As such, the dynamic of our mutual relationship promises to reach a new level.</seg>
<seg id="29">These issues also concerned the regional centre.</seg>
<seg id="30">During the meeting with the Head of the Administration of Tyumen city, Aleksandr Moor, we talked about upgrading the Tyumen bus fleet.</seg>
<seg id="31">Approximately 100 buses are already "at death's door", and, as such, a new set of vehicles from Belarus is needed, which will operate on clean gas fuel.</seg>
<seg id="32">Yet another aspect: the Tyumen elevator factory is working with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products, JSC Mogilevliftmash, by procuring components from them.</seg>
<seg id="33">In my opinion, these activities could become even more developed, given the programme to install new elevators in the regional centre.</seg>
<seg id="34">I'll add that a meeting was held with the Governor of Kurgansk region, as part of the expanded powers of the consul, during which the issue of increasing the turnover of trade and the delivery of modern Belarusian equipment to the Trans-Ural region was discussed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A meeting with the Governor of Omsk region is planned for the end of September.</seg>
<seg id="36">The expanded consular district contains five federal subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called the original headquarters of the district.</seg>
<seg id="37">The region is a testing ground for the launch of many promising projects, including the work of the honorary consul general.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the whole, these types of meetings are important and worthwhile because they make it possible to directly and quickly resolve many issues, while removing their contentiousness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the current environment, it's critically important to not undermine groundwork while continuing to develop future possibilities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn't needed behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="3">During Sunday night's episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen screenplay.</seg>
<seg id="4">"When we're talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show," Damon asserted.</seg>
<seg id="5">Shocked, Brown reacted with offended disbelief, letting out "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as The Martian actor's comments settled in the air.</seg>
<seg id="6">Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown initially said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The only black character who's a hooker who gets hit by her white pimp.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Dear White People producer pushed for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted their directing could "end up giving us something we don't want."</seg>
<seg id="10">After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval over Damon's comments.</seg>
<seg id="11">Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger toward the clip writing, "Matt Damon speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is SO WHITE it hurts."</seg>
<seg id="12">The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since being posted.</seg>
<seg id="13">Damon's comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion.</seg>
<seg id="14">After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took nationwide effect, urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color.</seg>
<seg id="15">In February, singer Prince alluded to the movement while introducing the nominees of Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Albums still matter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Like books and black lives, albums still matter.</seg>
<seg id="18">More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question of whether the group should be considered a hate group.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," leaders said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Damon was recently announced as one of a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's portrayal in the West.</seg>
<seg id="21">Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear.</seg>

<seg id="2">Pro-rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win American Ninja Warrior Monday night taking home the $1 million grand prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">The competition show, which just wrapped up its 7th season, has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="5">The final task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="6">Britten went first completing the challenge on time, making him the first-ever athlete to complete American Ninja Warrior's grueling stage 4, however, Caldiero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner.</seg>
<seg id="7">Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-fought victory, still in shock about winning the $1 million grand prize.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I mean it's amazing to think about, like I've never made or lived off more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! of his serious pay-bump.</seg>
<seg id="9">So to all of a sudden...like I can't even imagine what it's going to be like...the future is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="10">Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why, despite Britten being the first ever competitor to finish the course, won't be awarded any prize money.</seg>
<seg id="11">By the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If there's more than one finisher, the one with the fastest time gets it," said Weed.</seg>
<seg id="13">As much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing, he does get the great gratification.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think he harbors any ill will about it.</seg>
<seg id="15">He's just so happy to have done what he's done.</seg>
<seg id="16">He's received tons of accolades from fans.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's such a great guy, and a family man.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's a hero to his kids and his wife.</seg>
<seg id="19">Geoff said to me, "If I was going to be beat by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."</seg>
<seg id="20">And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed.</seg>
<seg id="21">America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in Spring 2016.</seg>

<seg id="1">Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins</seg>
<seg id="2">MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.</seg>
<seg id="4">Reducing to being a spoiler, the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Twins squandered a chance to climb to within one-half game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that has been so elusive over much of the season's second half.</seg>
<seg id="7">"All wins are fun, no matter how it happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon made his early offensive support hold up, as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then tacked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was only his third quality start in his past nine outings.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I just want to finish strong this year," Simon said.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's hard for the bullpen to throw every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.</seg>
<seg id="13">Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.</seg>
<seg id="16">He looked good in (batting practice), looked noticeably better in BP, and he carried it right into the game.</seg>
<seg id="17">Trailing by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.</seg>
<seg id="18">Center fielder Byron Buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line.</seg>
<seg id="19">Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt single, and Simon got second baseman Brian Dozier to strike out swinging before being lifted for left-hander Blaine Hardy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Hardy walked Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel Sano, who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew VerHagen.</seg>
<seg id="21">With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was the major-league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit into a DP.</seg>
<seg id="23">After Detroit tacked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth, Mauer ripped an RBI double to the gap against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.</seg>
<seg id="25">Detroit took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes in the early going.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Obviously not the start I'd like to have," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."</seg>
<seg id="28">After getting the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.</seg>
<seg id="29">A two-out walk to right fielder J.D. Martinez brought up Victor Martinez, who singled up the middle for the first run of the game.</seg>
<seg id="30">Victor Martinez snapped his 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring position.</seg>
<seg id="31">Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third, ending the threat.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Tigers added on in the second, getting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="33">"That was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.</seg>
<seg id="34">He didn't hit it particularly well, but he got it in the right spot.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hughes, who was on a pitch count, pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.</seg>
<seg id="37">NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="38">He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on Sanchez's shoulder back in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="39">Sanchez, on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid-August, was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start.</seg>
<seg id="40">With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Norris will come off the DL to start against the Twins.</seg>
<seg id="41">Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for LHP David Price on July 30.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right oblique.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="44">Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will oppose Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).</seg>

<seg id="2">The original appeal by the Presidential Representative for Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, against the decision to recognise the book, "A Prayer to God: It's meaning and place in Islam", as "extremist material", has been received by the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Court, Interfax reports, with reference to the chairperson of the city court, Aleksandr Chukhrai.</seg>
<seg id="3">The court is now waiting for possible objections from parties to the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chukhrai declined to comment on statements by several deputies from the Russian State Duma about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence agencies and ISIS.</seg>

<seg id="6">On September 11, the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the decision by Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognise the book as "extremist material".</seg>
<seg id="7">An appeal from the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Prosecutor's Office was received Friday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to only recognise the opinion of the author of the book as extremist and not the verses from the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is the opinion of the prosecutor's office that the judge made the wrong ruling", Chukhrai stated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The decision to recognise the book as "extremist material" was made on August 12, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="11">Specifically, the following quotes from the Koran were dubbed "extremist": "We worship You and we pray to You for help" and "Do not invoke anyone along with Allah".</seg>
<seg id="12">Kadyrov has called those who made the ruling about the book "devils and provocateurs".</seg>
<seg id="13">He has requested State Duma deputies to legislatively ban the court's decision concerning the texts from the holy book.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should adopt a law that would ban court rulings related to texts from the Koran and other Divine Scriptures", Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram account.</seg>

<seg id="7">According to Heiko Maas, it is expected that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notices explaining the reason for the deletion of their entries.</seg>

<seg id="9">Facebook's management intends to provide them with the required financial support.</seg>
<seg id="10">The decision to delete posts containing negative remarks about migrants and refugees was made by the social network's management and Germany's Ministry of Justice following a significant rise in xenophobic attitudes on the German section of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the most obvious reasons for this has been the migration crisis, unprecedented in size, gripping the countries of the European Union recently.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxation areas will appear at Moscow cemeteries.</seg>
<seg id="2">In the near future, several cemeteries in the capital will be equipped with special areas for relaxation and psychological rest.</seg>
<seg id="3">The first of them will be Butovskoye, Domodedovskoye, and Shcherbinskoye cemeteries.</seg>
<seg id="4">The very first area for psychological rest has already appeared at Troyekurovskoye cemetery in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the future, similar areas will appear in other districts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="6">Artem Ekimov, who holds the post of head of the state-funded institution (SFI), Ritual, spoke to m24.ru portal about this.</seg>
<seg id="7">The relaxation areas will look like small green spaces, reminiscent of parks.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to specialists, cemetery visitors will be able to relax in these "corners", be alone with their thoughts, and gather psychological strength.</seg>
<seg id="9">Soon, relaxation areas will be built at Domodedovskoye, Butovskoye, and Shcherbinskoye cemeteries, and then in other districts of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the head of the SFI, Ritual, in the event an expansion of the cemetery's area is required, builders will try to preserve existing wooded areas to the greatest extent possible.</seg>
<seg id="11">Greenery will serve as a living fence that will separate the relaxation areas and the territory just outside that is designated for burial.</seg>
<seg id="12">SFI Ritual's experts also stated their intention to submit a proposal to ban fences at gravesites.</seg>
<seg id="13">New cemeteries really could become barrier-free.</seg>
<seg id="14">Furthermore, SFI Ritual spoke about a readiness to engage in installing electronic terminals that cemetery visitors could use to help figure out the GPS coordinates and plate numbers of gravesites.</seg>
<seg id="15">In June of this year, SFI Ritual also proposed adjusting the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, digging a grave in the summertime will cost one thousand roubles less than in the winter weeks when the ground is frozen.</seg>
<seg id="17">It bears noting that, over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have increased by an average of 10 percent.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lost mushroom picker is found in Elninsky woods after five days.</seg>
<seg id="2">The elderly man turned out to be alive even though he had spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without provisions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The poor mushroom picker was found thanks to the joint efforts of rescue workers and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Aleksandr Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from Tambov region spent five days in the woods."</seg>
<seg id="5">Without food or water.</seg>
<seg id="6">Relatives, rescue workers, and volunteers were searching for him.</seg>
<seg id="7">There were even cynologists with dogs, but to no avail.</seg>
<seg id="8">The man was only found after a helicopter joined the search efforts.</seg>
<seg id="9">On that day, Vitaly Aleksandrovich went out into the woods, as per usual, to collect honey fungus and birch boletus mushrooms, but he hadn't returned by the evening.</seg>
<seg id="10">Relatives immediately called for help and, already on the next day, rescue workers and concerned residents from the neighbouring village started searching: there were approximately 30 people in total.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the fifth day, a helicopter from the fire-rescue centre joined them.</seg>
<seg id="12">Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue group section of the Smolensk Region Fire and Rescue Centre, said: "The helicopter was brought in and the man was found".</seg>
<seg id="13">He had walked very far away, into a totally different area.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was around 12 km from the search area.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travelled a huge distance for his age.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's a miracle he's still alive.</seg>
<seg id="17">The mushroom picker was admitted to Elninsky Central District Hospital unconscious and in critical condition.</seg>
<seg id="18">Paramedics diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as with severe dehydration and hypothermia.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors can't fathom how the elderly man could still be alive after spending five days in the woods.</seg>
<seg id="20">Valentina Nepsha, Head of the medical ward at Elninsky Central District Hospital: "An examination of the patient has been completed and treatment has been determined".</seg>
<seg id="21">Intravenous and antibacterial treatments.</seg>
<seg id="22">While taking into account all of his chronic illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="23">The patient's condition improved in the morning, and it remains critical, but with positive tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="24">The pensioner, Vitaly Aleksandrovich, comes to Smolenshchina from Tambov region every year.</seg>
<seg id="25">His grandson says that his grandfather had gone collecting mushrooms before, but he had never gone deep into the woods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Aleksei Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom picker, shared the following: "The woods aren't far from the road; he's not really a local himself."</seg>
<seg id="27">He's just been coming to visit for a few years now, to visit relatives.</seg>
<seg id="28">And well, he went out to collect mushrooms.</seg>
<seg id="29">Obviously, he went a little too far and got lost.</seg>
<seg id="30">With the beginning of mushroom-picking season, people frequently get lost in all districts of Smolensk region.</seg>
<seg id="31">Over just the past several days, there have been five similar cases.</seg>
<seg id="32">Rescue workers offer this reminder: you must go out into the woods in bright clothing, with a small supply of food, matches, and a compass.</seg>
<seg id="33">Furthermore, it's advisable to leave a trail behind you, so that later on it's possible to find your way back.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vesti Economy - Nobel Laureate: Globalisation</seg>
<seg id="2">Printing the Processes of Globalisation should have helped to reduce inequality in the world.</seg>
<seg id="3">In practice, the situation looks entirely different; the income gap in developing economies is, on the contrary, growing.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eric Maksin.</seg>
<seg id="5">To correct this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, says Chief Research Fellow at the International Laboratory of Decision Choice and Analysis at the National Research University, Higher School of Economics (NRU HSE), and 2007 Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics, Eric Maksin.</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trade borders between countries have become increasingly more open.</seg>
<seg id="8">Proponents of globalisation predicted great benefits for developing economies.</seg>
<seg id="9">"And these predictions have to a great extent come true", Maksin underscores.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, for example, China and India achieved significant GDP per capita growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, not everything is so rosy.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was expected that globalisation would narrow the gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots" in poor countries, which presents itself in the form of income inequality, or, to be more exact, wages.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, in reality, this inequality only became more pronounced, Eric Maksin points out in his article "Why global markets haven't reduced inequality in developing economies", which was published in The World Bank Economic Review, and was translated and quoted by the NRI HSE.</seg>
<seg id="14">Eric Maksin, in cooperation with the economist and professor from Harvard University, Michael Kremer, developed an alternative theory, which demonstrates why income inequality increases in poor countries in proportion to the growth of globalisation, NRI HSE recalls.</seg>
<seg id="15">Specific processes are at play in the new global market.</seg>
<seg id="16">In order to demonstrate them, Maksin distinguishes four skill levels for specialists: A and B for wealthy countries, and C and D for poor ones.</seg>
<seg id="17">After globalisation, the D specialists from poor countries don't have the required skill level to cooperate with specialists A and B from wealthy countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">And while the wages of C level workers from poor countries rise thanks to cooperation with B colleagues from wealthy ones, D workers either don't experience the same effect or their salaries totally plunge.</seg>
<seg id="19">The resulting effect is that the internationalisation of production will lead to an increase in the wage gap between these two categories of specialists in poor countries and, consequently, increased levels of inequality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kremer and E. Maksin have proposed a remarkably beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.</seg>
<seg id="21">It makes it possible to explain why globalisation has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, tenured professor, Head of the International Laboratory of Decision Choice and Analysis, and Head of the Department of Mathematics at NRI HSE.</seg>
<seg id="22">And, like any powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to an upsurge of empirical work in this field.</seg>
<seg id="23">The solution to the problem, in Eric Maksin's opinion, is to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, the workers themselves, the academic notes, don't have the money for this, and it's not profitable for companies to pay for their training.</seg>
<seg id="25">In a situation like this, governments, international agencies, NGOs, and private foundations can play a significant role, Maksin believes.</seg>
<seg id="26">The academic notes that the developed theory in no way calls for an end to the process of globalisation, which has brought and will bring benefits in the form of GDP growth of countries.</seg>

<seg id="1">Derbent: a living link with time.</seg>
<seg id="2">Derbent is one of the most ancient cities in Russia; in September, it celebrates its 2000th anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="3">The programme of celebratory events includes: a festival of the ethnic cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of times past; an exhibition of Derbent carpets and an open-house day at places of worship; a historical-musical show, "2000 years in one hour", and tours of the renovated Peter I Museum.</seg>
<seg id="4">The medieval stone Naryn-Kala fortress, old Arabic inscriptions on walls, narrow streets, and palace gardens: all of it appears as if from the pages of "One thousand and one nights".</seg>
<seg id="5">Derbent is the only Russian city that has survived in the same place since antiquity.</seg>
<seg id="6">Even though it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Khaganate, and the Golden Horde.</seg>
<seg id="7">The age of the oriental planes that grow in the courtyard of Derbent's Juma mosque equals several centuries.</seg>
<seg id="8">These massive plants are protected under the All-Russia "Trees are the monuments of living nature" programme.</seg>
<seg id="9">The shade of the spreading crown saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.</seg>
<seg id="10">A visitor to the mosque is poured aromatic tea and offered Dagestani delicacies: honey fig, persimmon, medlar, miracle flatbread, ayran, and sweets.</seg>
<seg id="11">Large samovars have been used in Derbent since the dawn of time so that tea can be served to many guests at one time.</seg>
<seg id="12">The inscription at the entrance to the Juma mosque says that the building was constructed in the 115th year of the Hijra.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is, in the year 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is the most ancient mosque in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="15">The interior dazzles in terms of scale and solemnity: the arcades of domes and arches rest on square columns and are lit by sunlight streaming through miniature windows.</seg>
<seg id="16">Keeping and breeding doves is a traditional pastime for residents of Derbent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Owners of these domesticated birds place dovecotes in courtyards, under trees, and in attics.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's a spectacular sight to see a flock of white doves take off into the sky, looking like a flash of festive fireworks.</seg>
<seg id="19">In order to defend against the ancient Persian enemies, the Caspian gates were blocked off by twin stone walls.</seg>
<seg id="20">Jutting out 500 metres into the sea, this construction enclosed Derbent's harbour.</seg>
<seg id="21">In 2003, Derbent's fortress walls were included on UNESCO's world heritage list as the best-preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.</seg>
<seg id="22">Carpets were woven in Derbent as far back as in the fifth century, and the technique for this unique craft has remained almost unchanged up to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="23">Carpets to suit every taste are sold on one of the streets adjacent to the city market: carpets woven from wool, cotton, or felt, in every colour and shade, with long or short pile and complex designs and whimsical fringe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Construction of the city began with magals: neighbourhoods of single-story stone buildings.</seg>
<seg id="25">For many years, the magals remained virtually unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="26">Only the satellite dishes, air conditioners on the walls, and streetlights serve as reminders that you are in a modern and not a medieval city.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the old part of the city, parts of the aqueduct, built by the Persians approximately a thousand years ago, are preserved.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ancient springs, from which local residents still collect water, survive to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many residents of Derbent prefer the water from the trusted historical fountains to regular tap water.</seg>
<seg id="30">Derbent was one of the centres of the pottery trade.</seg>
<seg id="31">Glazed and painted vases, dishes, pitchers, and cups were prized throughout the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even today, potters' hands produce marvellous ceramic works for both everyday use and as souvenirs.</seg>
<seg id="33">During holiday and festival days, crowds of spectators gather under a tightrope, where students from the Republican School of Circus Arts perform.</seg>
<seg id="34">The history of this amazing and risky artform dates back several centuries.</seg>
<seg id="35">A new trend is seeing increasingly more girls amongst the tightrope walkers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Today, the Museum of Culture and Everyday Life of Ancient Derbent operates at the location of the former Maiden's Bathhouse.</seg>
<seg id="37">Previously, this is where unmarried and betrothed young women would wash themselves in the company of their girlfriends, but now, anyone who wants to can see the vaulted domed hall, hot and cold pools, and bathing tools from times past.</seg>
<seg id="38">The majority of Derbent's homes have hot water, but bathhouses and steam rooms are just as popular today as they were in the old days.</seg>
<seg id="39">The benefit of warming the body with steam was written about in ancient books.</seg>
<seg id="40">After using the bathhouse, the blood is improved, the muscles no longer feel tired, and the body gains flexibility and a sense of lightness.</seg>
<seg id="41">Ethnic households from many areas of Dagestan participate in the Fellowship Festival, which is held at the Naryn-Kala fortress.</seg>
<seg id="42">Participants in ethnic costumes dance, play folk music, perform songs of the peoples of the Caucasus, and treat visitors to delicious homemade cheese.</seg>
<seg id="43">Kyrkhlyar is the burial site of forty martyrs who laid down their lives for Islam.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is one of the most revered sites for Muslims in the North Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="45">The sarcophagi, yellowed by time and carved from solid stone blocks, are oriented on a west-east axis, as is the Arab custom.</seg>
<seg id="46">Brothers, Gavril and Albert Yakubov, cut hair and shave clients in a small shop near the Upper Bazaar.</seg>
<seg id="47">The barbershop has been operating at this site for many years.</seg>
<seg id="48">The tricks of the barber trade are passed down from generation to generation.</seg>
<seg id="49">Moreover, the Yakubov brothers can do not only traditional, but also the most modern hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="50">On one of the streets of the Old City, a house where exiled Decembrist writer, Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, lived, has been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="51">Having learned Turkish and collected ethnographic materials, he described Derbent in the first third of the 19th century, with its ancient monuments and the everyday life of its citizens.</seg>
<seg id="52">The teahouse is a traditional meeting place in the East, where only tea and home-baked goods are served.</seg>
<seg id="53">Men come here to quench their thirst, converse with friends, and resolve business issues.</seg>
<seg id="54">As in the past, it is not recommended that women cross the threshold of a teahouse.</seg>
<seg id="55">Derbent's dance troupe, Caspian, was founded three years ago, but it has already managed to participate in events at the republican and national level.</seg>
<seg id="56">The troupe's principal performers rehearse every day, perfecting Avar, Dargin, Tat, and Armenian folk dances.</seg>
<seg id="57">At nightfall, when the noise fades away and the streetlights come on, local residents settle onto benches outside of their homes with protruding terraces.</seg>
<seg id="58">Usually, Derbent residents discuss everyday issues.</seg>
<seg id="59">But in the lead-up to the anniversary, they increasingly recall episodes from the unique history of their city, which has influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea and Caspian region.</seg>

<seg id="1">A business "game in the airport" takes place at Domodedovo.</seg>
<seg id="2">A new form of training is being tested in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four hundred students tried their hand at being airport staff.</seg>
<seg id="4">To accomplish this, three airport models were built at Domodedovo.</seg>
<seg id="5">The young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also maintained the airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="6">All of this was in the form of a business simulation game, however, in terms of difficulty, it was on par with real life.</seg>
<seg id="7">Delayed flights, two passengers with broken bones on-board at the same time, and a gangway that got lost somewhere on the way to the airplane.</seg>
<seg id="8">For a real airport this would be hell.</seg>
<seg id="9">But for those set up in the hangar at Domodedovo, it was just a standard set of tasks that the rookies needed to address.</seg>
<seg id="10">Three large airports from different countries of the world were contained in just one hangar.</seg>
<seg id="11">Four hundred students from colleges and universities in the capital are working inside of it today.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's an unprecedented chance to learn everything about the inner workings of an airport.</seg>
<seg id="13">The registration of passengers, maintenance of airplanes, handling of baggage - they were even entrusted with operating the buses on the tarmac, the gangways, and the inspection of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="14">And passengers are full of problems.</seg>
<seg id="15">One has an issue with their documents, another missed their flight, and a third filled their bag with suspicious items.</seg>
<seg id="16">And all of this must be dealt with, as in real life, within the shortest time frame.</seg>
<seg id="17">For each of these completed tasks, they are given a certain amount of virtual money, as if the airline company were paying them a given amount for servicing the flight.</seg>
<seg id="18">"For failing to complete given tasks, they were penalised with a fine", explains the game's financial analyst, Dmitry Khilko, in an interview with the programme Vesti-Moskva.</seg>
<seg id="19">Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely watching these events.</seg>
<seg id="20">For them, this test is an effort to try out a new type of training.</seg>
<seg id="21">They've already found a place for it in a secondary vocational education course.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Six interregional centres of excellence will be created, which, essentially, will become the new business models for modern colleges, with an up-to-date management system, highly-qualified staff, and the latest equipment", says Natalya Zolotareva, Director of the Department of State Policy in the area of labour force training and continuing professional education at the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although, the students aren't really concerned about grand plans.</seg>
<seg id="24">After three days of such training, it looks like they are in need of a day off.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the plus side, the marks for this exam were expressed in entirely material terms.</seg>
<seg id="26">The very latest smart glasses, better than anything else I've ever seen!</seg>
<seg id="27">"I got them for responding in a timely manner to complaints about our airport on Instagram", said a satisfied game participant, PR Manager for the "Frankfurt Airport" team, Sergei Shuvalov.</seg>
<seg id="28">The judges took note, so to speak, of the very best, in order to offer them jobs at the end of the training.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Green Tribunal turns out to be quick to judge.</seg>
<seg id="2">A typical situation: four officials stand in front of Judge Swatanter Kumar's bench while listening to his complaints about work done.</seg>
<seg id="3">The court is entirely unsatisfied with the quality of your work.</seg>
<seg id="4">We didn't provide you with a 110-page order for you to make a mockery of it, says Kumar.</seg>
<seg id="5">If even just one more brick is put up, we will order that every existing building site be demolished.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NGT), a judicial authority established in 2010, in order to stop the rapid pollution of the environment that has accompanied the explosive economic growth of the past decades.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since that time, the Tribunal has managed to hear more than 10 thousand cases related to air pollution, waste collection, geological developments, hazardous waste, and the construction of dikes.</seg>
<seg id="8">In two out of three cases, the court rules to halt construction that is causing pollution.</seg>
<seg id="9">The stakes are unbelievable high: in the not quite 60 years that have passed since the declaration of independence, intensified industrial development has turned India from a country of unadulterated jungles into one of the most over-populated and polluted countries in the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">The problem is especially acute in large metropolitan areas where the development of infrastructure is lagging behind rapid urbanisation: cities are blanketed by thick smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and industrial and household waste, and the few remaining residential areas are being razed to build new residential neighbourhoods.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the government's formal support of the green movement, the NGT is regularly criticised by Narendra Modi's government, since it is frequently the main cause for the cancellation of large investment projects.</seg>
<seg id="12">For example, in May of this year, the Minister of the Environment called the courts rulings "extreme" and "unenforceable".</seg>
<seg id="13">Sometimes the court's decisions really are impossible to carry out within the judicially set timeframe, confirms Raj Panjwani, an environmental lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, impossible deadlines have an upside: at least they force the responsible parties to get cracking.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Its main purpose is to shake up this system", the lawyer adds.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Green Tribunal has already cancelled major projects on several occasions: construction of an airport, an electrical power station, and hundreds of other smaller facilities has been terminated on its account.</seg>
<seg id="17">Furthermore, they also try not to forget about the people: for example, during deliberation on the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telangana that had polluted the local river with fluoride.</seg>
<seg id="18">We could shutdown your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.</seg>
<seg id="19">"People will lose their jobs", Kumar commented on his ruling.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, similar explanations are by no means always met with understanding from ordinary people, whose lives could be changed by one stroke of the judicial pen.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, in April, the Tribunal issued a ruling to ban transport vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital, which caused a nation-wide outcry.</seg>
<seg id="22">In spite of a steep decline in popularity and a barrage of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to reverse the ruling.</seg>
<seg id="23">Instead, he requested statistics on inbound and outbound vehicular traffic from the Delhi government, and also submitted a proposal to purchase 10 thousand additional buses, after having checked in advance with the factories whether or not they were capable of filling such an order.</seg>
<seg id="24">As sources of pollution like landfills, fuel quality, and even road incidents started to fall into the purview of the court, the people's wrath began to gradually dissipate.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the most painful subject for the principled judge became the clean-up programme for the Ganges River, which was announced to great fanfare by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.</seg>
<seg id="26">When talking about the Ganges, a river that is sacred to Hindus, the judge is often unable to restrain his emotions and will switch to shouting.</seg>
<seg id="27">Do you know what the word "sacred" means?</seg>
<seg id="28">Someone poured water from the Ganges onto a statue of a god and it ended up covered in faecal matter, the judge states angrily.</seg>
<seg id="29">You continue to pollute the river because you think: the Ganges is the Ganges and it washes away all of our sins.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the river that we worship, but just look at what you do to it every day.</seg>
<seg id="31">The clean up of the Ganges is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.</seg>
<seg id="32">Currently, the level of faecal bacteria in the river exceeds acceptable norms by more than 120 times.</seg>
<seg id="33">Every year, anywhere between 1.5 and 3 million of the 700 million Hindus that bathe in it die from infectious diseases.</seg>

<seg id="2">The economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise, and improve opening-up policies," he said, addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.</seg>
<seg id="4">Promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vitality, and provide new room for economic growth, Xi said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access, relaxation of border-control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and overhauling the resident registration system.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the statement, a negative list, identifying sectors and businesses that are off-limits for investment, will be drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="7">The system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies, making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a bid to open up state-controlled sectors, more areas will be open to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment, and will protect the lawful interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits, or "green card," by optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process.</seg>
<seg id="14">Guaranteeing lawyers' right to practice and nurturing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="15">The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.</seg>
