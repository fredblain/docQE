Refugees need accommodation: study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense
And more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay.
Pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The struggle for allocations in the German housing market began long ago.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are crowding into a market which in many large towns is already overburdened.
They are competing with residents on low incomes for the last affordable homes.
To supply the demand for affordable homes, 400,000 new units must be built every year up to 2020.
This is the conclusion reached by a study commissioned by the "Social Housing" federation of associations.
In comparison, 260,000 units were completed in this year in Germany.
This amounts to a shortfall of 140,000 homes.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in initial reception accommodation.
Many then push onto the housing market and stand in long queues in front of rental flats.
According to the German Federal Statistical Office, however, in the last year fewer than half of all asylum seekers have lived as tenants.
The negative development in the housing market, however, is not just due to the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study points to significant failings in housing policy over the last year.
Germany has a housing deficit which increases every year.
There is a current shortfall in urban areas of around 770,000 living units laments Matthias Günther, author of the study.
This is why many professionals in large towns are forced to live in flat shares.
Due to the slump in the housing market, young adults of necessity live longer in "Hotel Mama".
In large towns over the last few years, the number of square metres per head has decreased for the first time.
In order to solve the problem, the "Social Housing" alliance suggests a fresh start.
New incentives should revive social housing.
For example land transfer tax could be waived and the land tax for sponsored housing temporarily suspended.
In addition, according to the association, attractive tax depreciation possibilities are necessary.
The KfW state bank's refugee funding programme has already been well received in towns and local authorities.
On Monday evening, a good week after start of the programme, €184 million – more than half of the around €300 million which had been made available – had already been requested.
The project may now even be stepped up.
