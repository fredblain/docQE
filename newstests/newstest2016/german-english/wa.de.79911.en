Talented artist invests three years in his personal interpretation of the Bible.
Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written an introduction and updated the text of the Bible.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not in the Otmar Alt Bible, which has now been issued with magnificent pictures.
For Otmar Alt, who has devised his own personal interpretation of biblical stories in 150 motifs on paper and canvas, in the beginning was the picture.
The 75-year-old conceived his "language" with bright colours and imaginative forms - which are however by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: depending on the respective themes, they can appear to be thoroughly gloomy.
Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project for around three years and for this project he made a subjective choice from an artistic perspective from the many subject areas in the "Book of books".
Cycles evolved, dedicated to topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, the Commandments or the Lord's Prayer.
Without even approaching them, he immediately attacted multiple partners: this applies to the Luther Verlag, a publisher specialising in theological works as well as the Kettler Verlag, who focus on publishing art books.
And in particular author Klaus Altepost, who has grappled with the particular Bible passages based on the paintings.
He has interpreted the Bible texts selected by Otmar Alt and "translated" them to the current day, in a topical context.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's paintings.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotations of Martin Luther and each composition by the artist, who has here formulated his own personal concepts for the respective situations.
The decorated cover of the book is lettered in gold.
The 75-year-old allows at the same time a twofold insight, deep into both his soul and his emotions.
This is particularly intimate.
Ultimately, his emotions were the key trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, who was born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herrnhut order.
"Education there took place under the shadow of the cane", remembers Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to process this, so that perhaps I can come to terms with the Lord again.
His second point is that he wants to help art once more to take a more significant place in this fast moving age: "The perception of the visual world today is shaped by advertising, which is loud.
Symbolism has been driven out.
Artists have a different passion and joy in presenting things.
Pictures always have something mysterious about them; they are not decoration.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants his viewers to let themselves "fall into" the pictures, to let them leave their impression, to discover and experience the power they have: "The picture is looking for its counterpart".
At the launch of the Otmar Alt Bible on Tuesday, Klaus Altepost confessed to having "always" been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like the way he sees life with his pictures".
Alt was not interested in recording the whole of the Bible, selecting only the the themes which were for him the most significant and also the most mysterious.
"This wasn't a collaboration between partners," says Altepost, "it was about the pictures; the text is merely an explanation." The result is a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler of the Luther Verlag this work is an invitation "to add depth to his life and to find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak, for Möhler, the (biblical) language of love as well as that of responsibility.
Some of the originals - paper and canvas - will be shown for the first time in an exhibition which opens on 15th November in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
