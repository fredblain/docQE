The chassis makes the difference: every two years car manufacturers present their new models at the IAA
In 2015 movement can be noticed in particular in compact cars, which are selling especially well at the moment.
Compact class cars are currently very much in demand: according to the Federal Office for Motor Transport (KBA) about 28.1 percent of new registrations in August alone belonged to this segment.
This is also reflected at the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
In among all the futuristic concept vehicles and the new high-end and luxury models, this year above all it is new compact models which are being introduced.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car sector here is the Opel Astra, which hits the car dealerships in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel boss Karl-Thomas Neumann at the show.
It is at the heart of the brand.
To ensure that it sells well, the price of the new Astra is not increasing significantly.
Opel proposes an entry point below that of its main competitor, the VW Golf, which starts at €17,650.
The latest Astra costs from €16,990.
With a new 1.4 litre engine, the Astra has an output of 74 kw/100 hp.
The Hessian manufacturer also offers diesel and petrol engines from 70 kw/95 hp to 147 kw/200 hp, including the first three cylinder petrol model.
Unlike its most important competitors, VW Golf and Ford Focus, for the first time the Opel Astra is only available as a five door.
In spring the estate car, already seen at the IAA, will follow as the second option
And what other compact cars are being introduced alongside the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault introduces the fourth generation of its competitor to the Astra, the Mégane, into the race.
The Mégane can be seen at the show exclusively as a five-door, in a conventional and a distinctly sporty version.
It will be available in dealerships at the beginning of next year, then also as an estate model.
Infiniti: the Infiniti Q30 is brand new in this segment.
The Nissan offshoot is looking to find its place in the rapidly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti, with its curved lines, fits right into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will have a petrol engine with a performance of at least 90 kw/122 hp.
A diesel with 80 kw/109 hp or 125 kw/170 hp is also on offer.
Suzuki Baleno: also new in the segment is the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
On offer is the petrol engine model, including a newly developed 1.0 litre turbo engine and a performance of 82 kw/111 hp.
According to the manfacturer's specifications, the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
The Baleno is launched in Europe in early 2016.
DS4: not totally new, but completely redesigned, is the DS 4 compact car model, which can be seen at the IAA.
The designers at the classy Citroën offshoot have turned their hand primarily to the front end: here the radiator grille has been newly designed and the modified headlights have been equipped with LED technology.
In the interior the infotainment system in particular has been modernised, the number of buttons on the touch screen has been reduced and for the first time Apple's CarPlay has been incorporated.
In the compact class the IAA also features a string of revised and new versions such as the updated Mercedes A Class or the Peugeot 308.
