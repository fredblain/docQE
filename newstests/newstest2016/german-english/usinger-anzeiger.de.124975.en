Austria running checks on southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has once more introduced checks to its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Interior Minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, stated on the Austrian television channel ORF on Tuesday evening that currently nobody is being sent back to Hungary.
Nor has Germany sent any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that is the agreement," she confirmed.
On the question of an agreement about whether a specific number of refugees per day can be taken to go to Germany from Austria, Mikl-Leitner said that discussions on this matter have already been held between the general director for public security and representatives of Germany.
She gave no specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
Over the last few days tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria from Hungary over the so-called Balkan route.
Most of them are heading to Germany.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague, Werner Faymann, together with a number of other EU states and heads of government, are proposing a special summit for next week.
On Sunday Germany started to impose temporary border controls.
To date the EU states have not been able to agree to a common approach to the crisis.
At a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September) the EU interior ministers want to make a new attempt at a mandatory redistribution of a further 120,000 refugees.
In view of the heavy influx of refugees into Germany, the Federal government wants to provide more support to the states with initial reception and distribution of people.
The Federal government will manage this jointly with the states, announced Merkel late on Tuesday evening after a discussion lasting almost four hours with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor's office in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection will get it.
But those who have no prospects of permanent residency will not be able to stay in Germany.
This opinion is also clearly generally shared.
The Chancellor stressed that the country as a whole must now make a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are currently stuck on the Balkan route.
On Monday night Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia.
A few hours later the government in Budapest announced that it was also going to seal off the border with Romania with a fence.
Unlike Serbia these neighbouring countries belong to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent people smugglers finding alternative routes through Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto about the planned new border fences.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
The first arrests of people who had breached the fence have taken place.
In Turkey meanwhile, according to eyewitness reports, thousands more migrants are heading for the Greek borders.
