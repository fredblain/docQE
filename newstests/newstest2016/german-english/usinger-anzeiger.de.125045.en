Not a diet fruit – mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic, juicy and sweet.
But anybody watching their waistline should avoid them.
Because mangoes have a relatively high sugar content – primarily sucrose.
The exotic fruit is nevertheless healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. But most of all mangoes are full of vitamin A and its precursor, beta-carotene.
Eating the fruit boosts the sight, immune system and the body's metabolic processes.
When buying mangoes they should not be too soft or too firm and they should have a pleasant aroma.
It is not possible to tell from the colour of the skin how ripe the fruit is – even green mangoes can taste delicious.
They should be kept at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
They are delicious on their own or in sweet dishes.
A mango also gives a special touch even to savoury dishes.
They mitigate the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radicchio.
And a mango chutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
