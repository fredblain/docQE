EU wants to double the mercury limit in predatory fish
The EU commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish and consumers therefore can expect a significantly higher dose of this neurotoxin.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, to which an EU working paper on the subject was made available, is heavily critical of the plans. "Risks and side effects of inappropriate industry and environmental politics will be passed on with full force to pregnant women and small children," declared Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits for the neurotoxin for large fish at the end of the food chain such as for example shark or swordfish are going to be raised from 1 to 2 mg of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
Large predatory fish however are today so heavily contaminated with mercury that based on the still current limits some 50 percent of catches may not be sold.
Once the limit has been doubled, however, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this relaxation the EU, according to Foodwatch, wants to tighten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 mg to 0.1 mg of mercury per kilogram.
But Foodwatch describes this as a "trick", because smaller prey fish, such as for example carp, generally have so little contamination that these planned maximum levels are already complied with today.
The reduction for small fish therefore is "a perfidious diversionary tactic which helps only the economy," declares Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is for human beings a highly toxic heavy metal which accumulates largely in the food chain, above all in predatory fish.
For this reason the German government has issued a warning that "even low levels, particularly in unborn children, can lead to damage to the nervous system".
The German Environment Minister, however, declared on his home page with regard to the current maximum levels that a "health risk to the general population" is not anticipated.
Mercury is released into the environment primarily through the burning of coal.
German coal plants, according to written information from the German Ministry of the Environment to Green Bundestag member Annalena Baerbock, discharge more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, is "extensively exceeded on a long-term basis," the "Spiegel" newspaper quoted from the paper in March.
In the past year, Europe-wide alerts on mercury in fish rated among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
