Munich, Sylt und Co.: the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
The most expensive residential developments are located here in Hobookenweg – with a view over the North Sea mudflats.
On this road one square metre of a thatched house costs an average of €73,300.
"On Sylt, the number of properties on offer is naturally limited," says a study – hence the high prices.
This new study indicates the particular locations with the most expensive accommodation per square metre.
Of course, €18.70 per square metre for student digs in Munich is not really low.
Compared with Germany's top areas, however, this price seems likes peanuts.
Property service Engel & Volkers has published a league table of the most exclusive residential areas in Germany - with staggeringly high prices per square metre.
More than €10,000 is nothing there - per quare metre, mind you.
Ok, if you can't afford it...
Incidentally, for once Munich is not in the lead.
