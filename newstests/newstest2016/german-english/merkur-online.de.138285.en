Exceptions for the new Bernried sports hall
Bernried district council has approved the planning application for the €2.3 million sports hall.
And it is making an exception.
The roof may be flatter to accommodate a solar energy system.
Planning for the long-awaited sports building on the Bernried sports ground are moving ahead step by step: in the latest council meeting the planning application was approved unanimously without any great discussion.
The committee had earlier agreed, among other things, to an "exception", or rather an "exemption" under building law to the applicable building plan.
The "exception" refers to permission for a special shape for the roof structure.
According to this a "gable roof with an off-centre ridge and roof overhang" will be constructed.
The background for the plan is the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels. "This means we will have a wonderfully large south-facing roof," explained mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "exemption" on the other hand refers to the roof pitch, which for energy reasons - contrary to the stipulations in the development plan - will be less than 10 degrees.
This will reduce the volume of the hall.
Therefore an "exemption" is necessary, since the development plan allows no "exceptions" with regard to roof pitch - while the Bernried council as a rule has a more restrictive approach to requests for exemptions.
The sports hall is however more of a recurring project. "We are not setting a precedent with this," says Steigenberger.
The hall at the sports centre is a joint project between the district and SV Bernried.
Costs have been calculated at around €2.3 million.
Contributions are expected through funding from schools and popular sports.
In the next step of the project, the planning application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will be presented to the district administration for review.
