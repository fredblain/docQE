Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented switch to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has played for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015.
A few years ago, FC Bayern was apparently close to committing to Spain's superstar Xavi, who at the time was playing for FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times Champions League winner, twice club world champion, twice European champion, one time world champion - Xavi's list of titles is breath-taking.
In the summer the then 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and transferred to Qatar and the al-Sadd Sport Club.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi reveals now that just before the 2008 European Championship he was ready to leave Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"At the time Madrid were winning everything and we weren't," he says.
And FC Bayern noticed that too.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted to have me."
A quick reminder: in the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over at FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not transfer.
The transfer never happened.
And instead the crucial man now works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why. "Barça had signed on Guardiola and I played a brilliant European Championship."
"Pepe told me that I shouldn't transfer, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"He got me with that."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have turned out if Xavi had left.
Xavi covered the entire distance on the turf for Barça in the quarter final of the Champions League against Bayern, knocked the Reds out (4:0, 1:1) and at the end celebrated the premiere class triumph.
