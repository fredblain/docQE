Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teheran's destabilising activities in the Middle East.
The meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disputed two state solution.
Relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been strained for years.
Washington criticises the continuous building of settlements in Israel and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of initiative in the peace process.
The relationship between the two has further deteriorated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran's atomic programme, .
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu made a controversial speech to the US Congress, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech had not been agreed with Obama, who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time impending in Israel.
