Croatia: "We are letting the refugees through"
"Border control is being brought in now on our southern border too," says Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
In parallel, checks on the Hungarian border remain in place.
It is still a priority that anyone wanting to claim asylum can "of course" do so.
The care and safety of people is paramount.
It is equally clear "that obvious signals are needed," says the minister.
People must know that we do not accept an unlimited flow of migration, and not over the Austrian-Slovenian border either.
A controlled procedure is required
Croatia is considering a "corridor" - Slovenia has refused.
The Croatian government had earlier announced that Slovenia also wanted to let incoming refugees travel through towards Austria and Germany, and also potentially establish corridors for the refugees.
However, Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach did not see it in quite the same light.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," Sloveina intends rather to step up its surveillance of the borders - especially the border to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, as the external border to the Schengen area, is however already heavily controlled.
But as the Minister stressed, Slovenia is not suggesting sealing its borders for refugees.
"Every member of the EU has to fulfill its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees attempted to enter Eastern Croatia on Monday night over the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing, in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby maize field.
Since then, according to local media, police vehicles are constantly coming across new refugees in Croatian Tavarnik.
They are mostly Syrian and Afghans, among them many women and children.
The emergency sevices and the Red Cross are also already in place.
Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic says that his country is expecting around 4000 refugees in the next few days.
In addition it was reported by both Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday that buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which have up to now taken migrants to the Hungarian border, are being diverted to Croatia
The government in Belgrade denied, however, that it is the case that they are giving people instructions to take certain routes. "We neither can nor want to do that," they stated.
According to media reports, at least one bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the early hours, and in the course of the day more buses are expected.
Over Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The detainees were travelling the entire night through Serbia from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometres away.
"We heard that Hungary is closed, so the police said we should come here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to go through Croatia, Slowenia and Austria to get to Germany.
This implies that a shift in the former Balkan route through Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary to a route somewhat further to the west, which observers have already predicted, could actually now be happening.
Croatia: "Widespread options for border control"
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country has already prepared appropriate plans for potential exceptional situations in the event of a large influx of refugees.
He gave no details, but he indicated that Croatia, as a non-member of the Schengen Treaty, has "widespread options for border control."
Rigorous checks are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schegen area.
Slovenia has been a member since 2007, since when its EU partners have presented a consistently good report on the country as far as border controls are concerned.
There are also some 300 refugees stuck on the Serbian side behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to media reports from Belgrade, they spent the past night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
The Hungarian authorities claim that both the Horgos and the Backi Breg border crossings also remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel on to the Croatian border is still not clear.
At a local appearance on Wednesday morning, the Serbian Interior Minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic, tried to reassure people: he considers the debate on the refugees' alternative routes after the closure of the Hungarian border to be premature.
At the moment there is not a large number of refugees involved.
It is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Aid workers advise migrants to take - dangerous - alternative routes.
But private Hungarian aid workers have already started to distribute maps marked with alternative routes through Croatia to refugees
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is however not without danger: in parts of the border region, even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, there are still uncleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of minesweepers has been sent to the border region.
