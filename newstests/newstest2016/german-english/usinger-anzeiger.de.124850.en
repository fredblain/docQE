Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, believes that military action in Syria with participation from Germany is a possibility.
"I believe that determined consideration about military courses of action should not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European nations of "collectively looking the other way".
Four years ago one would have been happy for the chalice of military involvement to pass Germany by.
"Now the conflict has come crashing down at our front door," he said on the German World Service.
The former German Ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid locally for the refugees.
