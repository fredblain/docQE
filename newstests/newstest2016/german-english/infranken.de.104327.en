Rosberg's only motto: full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in his fight for the Formula One world championship title against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full attack".
The world championship runner-up stressed before the start of the decisive seven overseas races "that I've got nothing more to lose".
Before the night race in Singapore this Sunday, 53 points divide the vice world champion from the titleholder and two times champion Hamilton.
The Brit has already won seven of the 12 races of the season to date and is also starting the floodlit Grand Prix in the city state as favourite.
In 2009 and in the preceding year the 30-year-old Brit was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have any influence on the Grand Prix in Singapore is as yet unclear.
A pall of smog has been hanging over the city for days, caused by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
