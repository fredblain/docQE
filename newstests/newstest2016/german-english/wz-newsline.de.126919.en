Decoration instead of curtains – Plauen lace as a fashion niche
There used to be long embroidery machines in and around Plauen making many metres
of embroidered fabrics and laces in vast quantities for customers who made, for example, table cloths and curtains.
This is no longer the case today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is once more important.
In the early days of Plauen lace, fashion played a large role, then it was replaced by the home textile industry – and now it is being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gave a few examples: lace in decoration, for accessories such as bags and for traditional costumes.
Generally, so-called vintage fashion, based on style eras from the past, is producing an increasing potential for orders.
Anyone in the textile industry in Germany who cannot serve a niche is no longer in the market.
We are already getting half of all our contracts this way.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other businesses, is a member of the Plauener Spitze und Stickereien trade association.
Only they are allowed to bear the protected label.
Sales have fallen by around 80 percent over the last 15 years.
There are now hardly any private speciality shops or wholesalers.
Our products hardly reach the customers over these channels.
Nowadays mass produced goods are manufactured much more cheaply in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains.
Furthermore exports to Russia and the USA are currently weakening slightly.
This is enough reason for new directions.
The trade association is also trying to score with environmental consciousness, as Cordelia Bauer of Stickperle in Falkenstein explains. "As of this year we have implemented a seal of quality which shows that our production is ecologically and socially compatible.
Reinhardt added, "This also applies to the materials we use".
Qualified designer Ute Schmidt teaches in the faculty for applied arts at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxony University of Zwickau and specialises in embroidery and lace.
In order to face the competition from the Asian regions one has to find high-quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the designers' newest ideas and businesses, who must think primarily in commercial terms," says Schmidt.
This is why existing designs are often only slightly varied in order to keep core customers.
A few years ago textile designer Kati Reuter revitalised the historic snowball lace.
The machines embroider small beads in selected places.
Plauen master goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this. "In the past I had no use for traditional Plauen lace".
Now she uses the snowball lace for her jewellery.
Using an elaborate process she embosses the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with Plauen lace – young and old," says Reuter.
She also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland – primarily to customers whose forefathers lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want to have a memento.
So with my jewellery I see myself as a modern ambassador for Plauen lace.
