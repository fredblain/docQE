440 hp sports car rented and written off
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfil a dream and rented a Ford Mustang.
He got a rude awakening on the wet motorway.
A company in the district of Gotha allows you to fulfil your dream by renting out and driving an American V8 Ford Mustang Boss 302 440 hp sports car.
So the 29-year-old from the Gotha district did just that.
The end of his dream came on the A 71 motorway near Arnstadt.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into a skid on the wet road and drove into the crash barrier.
The sports car was a write-off but no one was injured.
Damage is estimated at â‚¬40,000.
