Refugees have safe conduct: Croatia and Slovenia put corridor in place
Since Hungary has virtually stopped letting them through, the choice of more and more refugees is the route over Croatia.
Zagreb has announced that they will allow passage over Slovenia towards the north without obstacles.
However the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to come to an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister for the Interior, and if necessary we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Minister for the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone.
EU member Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the sealing off of the Serbian Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees set out for Croatia in order to reach West Europe from there.
Five hundred people came over the border at Tovarnik, reports Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had cordoned off its borders for refugees the previous day.
Moreover, new laws which came into force on the same day make fair asylum proceedings in Hungary practically redundant.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic explains, "They may pass through and we are preparing ourselves for this possibility".
These people are there, they are women children and men who want to live and to achieve something.
They are however people who do not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police picked up the first refugees on the Serbian border to EU neighbour Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports most come from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived at the Serbian border town of Sid both by bus and in taxis.
Immediately after their arrival they tried to reach the green border to Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border the refugees did not come across border fences.
The border strips hold other dangers: there are still active mines there from the Yugoslavian civil war in the 90s.
It is now planned for minesweepers to quickly create a safe passage.
Meanwhile after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday police counted 366 people that they had picked up.
Shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday the number was 9,380.
The new Hungarian laws classify climbing and damaging the border fences as criminal offences.
This has led to 35 criminal proceedings being initiated in the South Hungarian border town of Szeged.
Those convicted are threatened with sentences of up to five years and extradition from the country.
According to the immigration authorities, a total of 94 asylum applications was accepted in the new "transition zone" set up at the border, almost all – 93 – at the biggest crossing at Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning another 40 refugees were stopped there.
In practice, however, nobody else has a chance of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to opinion in Hungary, Serbia is "a safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers will be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees now are gathering by "the transition zone" in Röszke.
Workers have begun to clean up in Röszke.
They are collecting the rubbish that tens of thousands of people have left lying at the sides of the roads over the last weeks.
Crowd barriers are being dismantled and one of the reception centres in the border town is being rebuilt.
No one wants to talk about the goal of this rebuilding.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria is getting only a few refugees.
Furthermore the country has strengthened its border controls.
According to the goverment, around 20,000 migrants are still in the country.
In Salzburg, some 1,400 people are waiting to travel on to Germany.
The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
In Freilassing one regularly meets small groups of refugees on foot.
