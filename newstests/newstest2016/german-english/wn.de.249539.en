McLaren reserve driver Magnussen out of actionâ€¦
Magnussen twittered a photo of the damage and explained that he received the injury falling from a bike.
This means that his chances of being reserve driver to the two main drivers, Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, for the night race in Singapore at the weekend are as slim as those for the Grand Prix in Japan a week later.
