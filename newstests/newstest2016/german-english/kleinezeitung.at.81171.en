Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws money at traffic warden
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese attracts the wrong sort of attention in Bremen
He was once a footballer but now Tim Wiese, ex-national goalie for Germany who also played for Bremen and Hoffenheim, is a wrestler.
According to him he wanted to put on 30 kg of muscle mass in the past two years.
On the other hand he hasn't put on any intellectual weight.
Wiese was just having his hair cut in the centre of Bremen when outside he saw a traffic warden putting a penalty notice on his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese stormed out of the hairdressers, abused the officer and threw down the money for the fine at her feet, according to a report in the "Bild" newspaper.
The accusation has been confirmed by the town of Bremen but it is not yet known what the consequences of this extraordinary incident will be.
"The matter is still being investigated," says a spokesperson for the town of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether charges are going to be pressed against Wiese.
