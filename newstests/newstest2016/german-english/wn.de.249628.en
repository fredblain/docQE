Football: BVB v Krasnodar without Reus: Weidenfeller in goal
All hopes have been crushed for Borussia Dortmund that Marco Reus might make a comeback in the first group match of the European league.
The international player will also be missing from the German Bundesliga leader's match in its dual with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7 p.m. on Sky).
"Unfortunately he isn't in the running," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
The BVB coach is leaving it open as to whether Reus will be there on Sunday in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen: "We are expecting him to return to training on Friday".
In light of the heavy burden on his professionals, Tuchel does not want to change his first choice 11 just because of Reus's position.
So he has announced a change of goalkeeper.
Thus Roman Weidenfeller is taking the place of regular keeper Roman BÃ¼rki.
"He's training at absolute top level," praised the world champion's football coach.
Tuchel is leaving it open as to whether Weidenfelder will be used in all European league matches in the future.
It is highly likely that he will also play the second game.
Midfielder Julian Weigl considers team mate Reus's brisk statement that the final of the European league must be BVB's objective quite understandable: "Marco isn't so far off the mark with that".
"I think we've got a good chance of picking up the title."
