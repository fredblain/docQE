Owner of Lia Peroni opens second business in the arcade.
In the new shop the focus is on Furla handbags.
Jutta Breit actually wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old proprietor of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt arcade had to unceremoniously postpone this plan: now she has finally expanded by taking on new premises
In the Furla shop opposite the business where she sells among other things bags, cases, shoes and garments from different manufacturers, everything now revolves around Furla women's handbags; purses can be obtained starting at €75.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to €500.
The new shop opened yesterday.
It has been converted over the last few weeks.
"I have been considering for a long time whether I should open another shop," says Breit.
Crucial for this decision was among other things that the Furla manufacturers, who are based in Bologna, were impressed with the idea of their own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only people in the greater Lintz area who sell this brand," said the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Breit got her interest in fashion from her mother, when she was still in the cradle.
It suits me best if something emerges and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
The expert can with absolute certainty give me the answer to the question of why so many women go into raptures at the sight of a beautiful handbag.
Perhaps it's because a beautiful handbag can enhance any outfit.
