Villingen-Schwenningen: three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver received minor injuries in a collision on the cross-over between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old lorry driver drove onto the cross-over in the direction of the industrial estate roundabout and realised too late that two vehicles in front had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result he ran into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle into the Ford Fiesta stopped in front of it.
Damage amounting to around â‚¬10,000 was suffered by the vehicles involved, according to the police.
The Audi belonging to the 33-year-old could no longer be driven and had to be towed away.
