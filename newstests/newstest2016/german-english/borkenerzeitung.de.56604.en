Pegida poster suggests the idea of potato doner kebabs to Lebanese man
Potatoes or doner kebab?
You can have both â€“ in the potato kebab that Oldenburg snack bar owner Hani Alhay has created.
Inspired by the slogan "potatoes instead of kebabs" on a Pegida movement poster, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a skewer.
A poster at a Pegida demonstration with the slogan "Potatoes instead of kebabs" which he happened to see on television gave him the idea.
Since then a spit laden with meat and potatoes has been rotating in his shop.
"That is multi-cultural food!" says Alhay.
Now he has registered his idea at the patent office in Munich.
According to officials there it is now protected as a registered design.
Because of this, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the spit holds.
Just enough so that, "They taste much better together," he reckons.
Customers also appreciate this international culinary understanding.
