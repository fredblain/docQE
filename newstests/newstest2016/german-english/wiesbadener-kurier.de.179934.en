DFB steps up its commitment to refugees
The German football league gave clear indications at the weekend that the DFB is extending its commitment to refugees to 2019.
Football has reacted to the deteriorating situation in Germany and promised politicians its help with the current problems.
"I consider this to be the biggest challenge in our country since reunification."
"Basically nobody knows, it's no concern of mine, it's not my doing."
"It is in the interests of everybody to get to grip with this issue," says DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
He wants to debate the subject of the refugee situation in Germany intensively at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin.
I'm going to be in the Chancellor's office next Wednesday and I'm meeting there with State Minister Ms Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"I'm sure the topic will play a central role there," he announces.
Football can and will help.
But the politicians must set the deciding guidelines.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" to four years.
"Through the Egidius-Braun foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019," declared Niersbach on the brink of the UEFA meeting in St Julian's, Malta
Several teams are also supporting the programme.
This very weekend the 36 professional clubs will be sending out a clear message when they wear the words "We are helping – #refugeeswelcome" on the left sleeve of their strip instead of the usual sponsor's logo (Hermes).
"We are doing this to make it clear that everyone should help where and in any way they can," Leverkusen's sport boss Rudi Völler told the "Bild" newspaper on Tuesday, and describes the scheme as "a matter of course".
"The refugee drama concerns everyone, nobody can look away."
"We football teams can, no, we must use our charisma, our influence, and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered tremendously," says Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a prominent signal by the league.
The women's national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle (Saale) for the World Cup qualifying match against Hungary.
Niersbach describes supporting the refugees as "a grand joint effort by German football."
It is amazing that all 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their own locations.
It is just as amazing that both small and large clubs are doing this.
The message "1:0 for a welcome," that we have sent out is being lived in football.
"That is of enormous significance," he said.
In both this year and next year the association together with the DFB team and the Federal government are making €300,000 available for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already already released the entire sum for 2015," reports Niersbach.
