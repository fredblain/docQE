How to share your stories, pictures and videos with BBC News
Every day BBC News - on TV, on radio and online - brings you the latest stories from across the globe... but what we want to hear are the issues that matter to you.
The part you play in making the news is very important.
Whether it is breaking news or a featured item, your contribution can make a difference.
Have you seen or been involved in a news event?
Is something significant, bizarre or unusual happening where you live?
Have you got a story to tell or is there something you think we should follow up?
Are there topics you want to get the world talking about?
What do you want to comment on?
Or do you want to find out what others are talking about?
