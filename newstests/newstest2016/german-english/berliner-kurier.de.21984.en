Justin Bieber in the capital city: on a Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, megastar.
A ridiculous 21 years young, a wimpy kid with a too trendy haircut.
The guy with the platinum blond hair is worth a hundred million euros.
Probably even more.
At the moment Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the under-17 generation is going berserk.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name Ritz Carlton.
Not so bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Eva and Viktoria from Poland.
But the Poles have been sitting on the cold stone slab in front of the luxury Berlin hotel on the Potsdamer Platz since 7 o'clock in the morning.
The Bieber building: their idol, whose face appears on huge numbers of posters in Szczecin, has been staying here since Monday evening.
The suite where the Canadian singer is staying costs as much for one night as her mother Ewa earns in six months.
At least.
She says: "My Viktoria should really be sitting in the 10th class in the grammar school at the moment."
"I'm fulfilling her dream for her."
Compulsory education?
Who wants that?
Not the fans.
Nor Bieber himself.
He is financially secure anyway.
He is earning three million for advertising in the commercial break at the Super Bowl, a two-year deal with an anti-spot company pours many many dollars into Bieber's account.
And for every doll that looks like him and passes over the counter Bieber cashes in as well.
When Justin Bieber drinks coffee people goggle through the window.
He has looted more than a hundred million like that.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others point out that after all Bieber is charting in both the USA and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" at number one.
Bieber himself, whose new album is due out in November, is not interested in all those zeros.
At least that's what he says.
