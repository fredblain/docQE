Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" film
You shouldn't interfere with legends, but Disney is daring to make a new film of the classic "Mary Poppins" anyway.
But according to "Entertainment Weekly" it is not going to be a remake but a sort of sequel, set 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the nanny's experiences with the Banks family in the time of the Great Depression in England.
Who is going to take the role of Mary Poppins, played 50 years ago by Julie Andrews, is not yet certain.
But the director has been decided: Rob Marshall, whose most recent film was "Into the Woods".
