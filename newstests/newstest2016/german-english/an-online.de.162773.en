Archaeologists discover ancient remains on the banks of the Rhine at Cologne
Archaeological finds have again been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Archaeologists from the Roman Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historical buildings near the site where the new Rhine Boulevard is being constructed , said museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Historians have been in search of so-called architectural monuments since the start of construction work on the Rhine.
The museum, as the department for archaeological monument conservation, is always consulted when construction projects are carried out in the city district of Cologne.
The archaeologists made a find in the third construction phase of the Rhein Boulevard.
It is already known from text documents that a fortress stood on this spot in the 4th century, and in the 8th century a church, explained Trier.
Besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves, which probably belonged to the church, has also been discovered.
