Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a podium.
He was unhurt, but video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mr Mugabe during his address.
Last month, they booed and heckled him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) chief whip Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Nr Mugabe's address.
"The message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it's titled 'death'," he told journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate.
The chief whip said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "worried" about the threats to its politicians.
