Boll not to play in team and doubles in European Championship
As things stand, the Dusseldorf player plans to play only in the singles in the competition, running from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision will be made on 22 September.
"It is a major loss for our team."
"The lads heard about it this morning."
"But we are strong enough to pick up the title without Timo," said national coach JÃ¶rg Rosskopf during European Championship training in Dusseldorf.
At this time Boll was on a flight to a long arranged appointment with sponsors in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo we have the disadvantage of no longer being the clear favourites," declared individual European champion Dimitrij Ovcharov.
But the Hamelin player, who is the top seed in Ekaterinburg, also remembers the European Championship in Schwechat in 2013.
"We didn't have Timo then either, and we still became European Champions."
"That is what we need to focus on," declared the world number five.
