Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his side's tackling as "agenda setting" by the NRL's two premiership favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to "wrestle" his side during the Storm's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm after his side's qualifying final win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called that game a "showcase" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland weren't "too big" into wrestling.
Bellamy defended his side's tackling and said they just focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added he took confidence from having two leading coaches criticise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them.
"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee we haven't changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques, it's just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackles and that has been the turn around for us.
Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting footy.
He made a point of comparing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a rat's arse.
But now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting footy, especially his young halves with their speed.
That's the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players.
He made that point in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of footy - not every team has two halves like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
To me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking of us when they get to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet but what was the score? 16-12?
Our game it was 20-18, there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting footy?
Or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting?
To me it's agendas.
If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there.
The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night's preliminary final at AAMI Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.
