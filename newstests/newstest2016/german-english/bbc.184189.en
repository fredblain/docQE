'Shot in Joburg': Homeless youth trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But one group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and make a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youngsters how to take photographs of their neighbourhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News went to meet one of the project's first graduates.
