<seg id="1">In 911 Call, Professor Admits to Shooting Girlfriend</seg>
<seg id="2">In a 911 call, his voice only slightly shaky, college professor Shannon Lamb told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb made a point to say his "sweet dog" was there alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the home, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a hand-written note scribbled on a white legal pad: "I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," read the letter authorities say was signed by Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history professor, Ethan Schmidt, in the doorway to his office.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the day, there would be one more death: Lamb took his own life as police closed in on him.</seg>
<seg id="9">A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="10">The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Students said they looked forward to his class.</seg>
<seg id="12">Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both taught in the Division of Social Sciences and History, which lists 17 faculty members, and many students took courses from both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, there were some inclinations of problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and jittery, "like there was something wrong with him."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, saying he had a health issue of some sort.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year, he was only teaching two online classes.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recent changes in the university's hiring policies meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor.</seg>
<seg id="21">University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."</seg>
<seg id="22">Those are questions Lamb can no longer answer.</seg>
<seg id="23">After fleeing the campus, police later picked up Lamb's trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he could be apprehended, Lamb killed himself with a single .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="25">His car was still running in the driveway.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to that home, though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in the area.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.</seg>
<seg id="29">He received a doctorate in education in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar.</seg>
<seg id="33">He was quite the heartthrob back then.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the girls would melt when he was around," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no record of them ever marrying.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog named Lightning that lived with them at the brick house that backs up to a bayou in Gautier.</seg>
<seg id="38">Police said the dog was OK.</seg>
<seg id="39">Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who's now 19.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She was completely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She and her mother were absolutely best friends.</seg>
<seg id="42">O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">Later, they played together in the occasional gig.</seg>
<seg id="45">O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss the night of Sept. 5, after Lamb had finished playing his guitar and harmonica for a sparse crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">There was no sign of anything amiss.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We were cutting up and throwing one-liners at each other.</seg>
<seg id="51">I mean, they both had a good sense of wit about them.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, the slain professor, directed the first-year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three young children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.</seg>
<seg id="55">On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students, and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."</seg>
<seg id="57">Classes resume Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is over.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is a day of healing.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">This story has been corrected to reflect that police are now saying Lamb made the 911 call after shooting Schmidt, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call, there is no indication the two ever married.</seg>

<seg id="2">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's stepped up military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only worsen the violence and misery for millions of people.</seg>
<seg id="3">The U.N. chief again urged all parties, including the divided U.N. Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria.</seg>
<seg id="5">He expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unsolvable."</seg>
<seg id="6">Ban urged the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Trump Is For Real</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to label him a flip-flopper.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others have dismissed him as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some are holding out for an implosion.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Trump down from atop the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's lead at double digits, and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate mogul's nomination chances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.</seg>
<seg id="8">None of this is to say that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pundits point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was giving way to a rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are recognizing Trump's staying power and beginning to unload their dollars to topple him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump's favorability ratings have turned 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Right before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July, it was 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In early August, it was 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now, six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative view.</seg>
<seg id="19">And these numbers hold up in early states.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same of Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next closest in enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the flip side, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of leaned Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number holds in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and almost six in 10 independents say his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters are getting used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When they put on their pundit hats, Republican voters think Trump is for real.</seg>
<seg id="34">When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll out last week.</seg>
<seg id="35">That's a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Jeb Bush in late July.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time last cycle, four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination, vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still, it shows that a plurality of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some pundits point out that the splintered field is likely contributing to Trump's lead, while anti-Trump support is be spread diffusely among more than a dozen other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that, in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always garners majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.</seg>
<seg id="43">He's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head.</seg>
<seg id="46">A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new CBS/NYT poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked in their votes.</seg>
<seg id="48">Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say they would never change their mind.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switching candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is from fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign announcement speech two months ago, immigration has been front and center in the 2016 conversation.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are worried that Trump's bombast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will remain too.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration with government is climbing to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters, largely due to their outsider status.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six in 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider over someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are angry at Washington, too.</seg>
<seg id="60">A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "mad as hell."</seg>

<seg id="1">Jeremy Corbyn to make debut at Prime Minister's Questions</seg>
<seg id="2">Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been keenly awaited</seg>
<seg id="3">New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, taking on David Cameron for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six allotted questions shortly after midday, with his performance likely to be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour MPs.</seg>
<seg id="5">He has called for "less theatre and more facts" at the weekly showpiece.</seg>
<seg id="6">He has also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, coming after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and did recognise the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "irrespective" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are also "stacking up" within Labour following Mr Corbyn's appointment over its position on the European Union and the government's cap on benefits.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hours later Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £26,000 to £23,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the despatch box over the past decade since he became Tory leader.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Islington North MP has said PMQs is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "repartee" and trading barbs, instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will deputise for him at PMQs when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying he had approached the Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics often associated with PMQs but admitted some years later that he had failed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since it was first televised in 1990, PMQs has been seen as a key barometer of a leader's judgement, their command of the Commons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a caricature and is in need of far-reaching reforms.</seg>

<seg id="3">Between May and July, UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.9% compared with the same period last year.</seg>

<seg id="6">Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the food, liquor and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual investor strategy day.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="8">South Australian and Western Australian shoppers are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will snare around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Metcash's high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million in earnings before interest and tax, Mr Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, even though a recent Roy Morgan survey found IGA shoppers were most loyal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food and grocery sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "highly, probably disappear within a decade.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Metcash's food and grocery business, which supplies about 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operating deleverage as sales and margins come under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million a year matching shelf prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers refurbish stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and rolling out a better range of private label groceries.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says the price matching and store refurbishment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the wholesaler will return to underlying profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves kudos rather than criticism for his behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves kudos rather than criticism for his own behaviour, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the "Special Ks," was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyrgios sledge of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the chair umpire, with Harrison declaring: "Wawrinka should've decked Kyrgios, and I should deck that kid."</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was last seen smashing a racquet after cramp foiled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis has been defended staunchly by Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second singles berth behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing I do feel quite keenly about is I think Thanasi's been dragged into the fray a little bit," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He did break a racquet when he lost when he cramped in the US, but he's not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn't be proud of that.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he's handled himself extremely well, in pretty provocative circumstances in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.</seg>
<seg id="11">He's a great team around him, he's got a great family around him and I just think he's been a little hard done by.</seg>
<seg id="12">He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in with the team and so on, he hasn't ever had an issue with the other players, he's well respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he's in great shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for the important tie, starting on Friday, describing the "mutual decision" as the right thing for all, but backing the Canberran to return as a long-term fixture in the team.</seg>
<seg id="14">"First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think Nick, he's risen very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he's growing up in the public eye and he's made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the limelight where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it's best for the team and it's best for him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Europe migrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency, seals border, detains migrants</seg>
<seg id="2">Declaring a state of emergency, Hungary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally, aiming to shut down the flow of migrants pouring in.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants piled up in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.</seg>
<seg id="4">Stuck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries' checkpoints, those fleeing violence in their homelands pitched tents and settled in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But frustrations were on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a police helicopter hovered above, migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some refused food and water in protest.</seg>
<seg id="8">Serbia's foreign minister declared it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.</seg>
<seg id="9">(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.</seg>
<seg id="10">There will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece and spoke hopefully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120,000 more refugees, including some from Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hungary, however, was not pinning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum court cases.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a razor-wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were enlisted in the race to finish the razor wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for migrants, many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most arriving are economic migrants seeking a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations, including Germany.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) razor-wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of crisis," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We are very clear on this: Illegal border crossing is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Technically, parliament must still approve the deployment of the military, expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gyorgy Bakondi, homeland security adviser to Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">They got across by damaging the fence, are now in police custody and are being charged with committing offenses under the new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hungarian officials also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deploying a train car covered with razor wire to close one of them.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chaos enveloped the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal container to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside.</seg>
<seg id="29">About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary, saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national poll</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second, with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the primary contests, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since last month's CBS News Poll, Clinton has lost ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now even.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Clinton still has a large lead with older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point edge with this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support her.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her.</seg>
<seg id="17">Views are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton, fewer Republican voters say that about their frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the nominee, the top answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by it's time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).</seg>
<seg id="21">Agreement on the issues, and electability are also cited.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the vice president weighs a potential run for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don't think he should.</seg>
<seg id="23">When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the top pick.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among Clinton supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders widens, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is a distant second on this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the most electable has risen.</seg>
<seg id="28">Still, when asked which is more important in a nominee, Democratic voters pick issues over electability.</seg>
<seg id="29">Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, perform well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and as having strong leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden does the best of the three on honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him on this.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as in line with their views ideologically.</seg>
<seg id="35">On all of these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">As questions continue about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn't impacted their overall views of her.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it's a different story among the American public overall.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while just about a third are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">The public's views on this were split back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is mainly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have become worse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think of her as honest and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks on leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush do the best on honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">More see Sanders as honest than not, but like Carson, many don't have an opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump in the newest CBS News/New York Times poll</seg>
<seg id="3">The two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll, leaving others scrounging for a foothold</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican voters nationwide continue to back Trump in large numbers, climbing from 23% support in the last CBS poll, conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% in the poll out Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Carson rocketed in that same period from 6% to 23%.</seg>
<seg id="6">The survey also found Carson doing well across demographic groups, edging out Trump among college-educated Republican voters.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, has slipped behind with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling farthest from 10% support last month to 2% now.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio all tied for third place with 6%.</seg>
<seg id="9">The margin of error for the 376-person sample of Republican voters in this newest poll is plus-or-minus 6%, and was conducted Sept.</seg>
<seg id="10">The latest CNN/ORC survey, released last week, showed Carson rising in the polls -- landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump's 32% support.</seg>
<seg id="11">The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.</seg>
<seg id="12">Facing a rising Carson last week, Trump took some potshots at the retired neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman</seg>
<seg id="2">Nearly two years after a college student died during a fraternity hazing ritual in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, murder charges have been filed against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of New York City's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation rite in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said he was blindfolded, saddled with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly tackled while he tried to walk toward a target across a frozen field.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Deng eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital, police say.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president to seek advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, members began to hide paraphernalia and basically put the fraternity's well-being over that of Michael Deng's," Chief Wagner said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He could not be revived and he died the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to an autopsy report, Deng was subjected to repeated blunt force trauma to his head, torso, and thighs.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have been devastated as a result of fraternity hazing, with at least one student dying every year from hazing since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng's family, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is an important one.</seg>
<seg id="13">A Monroe County grand jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault hazing and criminal conspiracy.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We want to hold not only the individuals involved, but if there's an organization that sanctioned it, whether officially or unofficially, we're going to hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity revoked its affiliation with the local chapter.</seg>

<seg id="1">Here's what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">A rate hike will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">This we know.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we don't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the economy specifically, history offers little guide about timing.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are, indeed, multiple variables at play.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, however, market participants may find that all the rate-hike fuss may have been overdone.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of 'cheap money,' " Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">That's not to say there won't be effects, however.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's a look at how some areas of the economy could react, based on historical trends:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen over the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">Once the hike hits, though, the impact is not as dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-24 months after the first hike, which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">More specifically, the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent) then back to normal once 500 days have passed, with average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, posted on Barron's.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate-hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help them along.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could hasten a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Most notably, gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice has nominal year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, few expect that to last, with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Hiking rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants have been bracing for a Fed hike all year, with all eyes turned toward this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike at this meeting, futures trading indicates just a 25 percent probability.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study since 1950, all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP eclipsing prerecession peaks very quickly post the recovery commencing," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="29">By contrast this has been a uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and this is 74 months and counting.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fixed income also has been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience.</seg>
<seg id="32">The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy.</seg>
<seg id="33">For bonds, it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike/cut in the cycle arrives.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Charles Schwab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between longer- and shorter-dated bonds to move closer together, flattening the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-yield bonds often perform better in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about stretching for yield," Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interestingly, Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightens policy.</seg>
<seg id="40">Broadly speaking, companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinationals with lots of debt will fare worse, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to outperform during the three months following an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.</seg>
<seg id="43">Firms with strong balance sheets outpaced weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994, 1999, and 2004 rate hikes, by an average of 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also outperformed their lower quality counterparts, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt will become a big issue.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high percentage of floating rate debt stand to lose the most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside pure stock plays, consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see gains as well through higher yields at the, though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold.</seg>

<seg id="8">"Radio 3 seems to be - I don't like to use the word "dumbing down" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Brits by another name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So, if you're trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you're actually just mimicking what is already on the market," Mr Bingham said.</seg>
<seg id="12">BBC director general denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educating the public.</seg>
<seg id="13">What I learn from Radio 3, I am not going to learn about classical music from anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it's commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none.</seg>
<seg id="15">"And also, Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past, because Britons are less educated about classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC's output which came under fire for treading on the toes of commercial rivals, during the Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a particularly BBC way."</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit from our own in-house stable" next time it launches an entertainment series.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future, or spending licence fee payers' money on other entertainment formats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Internet sales increased at slowest ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame</seg>
<seg id="2">First three months of 2015 saw seven per cent increase in online sales</seg>
<seg id="3">Last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000</seg>
<seg id="4">Online sales bolstered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe November's Black Friday could be holding back spending</seg>
<seg id="6">For over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain's high streets into ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="7">But experts say there are now signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with just a five per cent rise on last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts say there are signs that online sales are leveling off, after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015</seg>
<seg id="10">'If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000, it was always going to rationalise over time,' Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="11">He explained that online sales were bolstered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.</seg>
<seg id="12">It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different contexts, such as on the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="13">But now that is plateauing a bit, you might see (growth) fall away.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Black Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales.</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November .</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to snap up deals crashing a number of retailers websites.</seg>
<seg id="17">Experts believe Black Friday, which saw shoppers fight over bargains, could be holding shoppers off from making purchases</seg>
<seg id="18">Research published by the British Retail Consortium found just over £1 in every £5 was being spent online.</seg>
<seg id="19">For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online, rather than using high street fashion chains.</seg>

<seg id="2">Bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first funerals take place in Mecca</seg>
<seg id="3">Come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group</seg>
<seg id="4">The Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed down</seg>
<seg id="5">Carried aloft through the streets, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand mosque.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dressed largely in white, mourners packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="7">The sad possession passed by the holy site, where just days earlier a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and toppled onto worshipers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.</seg>
<seg id="9">The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed when a crane crashed collapsed at Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="12">Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj to Mecca will go ahead with thousands continuing to descend on the city.</seg>
<seg id="13">Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arm up when it was not in use.</seg>
<seg id="14">An Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.</seg>
<seg id="15">The news agency's English service did not report that detail, but did say leaders of the company have been banned from travelling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to topple into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have converged ahead of the hajj pilgrimage later this month.</seg>
<seg id="17">Binladin Group has not released any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment.</seg>
<seg id="18">The royal decree also blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteorological officials.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque, part of the massive construction effort headed by the Binladin Group.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and runs major building projects.</seg>
<seg id="21">Al Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son disowned by the family in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="22">The crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every able-bodied Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="23">Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="24">Officials ordered one million riyals (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed, and the same amount to those permanently injured.</seg>
<seg id="25">Others injured will receive half that amount.</seg>

<seg id="1">B&Q boss says Eastern European tradesmen working cheap is behind trend</seg>
<seg id="2">Britons are increasingly employing handymen says Veronique Laury</seg>
<seg id="3">Number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe behind rise</seg>
<seg id="4">Resulting in 200 more Screwfix stores, aimed at tradesmen, opening</seg>
<seg id="5">At same time Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets across the country</seg>
<seg id="6">By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail</seg>
<seg id="7">Britons are said to be putting down their hammers and paintbrushes in favour of employing skilled Eastern European tradesmen to carry out work in their home</seg>
<seg id="8">If you are handy with a hammer or a whizz at painting walls, it seems you are in the minority these days.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because Britons are increasingly employing handymen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.</seg>
<seg id="10">Veronique Laury, new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement chain, said a big rise in the number of skilled tradesmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices is behind the trend.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result, Kingfisher is planning to open 200 more Screwfix stores, which are aimed at tradesmen, while closing 60 B&Q outlets.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mrs Laury said she wants more women to be employed in B&Q shops because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in store are made by the fairer sex.</seg>
<seg id="13">Currently the majority of staff are men.</seg>
<seg id="14">She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mrs Laury said: "We still have a majority of men working in our stores.</seg>
<seg id="16">We need to move more towards a balance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fundamentally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women.</seg>
<seg id="18">Women play a big part in the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain's FTSE100 index of leading firms, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women directors.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kingfisher is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team staffed by women, including its chief executive and finance director.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.</seg>
<seg id="22">It has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kingfisher posted a fall in both half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of shutting stores.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a result of the trend Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores</seg>

<seg id="2">The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday, to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it, now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-0.25 percent range.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's a historical event because it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US economy has been performing relatively well, the recovery adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation.</seg>
<seg id="7">However the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indications are they also believe the odds are against such a move.</seg>
<seg id="9">The decision is due to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Delta State University shooter left note of apology</seg>
<seg id="2">After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he "could take it back," authorities revealed Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police in Gautier, Miss. said Lamb, a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="4">Monday and said he had shot and killed someone.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send officers over to his home.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that is "not going to bother anyone" but is likely upset.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police asked the caller his name, but he didn't give it.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lamb did not provide an explanation for the shooting.</seg>
<seg id="9">When police got to the scene they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, that said: "I am so sorry I wish I could take it back.</seg>
<seg id="10">I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me.</seg>
<seg id="11">After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cops closed in.</seg>
<seg id="12">University President William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but "obviously there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind."</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "love triangle."</seg>
<seg id="14">Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely best friends."</seg>
<seg id="18">Prentiss worked an online job from her home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified as a close friend of Prentiss by the Sun Herald.</seg>
<seg id="19">Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hound dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.</seg>
<seg id="20">"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.</seg>
<seg id="21">Police said Lamb had phoned relatives at some point Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."</seg>
<seg id="22">When cops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over, bailed out on foot, ran into the woods and shot and killed himself.</seg>
<seg id="23">Lamb received a doctorate in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to his resume posted on the university's website.</seg>

<seg id="2">Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.</seg>
<seg id="3">While this left the full-back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains hopeful Shaw could play again this season.</seg>
<seg id="4">The injury was caused by a reckless tackle from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had burst into the PSV area.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required oxygen before being taken to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."</seg>
<seg id="7">He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is awful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very difficult and then plays fantastically and then this happens.</seg>
<seg id="9">When it was in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask on.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was crying.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am not a doctor but when you have a double fracture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase.</seg>
<seg id="12">I hope he can play again this season.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the concession of a spot-kick.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not penalise the Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="15">Van Gaal suggested the Italian official had erred.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a very bad tackle with two legs.</seg>
<seg id="18">A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you everyone for your messages, words can't describe how gutted I am, my road to recovery starts now, I will come back stronger."</seg>

<seg id="20">The England defender will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June.</seg>

<seg id="22">If any player goes off with this kind of injury, everybody is very sad about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="25">"He finds it very difficult because the intention was not to injure the opponent, and when you hear it is a very bad injury, it's not good," Cocu said.</seg>
<seg id="26">For me it was not possible to see the moment.</seg>
<seg id="27">The only thing I could see was the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the tackle on Luke.</seg>
<seg id="28">Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.</seg>
<seg id="29">I feel very bad about it, I am so sorry.</seg>

<seg id="1">Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better than this?</seg>
<seg id="2">It's one thing any parent soon learns: when your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unless, it seems, you are David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">Asked by a provider of holiday childcare schemes to name his favourite kids' book, the prime minister opted for The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr Seuss.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the SuperCamps company, continuing: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed."</seg>
<seg id="6">All very well, except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a précis of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Set in the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," it reads, chronicling a love interest unknown to Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="8">If that wasn't suspicious enough, Cameron's submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lorax film provided on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey."</seg>
<seg id="9">Given he is an avowedly hands-on parent, it seems unlikely Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book's plot, in which a young unnamed boy hears how the local environment was devastated by the avaricious, tree-chopping, thneed-knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squat, moustachioed creature who "speaks for the trees."</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, such a relatively lowly PR task would have been outsourced to an aide, seemingly one who has never read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron's constituency office.</seg>
<seg id="12">SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron's staff, but had no further immediate comment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of England omission but it's still tough</seg>
<seg id="2">Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough assignment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">I wouldn't rule out an away win, either.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that batting lineup and the collective mindset is strong; they will not carry scars from 2012, only a youthful positivity.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, represents an attacking option.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to omit Adam Lyth is obviously a tough one for me to analyse as his head coach at Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="8">His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on output.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were no question marks over Joe Root, for example, leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors.</seg>
<seg id="10">A couple of half-centuries and Lyth might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hopefully if he punches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me; he is a team man above all else.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how long a Test batsman gets to make his mark is a tough one.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth got seven caps - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the chance home and away.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only gripe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean first - when Lyth was in top form - but that wasted opportunity is in the past now.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes in and he is a batsman I rate highly.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is an X-factor cricketer, which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit.</seg>
<seg id="19">He must at least be afforded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the make-up of the side in the UAE.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea of Moeen opening the batting alongside Cook, which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four quicks, has been floated and it is not something I am against.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't see why a strokemaker cannot bat there and this left-hander has already shown he is one hell of a cricketer.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen may not have done the job for his county, Worcestershire, but he has been a No3 for them and there is not much difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">He peeled off three centuries immediately and did not look back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner and, in my limited dealings with him, he has struck me as very impressive young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People may look at his raw stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt but there are not a heap of spinners putting their hands up and selectors have opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn a lot on this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Away from the squad, England look to have made a couple of shrewd additions to their coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterstroke.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the game's loveliest blokes, who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it playing or coaching, and like Mahela has nous that can be tapped.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before, can freshen up a side.</seg>
<seg id="34">Colly's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes is rested for the one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this.</seg>
<seg id="35">While not everyone will agree, the coaches and selectors do not set the schedule.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you have to remember, like players, their jobs are dependent on results.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are never taken lightly.</seg>

<seg id="10">Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously level-headed chancellor, is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her, as it did for overstayers Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).</seg>
<seg id="11">France's François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is a fading force too.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland may soon have a nationalistic government of the right, Spain one of the left.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Selfie Brits, whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks, SNP-style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to hasten the Brexit process, my pal suggests.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The renegotiation was a fix" and "Britain got nothing of value out of the renegotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Europeans know to their cost how predatory Fleet Street can be and how EU-sceptic the oligarch press barons are, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum which endorsed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2:1.</seg>
<seg id="18">They may dimly remember Boris Johnson, the arch Euro-opportunist, making his name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.</seg>
<seg id="19">For all his foolishness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.</seg>
<seg id="20">They included the medley of tax-shy rascals, phone-hacking foreigners and pseudo non-doms who own most of our great newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Actually Tony Blair thought much the same about them, but realised that when you're in a cage with a randy gorilla you have to pass the bananas to distract it from having you for lunch and again for tea.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposing Cameron's referendum wheeze, since Blair had conceded the principle over the EU's aborted constitution, sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get-out card.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press never forgave him that either.</seg>
<seg id="24">But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to engage with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose BBC sofa he vacated on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I will kindly call evolving.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says he'd like us to stay in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well, most people outside Ukip's woad-wearing tendency and the wilder shores of Tory little Englanderism can probably say yes to that.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week as the boy scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 70s, when his old dad struggled on TV to be disloyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilary's struggle was more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But fighting to stay in "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell was saying, nor what JC told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever the bottom-up, touchy-feely image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and especially in the maelstrom that is social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It's fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe, allowing him to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic equivocation about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftwing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of doctrinal squabbles.</seg>
<seg id="37">As with his equivocation over Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that JC won't campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on concessions to Britain when it may all be pointless?</seg>
<seg id="39">The US is already pretty disappointed with the Brits" feeble military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Tory government in power, as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarettes review</seg>
<seg id="2">Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers have said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE published the "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">But several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy foundation" on which PHE based its main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Writing in the BMJ, two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" would be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research paper.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also endorsed BAT's public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.</seg>
<seg id="14">The rationale for selecting the members of the panel is not provided, but they include several known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PHE.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research paper produced by the group "tellingly concedes" there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been responded to before.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small by comparison, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2bn a year.</seg>
<seg id="26">By spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national remit.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 chief</seg>
<seg id="2">The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying its commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcasters.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals" biggest rating shows, and on channels such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a tie-up with the BBC without success.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcasts programmes that would clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you keep the licence fee, which I'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea, it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren't making and commissioning.</seg>
<seg id="8">They broadcast The Voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else would show that is a joke, it's ludicrous, it's obviously nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is one, EastEnders is another, admittedly made in-house.</seg>
<seg id="12">Frankly other channels would give their right arm for it.</seg>
<seg id="13">I struggle to see how it's public service broadcasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of people who work there, and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments about the BBC's most popular shows echo those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as EastEnders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said the BBC's more niche public service programmes "go on to BBC4 where quite often you can't measure the audience but they fulfil their remit and they can argue when they go on their sanctimonious missions about justifying £4bn in licence fee income, "Well of course, we do all these obscure programmes that no one watched."</seg>
<seg id="18">They put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the best value from it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course you all think, we all think, £150 a year is great value, but for people for whom £150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don't consume a lot of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="22">He said little of the BBC's output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1% of its TV output and 0.1% on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcasters in Australia and Canada and change it to "inform, enlighten and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said only a handful were shown on TV, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them all available to watch online.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Sonogenetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are too high-pitched for humans to hear.</seg>
<seg id="5">The pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light</seg>
<seg id="7">Researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure, dubbed sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nematode worms do not usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves which then pass inside the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels, found in the membranes of some of the worms" cells.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the cells they are attached to, according to a report in Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">To make ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried TRP-4 ion channels.</seg>
<seg id="14">When he applied ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves were amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they switched on the modified motor neurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pulses of light.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over that technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unlike light, which has to be sent down an optic fibre to the desired location inside the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered, and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that, using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make target human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="5">Ankle-shattering leg irons!</seg>
<seg id="6">Cluster bombs!</seg>
<seg id="7">And electric stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!</seg>
<seg id="8">The cheery voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world's biggest arms fair is a sharp spoof, produced for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to flog weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International's jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.</seg>
<seg id="9">Related: DSEI weapons fair: authoritarian regimes descend on London</seg>
<seg id="10">But a separate campaign is also leading to many posters cropping up at bus stops and on tube trains that require a second glance.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Important announcement, Travelling on the DLR from 15th to 18th September?" reads one, using London Underground fonts and branding with the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.</seg>
<seg id="12">This September, a swarm of arms dealers will be descending on the DLR ... Customers are requested to help stop the arms fair.</seg>
<seg id="13">The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy's Dismaland.</seg>
<seg id="14">A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 pack of Allen keys which it claims "gain access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet."</seg>
<seg id="15">Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the spoof ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more questioning and seeking to take political work to audiences outside galleries.</seg>
<seg id="18">A lot of artists are moving to work with activists within protest movements, realising they have to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.</seg>
<seg id="19">Another of the anti-arms trade posters greeting commuters on the tube.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Amnesty video has been watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by ad agency VCCP working pro bono, with the graphic designer and voiceover artist also working for free.</seg>
<seg id="21">VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blank space on ExCeL's calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."</seg>
<seg id="22">They toyed with creating a more realistic dodgy corporate advert, but "by ramming it home with bright colours and animation, it was more arresting."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They've done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="24">What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our doorstep.</seg>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors flog fantastically euphemistic products.</seg>
<seg id="26">In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US army for "the shoulder-launched AT4CS RS."</seg>
<seg id="27">This includes a "unique shaped-charge warhead that delivers outstanding behind-armour-effects inside the target."</seg>

<seg id="1">Eight golden rules for living in student halls</seg>
<seg id="2">It's been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an oblivious 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moving into halls can range from mildly nerve-racking to totally terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, whether and where you took a gap year, where you stand on Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite because seriously guys it's just yeast extract HAHAHA I'll be in my room."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take a breath.</seg>
<seg id="7">And help others take one too - ask questions and show interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">It steers the conversation and helps you to scout out the people you like versus those you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were dispensing extinguishers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Give people space.</seg>
<seg id="10">People's rooms often morph into drinks receptions, movie-night venues and communal hangout spots, but they're also where people get dressed and adjust their underwear.</seg>
<seg id="11">Related: Don't even think about starting university in a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">Introverts get a raw deal at university.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a retreat, yet many halls form an inter-room-strolling culture that's friendly, social and conducive to lifelong friendships.</seg>
<seg id="14">That can be hell for someone who's trying to recharge.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I've expended on interacting with you."</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socialising - and maybe text instead of knocking.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking of knocking: do it.</seg>
<seg id="18">One guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn't locked he was invited in.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw some things.</seg>
<seg id="20">Make friends through baking.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since you're starting uni at the height of Bake-Off mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate of brownies seems marginally less weird, less 1950s "Welcome to the neighbourhood, I baked you something, now smile as I ask you personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="22">Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.</seg>
<seg id="23">Your housemates will feel obliged to chat, and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Obviously this is subject to you being a decent baker.</seg>
<seg id="25">Poorly-fused lumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stealing food is a common crime in student halls.</seg>
<seg id="27">Obviously nicking someones chicken is theft, but is taking a drop of milk for your tea stealing?</seg>
<seg id="28">Double check with the milk owner.</seg>
<seg id="29">Chances are they'll tell you to help yourself even if they're seething inside.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it more maturely than my hallmate, who tainted her milk with washing-up liquid to punish those who stole it.</seg>
<seg id="31">She's in jail now.</seg>
<seg id="32">You shouldn't make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying.</seg>
<seg id="33">This isn't just to be a decent human, but because you are the proverbial people in glass houses.</seg>
<seg id="34">A girl on my corridor asked her neighbour if they wouldn't mind turning down the drum and bass because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="35">They responded by turning it up.</seg>
<seg id="36">When they finally shut up at 5am, she kindly let them sleep for two hours before blasting her own music, locking her door as she left for her three-hour exam.</seg>
<seg id="37">Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same hall as you?</seg>
<seg id="38">Conversely, wouldn't it be knuckle-bitingly awkward if you mistook a hallmate for your future spouse, hooked up, broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get custody of all your mutual friends?</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot hallmate is definitely not your future spouse, try to at least talk some sense into your groin.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the exhilarating moment you realise someone's left their keys inside their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is finer than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="41">A good prank is funny, but takes moments to reverse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Teach a valuable and amusing lesson about security by hiding something - but never trash someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lock their door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't Blu-Tack their possessions to the ceiling more than twice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Oil companies officially collapsed</seg>
<seg id="2">An investment of 400 billion dollars was shelved and most deep-sea oil exploration projects were suspended between 2014, when oil prices started to drop, and the end of last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to research from the consulting company Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices were the cause of the suspension of the 380 billion dollar-project for oil and gas exploration/production, and the production of millions of barrels of oil was postponed in a vast area reaching from the Mexican Gulf to Africa.</seg>
<seg id="4">The report showing that the biggest reason for the price drop is that oil prices have fallen from their 2014 level of 115 dollars to their lowest level in the last 12 years, losing more than 70 percent of their value in 1.5 years, includes the statement that "company budgets have dramatically shrunk".</seg>
<seg id="5">400 BILLION DOLLARS ON HOLD</seg>
<seg id="6">While the crude oil price continues to surprise every single day, it has recently fallen under the 30 dollar mark, which is its lowest level in the last 12 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">In these days of heated debates about "whether the price of oil can fall below 15 dollars", or "whether oil is dirt cheap", the research published by the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie reveals how the sector has been affected by the falling prices.</seg>
<seg id="8">Suggesting that the falling oil prices caused the suspension of 46 big energy investments worth 200 billion dollars in a report published in July, Wood Mackenzie, in new research, disclosed what the total figure was up to the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to this, while 22 more projects were postponed in the last six months of 2015, a total of 68 projects were suspended from 2014, when the drop in oil prices began.</seg>
<seg id="10">The value of these projects is estimated at around 400 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="11">2.9 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY</seg>
<seg id="12">In the research, it has been underlined that the low oil prices had a "brutal" effect on company plans and it has been noted that the projects most affected were deep water development projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">The suspended projects correspond to a total reserve of 27 billion barrels of crude oil, and the daily production of 2.9 million barrels has therefore been delayed until 2025.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the research, the final investment decision for most of the aforementioned projects was later shelved until 2017, and the first production goals are targeting the years between 2020 and 2023.</seg>
<seg id="15">The report underlines that the postponed 68 projects include a potential 170 billion dollar investment that is predicted to be carried out in the next 5 years, and "most of the 170 billion dollars is comprised of deep water projects".</seg>
<seg id="16">The reason for this is the high preliminary investment costs.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is said that "70 percent of the deep-sea expenditure is made up in particular of oil based projects in Nigeria, Angola and the Mexican Gulf in the U.S".</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the research, the countries having the biggest number of suspended projects are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="19">These six countries have almost 90 percent of the suspended liquid (oil) reserves.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia account for the biggest number of suspended gas reserves with 85 percent of the total.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most of the natural gas waiting to be extracted lies in deep waters, and requires complex and expensive solutions such as building a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="22">It has been stated that the most endangered companies are the oil giants having successive undertakings in the Canadian oil sands and the Caspian Sea Region, and it is said that these companies are trying to adapt to the scenario of "lower for longer" oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="23">EYES ON IRAN</seg>
<seg id="24">Just four years ago the situation was as follows: the U.S. and Europe imposed an embargo on Iran oil to stop Tehran's nuclear program; the barrel price of oil was around 110 dollars and debate centred on how Iran's oil exports would be cut without causing any sharp jump in the prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">When we return to this week, we witness a very different scenario.</seg>
<seg id="26">Oil prices have fallen below 30 dollars for the first time since 2004, and the principal cause of this was the production boom in the U.S.; and embargoes imposed on Iran being abolished.</seg>
<seg id="27">For this reason, all the eyes are on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="28">If Iran increases its oil exports, more oil will be added to the market, which is said to be already quite full.</seg>
<seg id="29">This may cause the price to fall below even the surprising levels of today.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some analysts are saying that Saudi Arabia, not wanting to lose any market share to Iran, will pump more oil and Iran and S. Arabia will enter a price war.</seg>
<seg id="31">Soon after the elimination of the enforcements, it is stated that the principal targets of Iran are India, being the fastest growing oil market in Asia, and its old partners in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="32">Iranian officials have previously said that they aimed to increase initial exports by 500 thousand barrels a day and to add the same amount to the market after a while.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the map data from Reuters, there are 22 very large crude carriers (VLCC) waiting off the coast of Iran, 13 of which are fully or mostly loaded.</seg>
<seg id="34">Iran is in the position of being the country with the fourth biggest proven oil reserves in the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">Thanks to exceptions within the embargo, Iran currently exports approximately 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries including Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="36">Before the embargo, Iran's daily oil export increased to 3 million barrels a day.</seg>
<seg id="37">A research specialist at securities company Destek Menkul Değerler, Aysun Göksu, answers the question of whether oil will fall below 20 dollars as follows: "China-centred global growth concerns increase downward pressure on commodity prices and intensifies the drop in oil prices."</seg>
<seg id="38">We are seeing that losses reached 20 percent since the beginning of the year amid concerns that the demand for oil would decline in line with the economic slowdown in China, which is the biggest oil importer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition to this, we may witness oil prices below 30 dollars in the forthcoming days due to the effects of the global appreciation of the dollar and the problem of global excess supply.</seg>
<seg id="40">As long as we do not see any permanent pricing above the 32-33 dollar-level, the upward movement of oil prices may remain limited and the downward pressure on prices may increase.</seg>
<seg id="41">At that point, we can say that closing prices under the 30 dollar-level will play a key role in the continuation of the decline.</seg>
<seg id="42">In this situation, it should be no surprise if it is seen that there is a loosening of the support level of 23.30-25.60 in the lower end.</seg>

<seg id="1">Isham Sardouk: "The era of angels is now over!"</seg>
<seg id="2">While carrying out the duty of trend creation in WGSN, which determines the fashion trends of Victoria's Secret and the world; why did you change your course to Turkey?</seg>
<seg id="3">- I am always pro-change.</seg>
<seg id="4">I was born in Paris, lived in London, and after that went to New York.</seg>
<seg id="5">I took up key positions there.</seg>
<seg id="6">Meanwhile, I started to provide consultancy services to Koton over the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="7">After that I saw the potential in this area and the brand Koton.</seg>
<seg id="8">I realized that everything needed to be a worldwide chain store was there.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now I'm here to make it happen.</seg>
<seg id="10">Can you achieve this in a short time?</seg>
<seg id="11">- Sure.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even though it is a small brand, it is already sold in 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="13">We launch 50 collections every year, we have 15 different sections.</seg>
<seg id="14">In other words, there is everything a chain store needs to have.</seg>
<seg id="15">We can respond to the needs of the consumers in different areas from Dubai to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="16">Currently, we are opening a store in Paris in May, and it is the beginning of a new and exciting era...</seg>
<seg id="17">Is it a must to open a store in Paris?</seg>
<seg id="18">- Yes.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not because the economic situation in Europe is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, you open some stores for image.</seg>
<seg id="21">You have stores in fashion capitals such as Paris, London and you make money in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="22">One of them adds prestige to the brand and the other adds money; both of them are necessary for a brand making an effort to be global.</seg>
<seg id="23">OK, so let's talk about the trends...</seg>
<seg id="24">- We have a romantic and chic season ahead of us.</seg>
<seg id="25">Flying chiffon dresses, smooth tones, pinks, whites, reds.</seg>
<seg id="26">Designs...</seg>
<seg id="27">We are experiencing harsh and brutal times; the fashion world always brings chic and heart-warming designs to the podium and tries to add a tiny bit of happiness to life in times like this.</seg>
<seg id="28">What we are doing is the same.</seg>
<seg id="29">For this reason, the "era of elegance" is returning in the new season.</seg>
<seg id="30">Let's go back to your years in Victoria's Secret.</seg>
<seg id="31">Who was the most legendary angel? - Karolina Kurkova.</seg>
<seg id="32">I am not talking about her gorgeous physique: She is so positive and she is such a good girl!</seg>
<seg id="33">While working, she sat beside me and said "Are you hungry, honey?" and gave me an apple, etc.</seg>
<seg id="34">In a word, she was so sweet.</seg>
<seg id="35">You also know what I am talking about, I looked into you and discovered that you have done lots of interviews with all the models of Victoria's Secret.</seg>
<seg id="36">Karolina is so beautiful, isn't she?</seg>
<seg id="37">But Adriana Lima also impressed me with her beauty...</seg>
<seg id="38">- You have a point, but that voice!</seg>
<seg id="39">Her voice, her intonation...</seg>
<seg id="40">It stresses you after a while and you say, "Sit somewhere and look beautiful; do nothing else!"</seg>
<seg id="41">It can irritate.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yes, you can experience these kinds of shocks.</seg>
<seg id="43">I done an interview with Candice Swanepoel.</seg>
<seg id="44">She was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life but I was astonished by her empty-headedness.</seg>
<seg id="45">- Most of them are like that.</seg>
<seg id="46">The new angels are not like in the past...</seg>
<seg id="47">I remember the time of Gisele...</seg>
<seg id="48">It was quite hard to work with her though.</seg>
<seg id="49">She used to come backstage and smoke like a chimney.</seg>
<seg id="50">It was not because she is addicted.</seg>
<seg id="51">Nobody can smoke you see, only she can smoke!</seg>
<seg id="52">It is just to be a "diva".</seg>
<seg id="53">Broadcast two months ago, the Victoria's Secret fashion parade got the lowest rating in its history.</seg>
<seg id="54">Why do you think that is?</seg>
<seg id="55">- As I said, that legendary era of beautiful angels is now over.</seg>
<seg id="56">Pardon me, who needs Gigi Hadid?</seg>
<seg id="57">What is beautiful about her?</seg>
<seg id="58">Kendall Jenner, for example, she is as flat as a board...</seg>
<seg id="59">There are no curves, there is nothing.</seg>
<seg id="60">Kate Moss is not curvy either but she became the biggest name in the fashion industry.</seg>
<seg id="61">- It is true but her face was so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="62">I want to use my right to object.</seg>
<seg id="63">Last year, I did an interview with her; her face has gotten quite old...</seg>
<seg id="64">- Between smoking and alcohol, she naturally lost her beauty.</seg>
<seg id="65">But she had such a beautiful face in the nineties.</seg>
<seg id="66">Her lips were like Brigitte Bardot's.</seg>
<seg id="67">She represents the end of the supermodel era.</seg>
<seg id="68">The era of Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington...</seg>
<seg id="69">Christy was my next door-neighbour and I saw her without makeup.</seg>
<seg id="70">There cannot be such pure beauty, there cannot be such elegance.</seg>
<seg id="71">What about Cara Delevingne?</seg>
<seg id="72">- She's wasting herself.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no need to be involved in every campaign.</seg>
<seg id="74">People get bored.</seg>
<seg id="75">Besides, there is no hunger for "famous models and celebrities" like in the past.</seg>
<seg id="76">People want to see real faces like their own faces in the campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="77">We will go towards this.</seg>
<seg id="78">Because the trend is this.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to reports from BBC Turkish, writers from the Worldwide Association of Writers (PEN), including its presidents in England, Wales and Scotland, stated that threats and physical attacks against their colleagues, writers and publishers in Turkey have become a normal part of life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Türk-İş says "We think that part-time rights have been given to mothers to bring in labour for hire."</seg>
<seg id="3">"It may be a Trojan horse", and TİSK claimed "We are worried about whether this regulation on behalf of women will prevent women from work or not".</seg>
<seg id="4">New rights planned for civil servants and working women after giving birth or adoption were passed by the committee after day long negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Labour for hire" became the main topic in the committee negotiations of the regulations, which will bring the right of part-time work or unpaid leave to 6 months after giving birth and part-time work up until primary school age for the child.</seg>
<seg id="6">While stating that it is proper to recruit on a part-time basis until the child starts primary school they still have worries, a CHP deputy of Izmir Musa Çam added, "If you bring the labour for hire regulation, we will stand against it to the bitter end".</seg>
<seg id="7">Taking part in the negotions on behalf of Türk-İş and saying they have the same worries, Enis Bağdadioğlu stated, "We have doubts about how the places for part-time working women will be filled".</seg>
<seg id="8">Adding that if labour for hire is added to the agenda again on this occasion there will be matters much more problematic than sub-contracted labour, Bağdadioğlu said, "We will watch the developments related to private employment agencies with much concern".</seg>
<seg id="9">The general secretary of TİSK, Bülent Pirler stated that part-time work for a period of 5 years came about with this law, and he added, "There is no part-time work for such a long period in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="10">Also look at the matter this way.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is necessary to think about the consequences of this implementation in places having 1 or 2 employees".</seg>
<seg id="12">TOBB advisor Ahmet Şağar also said that there will be problems finding workers if the regulation is implemented.</seg>
<seg id="13">Adding that there is no legislation related to the rules to be implemented on part-time work, Şağar stated, "Employers and employees should come to an agreement until regulations related to private employment agencies have been made".</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is Bergen?</seg>
<seg id="2">Bergen, whose real name is Belgin Sarılmışer, was born in Mersin on July 16, 1960.</seg>
<seg id="3">When her parents divorced in 1966, she settled in Ankara with her mother Sebahat Çakır.</seg>
<seg id="4">After attending Yenimahalle Yunus Emre Primary School, she entered the Piano Department of Ankara State Conservatory, but left because of financial difficulties and worked at the post office for a while by lying about her age.</seg>
<seg id="5">She accepted an offer of work after she took to the stage in the Feyman Night Club where she went for a night out with friends in 1979.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the Feyman Night Club, she performed Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and popular arrangements of that time with Grup Lokomotif.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moving to Adana from Ankara for work, Bergen met Halis Serbes there and married him the following year.</seg>
<seg id="8">She released her LP "I Have an Axe to Grind" with the record company Atlas Plak in 1982.</seg>
<seg id="9">While she was making her breakthrough in her artistic life, Bergen had to cope with a violent husband and she escaped from him many times.</seg>
<seg id="10">In October 1982 while working in İzmir, acid was thrown in her face under the orders of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="11">Having lost an eye and suffering burns to much of her body, Bergan was persuaded to return to the stage by Cengiz Özşeker after her treatment, who is the composer of the song "Who Knows?" popularised by Kibariye.</seg>

<seg id="16">In the same year, she appeared in front of the cameras with Yalçın Gülhan, Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron in the film "Acıların Kadını" under the direction of Ülkü Erakalın.</seg>
<seg id="17">Having built up a large fanbase, Bergen narrowly escaped a knife attack in Adana where she went to perform a concert.</seg>
<seg id="18">The artist, after having left the stage for a period, released her albums, "God Burn Him Too", "The Cost of Love" and "I Don't Want" under the direction of the great virtuosos Selami Şahin, Özer Şenay and Cengiz Tekin respectively.</seg>
<seg id="19">Officially divorcing in April 1989, Bergen made her stage comeback in June 1989 with her final album "The Years Don't Forgive".</seg>
<seg id="20">The artist, having begun a promotional tour of her album and attracting much interest, was shot and killed by her ex-husband in Pozantı, Adana on the night between August 14 to August 15, 1989.</seg>
<seg id="21">She was buried in her hometown Mersin.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bergen fit 129 songs on 5 LPs and 11 tapes, and a film into her short 29 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">Attaining great success in arabesque music with her unusual and powerful voice, the artist was declared a legend, claims that were only strengthened after her album "My Youth Has Gone", released after her death, sold out in one day.</seg>

<seg id="6">We have not yet reached 3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is an issue related to the credibility of the EU and is therefore very important", he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Juncker stated that he expected the money to be completed by January 26, which was the deadline given.</seg>
<seg id="9">Italy is one of the countries drawing attention for their positive attitudes when it comes to Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">Diplomatic sources say that Rome's stance is related to the financial package and not towards Turkey, and is related to the problems between Italy, the European Commission and some member countries of the union.</seg>
<seg id="11">There has been tension between Italy and the EU for a while now.</seg>
<seg id="12">Renzi continued to harshly criticize the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, and the EU in the latest EU summit on energy, banking and immigration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Criticizing the attitude of Renzi in yesterday's press conference, Juncker said that "Renzi should quit accusing the EU."</seg>
<seg id="14">"It is wrong of Renzi, even though I like him very much, to humiliate the European Commission on every occasion".</seg>
<seg id="15">Juncker implied that Renzi plays to internal public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="16">1 billion of the 3 billion euros, promised to Turkey, will be covered by the EU budget.</seg>
<seg id="17">2 billion euros will be covered by the budgets of the member countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">Germany will contribute at lest 427 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">It has been decided that 2.3 billion euros will be transferred to the EU budget and used to support Jordan and Lebanon by the Greek Cypriot Administration, which declared that it won't transfer money to Turkey for political reasons.</seg>
<seg id="20">The funds are predicted to be used during the 2016-2017 period.</seg>

<seg id="1">I cried when I saw the Charlie Hebdo cartoon</seg>
<seg id="2">Speaking to the Russian official news agency Sputnik, the father Abdullah Kurdi reacted strongly and said, "to tell the truth, I cried because of that cartoon."</seg>
<seg id="3">"I felt very bad".</seg>
<seg id="4">Stating that he expected positive things from the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which has become the symbol of freedom of expression after the armed attack, Kurdi added the following:</seg>
<seg id="5">They made a bad cartoon unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id="6">Everybody felt very sad about this cartoon.</seg>
<seg id="7">Aylan is a 2 year old boy and he died.</seg>
<seg id="8">Charlie Hebdo was supposed to show respect to Aylan, to me and my family, but the exact opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="9">This magazine should show respect to the dead children.</seg>
<seg id="10">They published a disrespectful cartoon about our honourable Prophet.</seg>
<seg id="11">They even made publications regarding Allah.</seg>
<seg id="12">Compared with the publications on Allah and our Prophet, what they done to my son is a small thing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Kurdi, living in Erbil, made the following appeal: "I call on the whole world and the satirical magazines to show respect to all the dead children."</seg>
<seg id="14">They should not add to the grief the families are already suffering.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tima Kurdi, an aunt of Aylan Kurdi living in Canada, is also among those to react to the cartoon.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the cartoon by Laurent "Riss" Sourisseau, it is implied that 3 year old Syrian Aylan Kurdi, whose dead body came ashore at Bodrum, "may have become one of the sex abusers in Germany when he grows up".</seg>
<seg id="17">Last year, having been exposed to an attack in which religious radicals killed 12 people because of the publication of cartoons depicting Muhammad, French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo become the focus of discussions with its cartoon of Aylan Kurdi.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the cartoon the molesters, with pig heads, evoking immigrants and also chasing women, who were portrayed like the women abused during the new year celebrations in Germany, especially Cologne.</seg>
<seg id="19">Having stirred up different reactions on social media, the cartoon is part of a column consisting of 4 frames.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This is not France" is written on the column, and the lost values of France and increasing hostility against refugees are criticized according to many readers.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, the cartoon caused many people to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.</seg>
<seg id="22">While Charlie Hebdo praised Germany, which accepted 800 thousand refugees, it criticized France for its unwilling attitude towards opening its doors to refugees in an issue published last year.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was said in the cartoon "the goal was too close" and "two children's menus for the price of one" was written in the advertising poster.</seg>

<seg id="1">What are the benefits of steam cooking?</seg>
<seg id="2">A technique that does not kill vitamins and minerals in food, steam cooking is becoming increasingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="3">Steam cooking, one of the most preferred cooking methods in the Far-East for centuries, strengthens the metabolism and makes digestion easier.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bacteria and germs in food are completely eradicated with this method, which also eliminates problems such as dyspepsia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Substances found in foods such as protein, cellulose and starch completely disolve using this technique, making the food softer.</seg>
<seg id="6">Taking place in low pressure, steam cooking is done in a cooking pot with the help of steam pots or steam machines.</seg>
<seg id="7">Both the amount of water used and the cooking time is less when cooking at high pressure.</seg>
<seg id="8">The best example of this is cooking in a pressure cooker.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially for cooking dietary foods such as vegetables, it is necessary to wash the vegetables well first, and then it is necessary to put them into a strainer and wait for the water to strain.</seg>
<seg id="10">One-third of a deep cooking pot is filled with water and a steam strainer is placed inside the pot.</seg>
<seg id="11">The mouth of the cooking pot is half closed.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this way, we allow steam to escape from the cooking pot.</seg>
<seg id="13">Firstly the heat of the oven is set to the highest degree and the water is boiled; after the temperature is fixed by setting the heat in the oven to a lower degree.</seg>
<seg id="14">The vegetables and food are steam cooked for 10-15 minutes and are then checked with the help of a fork once they are cooked.</seg>
<seg id="15">The cooked vegetables are removed from the oven and served on plates.</seg>
<seg id="16">Appearance, colour and aroma of the food do not change with the steam cooking technique; therefore this is a healthy method.</seg>
<seg id="17">The distinctive taste of the food stays the same.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore the quality and flavour of the food are not spoiled.</seg>
<seg id="19">Loss of nutrition is kept to a minimum in steam cooking, which is also the most economical way of cooking.</seg>
<seg id="20">Steamed vegetables offer a satisfactory flavour for the diner with their fresh and vibrant appearance.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frequently used, especially as part of a diet, this method is often preferred also because it is very light.</seg>

<seg id="1">David Bowie - Blackstar: The alien's "last album"</seg>
<seg id="2">Knowing that you will die; producing that final album without telling anyone; making your deathbed an artistic expression in the music video you shot...</seg>
<seg id="3">These kinds of actions may seem "extreme" to us mortal earthlings.</seg>
<seg id="4">I say mortal earthlings because I am among those who believe that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.</seg>
<seg id="5">He came to our world from some corner of the universe; now he has returned to his motherland; which is just how it goes.</seg>
<seg id="6">He came because it was necessary to inspire not only Kiss, Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga, but also all the singers of the world.</seg>
<seg id="7">He fulfilled his duty with success.</seg>
<seg id="8">David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price: 9.99 TL 5/5</seg>
<seg id="9">Maybe he was nourished by Warhol and Kubrick from the same planet as him.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Apollo 11 landed on earth, he decided to say "this is nothing, I am an alien", and he joined us by singing "Space Oddity".</seg>
<seg id="11">Actually he did not join us; he was always ahead of us.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thanks to him, many people found their way.</seg>
<seg id="13">Both musicians and listeners...</seg>
<seg id="14">If we leave aside his interest in plastic arts, his acting etc., it would be wrong to say that his music was "just music".</seg>
<seg id="15">The characters he created by himself, travelling from song to song, his references, innovation, taboo-breaking behaviour and discography reflect an artistic integrity for me.</seg>
<seg id="16">I can remember him neither as the father of glam rock, nor as the cousin of punk...</seg>
<seg id="17">If I remember him like that, what will happen to his avant-garde and electronic works, and to jazz, which he kept as an internal love since his childhood?</seg>
<seg id="18">David Bowie always reminded us what the expression "icon" means, up until that time when the word spread like wildfire.</seg>
<seg id="19">He was not a man; he was not a woman; he was not "human".</seg>
<seg id="20">He was a body.</seg>
<seg id="21">It seemed to us that he was on a mission.</seg>
<seg id="22">That body left this world two days after the release of his 26th studio album "Blackstar".</seg>
<seg id="23">He tried to prepare us for the fact that he would leave with "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", which we had listened to before the release of the album.</seg>
<seg id="24">We thought that "he has gotten old now, so he talks about death", but he was aware of everything.</seg>
<seg id="25">One more final hand...</seg>
<seg id="26">We can say that there are four songs that we already knew when the album was released; "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", shouldering the burden of message and emotion, "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)" and "Tis A Pity She Was A Whore", previously released but re-recorded for this album.</seg>
<seg id="27">I would add that the remaining songs, "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days", are also very good.</seg>
<seg id="28">When we look at "Blackstar" as a whole, it was created on a very strong musical structure, but it feels like it was produced with sincere and instantaneous feelings as well.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is an album neither of death nor a "reckoning with the past"...</seg>
<seg id="30">It is just a real "final" album.</seg>
<seg id="31">"The End" caption of a life in music, which is a masterpiece in its entirety.</seg>

<seg id="7">The Chamber of Merchants' union decided on this price 2 years ago.</seg>

<seg id="11">In other regions, it was already being sold for 1 TL.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to use the mid-term break?</seg>
<seg id="2">How should students use the mid-term break? - we asked this question to educational specialist and student coach, Murat Aydın.</seg>
<seg id="3">Students should not only think of mid-term break as spending time resting, entertaining and watching television.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mid-term break is an important opportunity to get ready for the new school term and to review last term.</seg>
<seg id="5">Being free time, the mid-term break is also a good opportunity for personality development, acquisition of knowledge and skills, and taking up a new hobby.</seg>
<seg id="6">Make a list of what to do during the term.</seg>
<seg id="7">Write down everything you plan to do, and try to put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="8">You can be sure that you will benefit from this and have a more efficient term.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now, firstly, let's talk about how efficient the term should be for students preparing for the YGS-LYS exams.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the most common questions coming from the students preparing for YGS-LYS are as follows: "How should we use this time, should we solve a lot of questions or finish incomplete subjects?"</seg>
<seg id="11">Firstly, lets introduce our article with both the answers to these questions and some advice to those who are preparing for the exam in order to spend the time efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the preparation period for the exams should be a process that starts from the 9th grade, under normal conditions, we are trying instead to complete it in the final 1 year; this obliges us to spend our last year more effectively, by using our time more efficiently and properly.</seg>
<seg id="13">A final grade student must deal with both the exam preparation and preparation for school written exams at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if the graduate students have finished school and experienced the exam (YGS-LYS) at least once, the year they prepare for the exam again as a graduate student is critically important for them as well.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because most graduate students and their families see "that" year as a last chance, which creates greater stress.</seg>
<seg id="16">Revision is the study that students do not like; they do it because they feel obliged to do it; and therefore they always postpone it to the last moment; but it becomes completely a duty for the students that do it regularly and make it a habit; and there is always a plan for what and when things need to be done.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now we have a mid-term break ahead of us and we have to use it in the best way possible.</seg>
<seg id="18">To do this, we should always have a plan that allows us to manage our time well.</seg>
<seg id="19">Studying for Lessons during mid-term break:</seg>
<seg id="20">Firstly, everyone should make a plan suitable to their situation.</seg>
<seg id="21">1. They should include what they have covered, what are the incomplete subjects in their plan and they should plan their days, weeks and 15-day periods.</seg>
<seg id="22">There should be both lesson revision and question solving in this period.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the meantime, students that do not have any incomplete subjects can solve 1 or 2 mock exams on average.</seg>
<seg id="24">Deal with Your Incomplete Subjects: Studies show that people forget 75 percent of what they learn in a week, 66 percent in a day, and 54 percent in an hour.</seg>
<seg id="25">The best and most effective method of eliminating this tendency to forget is by doing revision.</seg>
<seg id="26">Especially students who make too many errors in prior lessons should concentrate on studying with general revision.</seg>
<seg id="27">Firstly, determine what are the incomplete subjects and make your plan everyday; choose one lesson everyday and completely deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="28">This planning will help you in both academic and psychological situations.</seg>
<seg id="29">When adding subjects to your plan, pay attention to the subjects you make the most errors in.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because there will be no long holiday periods in the future.</seg>
<seg id="31">Solve Questions:</seg>
<seg id="32">Question solving is as important as revising lessons.</seg>
<seg id="33">Because we can see how much we understand the subjects we study only through the feedback from the questions we solve.</seg>
<seg id="34">Do not forget to select a number of questions to be solved each day.</seg>
<seg id="35">The number of questions you solve may change in line with what you study; you may not solve many questions on a day that you mostly study lessons, but we should still solve questions to a certain extent, at least in order to see how much we learned from the lesson of that day.</seg>
<seg id="36">Solve Mock Exams:</seg>
<seg id="37">Another area of study to look into during mid-term break should be solving mock exams.</seg>
<seg id="38">Even if all the subjects are not finished, you can solve mock exams at least for each lesson.</seg>
<seg id="39">Supposing that you finished a Turkish lesson, you can solve a 40-question mock exam of Turkish.</seg>
<seg id="40">You should definitely keep track of time while doing this.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you solve 40 Turkish questions in 60 minutes, your next target should be to complete it several minutes faster.</seg>
<seg id="42">Vacation and Hobby Plans:</seg>
<seg id="43">Of course, a break does not only mean studying for lessons, you should spare a few days for vacation, to rest and spend time on your hobbies.</seg>
<seg id="44">A holiday period spent only studying for lessons will stop you from having fun and relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="45">For this reason, there should be special time set aside for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="46">Reading books, watching television or surfing the internet may be in your plans, but the most important thing is how much time you spare for each activity.</seg>
<seg id="47">I have some advice for those who say that I could not spend the first term efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="48">If you can say that I could not spend the first term well, I could not study much and I missed many lessons, this mid-term break is a big opportunity for you as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">Nevertheless, you should firstly decide on and believe this.</seg>
<seg id="50">Most of the goals in the 2009-2010 Turkish Super League were scored between minutes 76 and 90.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now, answer the question you ask; do you go to the locker room after the end of the match or is the match still continuing and is there enough time for you to score a goal?</seg>
<seg id="52">I suppose that no one wants to say, "we will look forward to our next match", a conventional expression used by the coach or players of a losing football team.</seg>
<seg id="53">Now, the only thing you should do is look forward and let go of the past, and run instead of walking.</seg>
<seg id="54">To summarize what we said:</seg>
<seg id="55">1) Firstly make a mid-term break plan,</seg>
<seg id="56">2) Revise the lessons you know,</seg>
<seg id="57">3) Finish any incomplete subjects,</seg>
<seg id="58">4) Consolidate what you have learned by solving questions,</seg>
<seg id="59">5) Solve mock exams,</seg>
<seg id="60">6) Read books,</seg>
<seg id="61">7) Determine new goals for next term,</seg>
<seg id="62">8) Spare time for you, your hobbies and the things you enjoy,</seg>
<seg id="63">9) Spare time for your family and your friends,</seg>
<seg id="64">10) Spare time for social and cultural activities (cinema, sport, theatre, concert, travel, picnics, etc.)</seg>

<seg id="2">The founder of Kervan, one of the biggest "home" chain stores in Turkey with 45 stores of 1000 square meters on average, Şinasi Demirel and his son Hasan have now incorporated Home Sweet Home, which has 17 stores abroad and 25 stores here in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="3">With the recent completion of trade registry procedures, Kervan is now the owner of 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.</seg>
<seg id="4">Stating that there are still no Kervan stores abroad, Şinasi Demirel said, "From now on, we will continue with big retailing with Kervan and smaller retailing with Home Sweet Home."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Kervan will also expand abroad".</seg>
<seg id="6">A retail chain and producer with a turnover of 140 million Turkish Lira was created with the merger of Home Sweet Home, with a 50 million Turkish Lira turnover, and Kervan, with a 90 million Turkish Lira turnover in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="7">Kervan's total retail area, with 45 stores in 35 provinces, is 45 thousand square metres.</seg>
<seg id="8">25 of the stores belong to the parent company.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are around 500 people employed by Kervan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Home Sweet Home has 25 stores in Turkey and 17 stores abroad, its total retail area is 6500 square metres, and its number of employees is around 320.</seg>
<seg id="11">Carrying out production, export and retailing with his partner Alev Pakten, Home Sweet Home's Chairman, Kadir Kalaycıoğlu stated that they are very happy with the merger with Kervan and added, "We are from Mardin and entered this sector in 1998."</seg>
<seg id="12">From the very beginning, we created a brand with the support of Mr. Şinasi.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Şinasi is like the "TRT" of this sector.</seg>
<seg id="14">We learned a lot from him as well.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, we took our first steps in retail when he gave us his store in Akmerkez.</seg>
<seg id="16">In fact, we were working with Kervan as a strategical partner, not a rival.</seg>
<seg id="17">"From now on, a very important synergy will emerge with this merger."</seg>
<seg id="18">Kalaycıoğlu explained that there are 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad, most of which are in the Middle East; and they started exports to China last month.</seg>
<seg id="19">Kalaycıoğlu said, "We opened our first corner in Shanghai."</seg>
<seg id="20">We agreed with a chain store which has 200 stores.</seg>

<seg id="1">Yıldız Holding becomes Pladis abroad</seg>
<seg id="2">Yıldız Holding combined all the acquired global companies, active in the biscuit and chocolate sectors, under the name "Pladis".</seg>
<seg id="3">With the merger combining the brands De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and Ülker, a new food giant worth 5.2 billion dollars was born, in which 26 thousand employees work.</seg>
<seg id="4">Speaking at a meeting related to the merger of the global companies within Yıldız Holding, Murat Ülker, Yıldız Holding's Chairman, said, "To be a global company was our target from the beginning" and added:</seg>
<seg id="5">Murat Ülker broadcast the 335 million Turkish lira sale live on Periscope</seg>
<seg id="6">Founded 72 years ago, this company is now proceeding under the name "Yıldız Holding" and becoming a global brand, a global company around the world in the business of biscuits, chocolate and confectionery.</seg>
<seg id="7">In this period, we have advanced in various branches of the industry from retailing to packaging, from real estate to personal care in addition to biscuits, chocolate and confectionery.</seg>
<seg id="8">We are in thousands of sales points with 77 factories and 300 brands, which are active in 14 countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Stating that all of Yıldız Holding has created a "family of more than 50 thousand people", Ülker said, "Now, when we look at the possibilities of our family, we want to go back and focus on biscuits, chocolate and confectionery, namely our main business; we are getting reorganized for this", and he talked about the new structuring as follows:</seg>
<seg id="10">Life story of the father of Ülker, Mr. Sabri</seg>
<seg id="11">We are now re-evaluating our company structure and getting reorganized.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have divided the world into regions.</seg>
<seg id="13">And we distributed these regions to our CEOs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mehmet, Mohammed and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mehmet Tütüncü is responsible for Turkey, the Middle East, North Africa and Turkic Republics.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mohamed Elsarky is responsible for the continent of America and Japan, in addition to our Godiva business.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jeff van der Eems will be responsible for the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="18">While Ali Ülker, who I can say is a quality and innovation guru, undertakes a global responsibility in his area, Cem Karakaş will help me in the administration of the job.</seg>
<seg id="19">China, Russia and part of South-East Asia will be the regions we will establish and develop.</seg>
<seg id="20">Murat Ülker sold a share in SAF Real Estate Investment Trust</seg>
<seg id="21">He continued, "We are promising happiness to the whole world in every bite", Murat Ülker said, "The name of our global firm is Pladis, which we established to make this promise real."</seg>
<seg id="22">He said, "If you ask from where the name Pladis comes, actually the name has no special meaning" and added:</seg>
<seg id="23">Aztecs called it Maya.</seg>
<seg id="24">Japanese people, Subaru, Pervin in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="25">Süreyya in Arabic; we gained inspiration from the name of the star cluster, Pleiades, which is made up of seven stars and means Ülker in Latin.</seg>
<seg id="26">And so, we translated Ülker globally.</seg>
<seg id="27">Vice Chairman of the Board of Yıldız Holding, Ali Ülker, underlined that they "started to create a synergy in innovation" by collaborating with laboratories in different countries, and added:</seg>
<seg id="28">We have very valuable R&D teams; we gained certain synergies so far from the work on the R&D platform by gathering these teams together.</seg>
<seg id="29">We have 27 R&D centres under Pladis.</seg>
<seg id="30">The biggest ones are in the United Kingdom and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="31">More than 300 R&D specialists are working here.</seg>
<seg id="32">Synergy projects have already started to produce results.</seg>
<seg id="33">Produced by Ülker with export to United Kingdom due to start, Digestive balls (Nibbles) are produced in the chocolate factory of Ülker in Silivri.</seg>
<seg id="34">Another example of synergy: Ülker Krispi Tırtıklı, which are the same products but with different brands.</seg>
<seg id="35">By adapting cracker technology developed in the United Kingdom, namely the product Jacob's Crinklys, into Turkey in a short time, we brought the pleasant taste to Turkey under the name Ülker Krispi Tırtıklı.</seg>
<seg id="36">Very well known by everyone, Laviva was introduced to consumers in the U.S. today.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was elected as the general president again in the regular congress.</seg>
<seg id="3">Receiving the votes of 990 delegates out of 1238, Kılıçdaroğlu became general president again.</seg>
<seg id="4">248 of the votes cast were declared null and void.</seg>
<seg id="5">Party members cheered after the results were announced.</seg>
<seg id="6">CHP had 1275 delegates in total.</seg>
<seg id="7">The congress finished its endeavours and gathered at 10:00am on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the congress, Kılıçdaroğlu stated the following in his summary:</seg>
<seg id="9">We would have liked people to dance and sing folk songs here.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, where we stand now is underwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reality is that Turkey could not be governed.</seg>
<seg id="12">The resulting atmosphere overshadows all of that.</seg>
<seg id="13">The cause of the pessimism is those who are governing the country.</seg>
<seg id="14">As a member of CHP, we are against terror no matter where it comes from.</seg>
<seg id="15">Terror is a crime against humanity and the terrorists should not be forgiven.</seg>
<seg id="16">The fight against terrorism is carried out with intelligence, knowledge and comprehension.</seg>
<seg id="17">We certainly want to fight against it, and we want everybody to be untouched.</seg>
<seg id="18">What is the difference between the photographs from the Southeast and the photographs from Syria and Lebanon?</seg>
<seg id="19">When they came to the table, they made serious mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="20">The government is responsible for all the bloodshed, tears and victims.</seg>
<seg id="21">They took over this country with zero terrorism in 2002, but today Turkey has turned into a bloodbath.</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is responsible for them?</seg>
<seg id="23">The taxi driver Şehmuz in Diyarbakır?</seg>
<seg id="24">For what does Turkey pay the price?</seg>
<seg id="25">We will participate genuinely in the meetings to change the coup d'etat laws, we will offer our opinions.</seg>
<seg id="26">We won't let anybody build a country on their personal views.</seg>
<seg id="27">I say, "Let's change the pro-coup mindset".</seg>
<seg id="28">The houses of this country's intellectuals are raided and they are taken into custody because they gave their opinion.</seg>
<seg id="29">There are parts of what they say we do not agree with, but people should be able to offer their opinions freely.</seg>
<seg id="30">This tinpot dictator says, "Those who benefit from the state, treat it as an enemy".</seg>
<seg id="31">I would also like to ask him; those who benefit from the state, and use all the opportunities of the state, why don't they think about it when they rob the country?</seg>
<seg id="32">CHP is the party that brought the biggest changes to this country.</seg>
<seg id="33">We will make preparations together for the fourth biggest revolution.</seg>
<seg id="34">We will definitely bring libertarian democracy to this country no matter what it costs.</seg>
<seg id="35">They may detain us, they may take us into custody; CHP will bring freedom to this country no matter what they do, no matter how heavy the price.</seg>
<seg id="36">I'm making a clear, straight call to you, Davutoğlu.</seg>
<seg id="37">Do not hide behind the coup d'etat laws, those who hide behind them do not banish from one's mind the coup mentality.</seg>
<seg id="38">You gave a meritorious service medal to someone who gave a warning to you.</seg>
<seg id="39">Which coup are you talking about?</seg>
<seg id="40">It is completely aimed at deceiving the people.</seg>
<seg id="41">Party officials listed the other 3 revolutions as follows: the 1st big revolution is the foundation of the Republic by putting an end to the sultanate; the 2nd big revolution is the passing from the single party era to the multi-party era in the time of İnönü; the 3rd big revolution is passing into social democracy with Bülent Ecevit...</seg>
<seg id="42">There are qualifications and duties of the President.</seg>
<seg id="43">There is a President's oath in article 103.</seg>
<seg id="44">We know how important the concepts of honesty and honour are in this society.</seg>
<seg id="45">If someone comes out and gives this promise, they should keep their word to the death.</seg>
<seg id="46">Because honesty and honour are indisputable for us.</seg>
<seg id="47">What do honesty and honour mean for you, tinpot dictator?</seg>
<seg id="48">What do you understand from honesty and honour, why did you take this oath?</seg>
<seg id="49">What do honesty and honour mean to you?</seg>
<seg id="50">I want to learn this.</seg>
<seg id="51">The concepts of honesty and honour are held in high esteem by religious people.</seg>
<seg id="52">Their intention is not to abolish the law of the coup, but to fortify the law of the coup.</seg>
<seg id="53">It does not suffice and they want the presidential system.</seg>
<seg id="54">What kind of presidency; it is a presidential system with a boss.</seg>
<seg id="55">Why do you reject the Ottoman parliamentary system?</seg>
<seg id="56">One person commands and everybody does what is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="57">Do we have a healthy parliament in Turkey that works?</seg>
<seg id="58">No, it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="59">If we bring libertarian democracy, the system will work.</seg>
<seg id="60">They repeatedly say coup but they are strengthening the law of the coup.</seg>
<seg id="61">Declaring his nomination for candidacy of the general presidency, İzmir Deputy Mustafa Balbay could not join the race because he could not gather the signatures of 128 delegates necessary for the candidacy.</seg>
<seg id="62">Gathering 92 signatures, Balbay said, "I am not able to become a candidate under present conditions".</seg>
<seg id="63">The thing that attracted attention was that the previous CHP leader Deniz Baykal sat in the tribunes with party members instead of the seats allocated to deputies and members of the party council (PM), the central executive board (MYK) and honorary board.</seg>
<seg id="64">Istanbul deputy Gülay Yedekçi arrived early and sat near the section allocated to the General President Kılıçdaroğlu instead of sitting in the area allocated to the deputies.</seg>
<seg id="65">One of the things most spoken about in the backstage of the congress was the conversation between Klıçdaroğlu and the Yalova deputy Muharrem İnce.</seg>
<seg id="66">İnce explained that membership of the party council was offered to him, but he did not accept it.</seg>
<seg id="67">However, sources from central office claim that the meeting request came from İnce and membership of the party council was not offered to him.</seg>
<seg id="68">Ince shared a message on Twitter, "No matter who they are, the sources from the central office can get the details of the conversation from the Istanbul deputy Ali Özcan".</seg>
<seg id="69">Özcan said, "How can I know about the conversation between two people."</seg>
<seg id="70">He only said, "he went and spoke with him".</seg>
<seg id="71">Kılıçdaroğlu's son applauded his "father" repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id="72">The backstage of the party council left its mark on the first day of the ordinary "Congress of Democracy, Change and Brotherhood".</seg>
<seg id="73">After his speech at the congress, Kılıçdaroğlu went to his home and started to work on the list of party council.</seg>
<seg id="74">It was understood that while preparing the key list of 100 people, he called the 13 central executive board (MYK) members and said he would include them in the list; except for the current central executive board members Yakup Akkaya, Sencer Ayata and Ercan Karakaş, who declared that they did not want to be on the executive and did not apply for the party council (PM), and Seyhan Erdoğdu, who applied once more to the party council.</seg>
<seg id="75">It is stated that Kılıçdaroğlu may refer to another narrow list in addition to the 100 person-key list of the party council.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the 21 article-final declaration, accepted unanimously at the CHP congress, the abolishment of the annotation on the European Charter of Local Self-Government was requested, which was brought into the agenda with the self government discussions of DTK, and the increase of the authority share in the local affairs.</seg>
<seg id="77">Incleded in the declaration were the aims of "ending of the party state system" and "establishment of a transparent and accountable rule of law".</seg>
<seg id="78">Vice Chairman of the AK Party Selçuk Özdağ, İdris Baluken from HDP and Ruhsar Demirel from MHP watched the congress.</seg>
<seg id="79">AK Party member Özdağ and the delegation from the AK Party left the hall when Kılıçdaroğlu harshly criticized President Erdoğan.</seg>
<seg id="80">Özdağ said, "I saw that he knows no boundaries of criticizing, it was not possible for me to accept it".</seg>
<seg id="81">The banner with photos of the arrested journalists Can Dündar and Erdem Gül and the text "If I don't burn, if you don't burn, if we don't burn, how will the light vanquish the darkness?", and the banner of "Peace" in English, Turkish and Kurdish attracted attention in the hall.</seg>
<seg id="82">The congress started in the morning with the songs of Group Yorum and Ahmet Kaya.</seg>
<seg id="83">There was big applause for the message sent by Türkan Elçi, wife of the Bar president of Diyarbakır Tahir Elçi, who was killed in an armed assault.</seg>
<seg id="84">Berkin Elvan's mother Gülsüm and father Sami Elvan also participated in the congress.</seg>
</p>

<doc sysid="ref" docid="hurriyet.com.tr.2817" genre="news" origlang="tr">
<p>
<seg id="1">The most applauded part of the speech was the part in which Kılıçdaroğlu said that they will embrace democracy "to the death" no matter what price they have to pay.</seg>
<seg id="2">Having assembled 34 ordinary and 18 extraordinary congresses, 52 congresses in total until now, CHP assembled the 53rd big congress in Ankara Arena yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Participation was high.</seg>
<seg id="4">There were more than 15 thousand CHP members in the hall with a capacity of 12 thousand seats.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the crowd didn't do justice to this number with their enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most exciting moment was the moment in which Kılıçdaroğlu entered the hall with his wife Selvi Kılıçdaroğlu.</seg>
<seg id="7">The excitement continued when the Kılıçdaroğlu couple greeted the hall with a wave.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is no trace of the discipline seen in the congresses of the AK Party.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was a lot of movement in the ground area of the arena even when Kılıçdaroğlu was making speech.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was obvious that the CHP members, wanting to enter the Party Council, preferred to seek support by talking about themselves to party executives and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the CHP executives tried to explain that this situation was not a bad thing by saying, "It is better than sitting down without moving and lining up the walk-on party members as in the party meetings of Korea or the Soviet Union".</seg>
<seg id="12">The CHP congress has one more difference from the congresses of the AK Party or MHP.</seg>
<seg id="13">In these parties, only the general president talks.</seg>
<seg id="14">In CHP, the congress becomes a platform in which the problems of the party are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="15">When the number of party members wanting to speak increased, Council Chairman Murat Karayalçın had difficulty in adjusting the time.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was the expression "The homeland goes bad" in their faces, and there was a distance to the comments "You will then change this course of events with the result coming from this hall".</seg>
<seg id="17">All the CHP members said, "Something should be done", but there wasn't a strong and coherent answer to the question of "What should be done".</seg>
<seg id="18">The fact that there will be no election in the next 4 years had a big effect on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="19">When Kılıçdaroğlu went up to the rostrum, we journalists waited for his answer to the question "What should be done".</seg>
<seg id="20">Firstly, Kılıçdaroğlu answered the question "what is going on".</seg>
<seg id="21">He highlighted the issue of the arrested journalists, what was done to academics because of the declaration, what took place in the southeast, the deadlock that foreign policy has come to.</seg>
<seg id="22">He repeatedly answered the "Legends of Anatolia" issue related to his CHP party, such as, "it is a party of non-believers", "it supports coups d'état" and "it is the party of elitists".</seg>
<seg id="23">When it comes to the "What should be done" stage, he tried to put forward a "strategy" rather than discussing concrete steps.</seg>
<seg id="24">He stressed that all of these problems could be overcome with a stronger democracy and more justice.</seg>
<seg id="25">He gave a promise on behalf of CHP and said, "We will work no matter what it costs until we bring democracy."</seg>
<seg id="26">"We will struggle to the death for democracy".</seg>
<seg id="27">One last note: it is necessary to remember that CHP have solved the issue of "organization" as of the 53rd congress, and it now succeeds in assembling a congress without problem.</seg>
<seg id="28">On another note, cards were printed for 900 journalists said to be attending the congress, but journalist participation in the hall was not at that level.</seg>
<seg id="29">Representatives of media organizations from Ankara were not as eager as they were for the congresses of the AK Party.</seg>

<seg id="2">The new operating system can be requested by heading to the Settings app, tapping "General," and then selecting "Software Update."</seg>
<seg id="3">If it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some have run into problems after that installation, being hit by an error message telling them that "Software update failed."</seg>
<seg id="5">To get around that, users are recommended either to wait for the rush to die down, or to try and upgrade through iTunes.</seg>
<seg id="6">The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.</seg>
<seg id="7">That might include deleting apps to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by slimming down the update, and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest apps to delete and then re-install them once the process is over.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a charger while the update happens, so that it doesn't run out of battery.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the charge is too low, Apple won't let the update go ahead, since the phone dying halfway through could lead to the update breaking.</seg>

<seg id="1">FedEx earnings mixed, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx reported disappointing results for its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground division.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="4">At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday's opening bell.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said that it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, down 20 cents from an earlier prediction.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.</seg>
<seg id="8">The reduced outlook comes despite rate hikes averaging 4.9 percent, which will take effect Jan. 4, and higher surcharges for ground shipment of heavy or large packages, which begin in November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and growth in online commerce.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was "performing solidly given weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."</seg>
<seg id="11">The holiday-hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said that that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same that it hired last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter that ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share amounted to $2.42, short of the $2.44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Revenue rose 5 percent, to $12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shipping, which has caused revenue in its Express unit to stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the latest quarter, ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates, while income fell in the freight business on higher labor costs.</seg>
<seg id="20">In premarket trading about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares were down $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.</seg>
<seg id="21">They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.</seg>

<seg id="1">At their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table deciding if it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">Looming over them at one end of the central bank's ornate, two-story boardroom will be a mural of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests above all others.</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank has a dual charge from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there's an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And that third mandate could be the X-factor in a too-close-to-predict decision, to be announced Thursday, about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being weaned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even though most data show the economy growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-cautious Fed officials skittish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and foremost the most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with justification to wait further," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There's no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing financial market jitters.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">Financial markets, however, are expecting the Fed to hold off, with a key indicator showing only about a 30% chance of a boost.</seg>
<seg id="13">That would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate, unless policymakers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers will hold the rate steady this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point in time," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If Fed policymakers did, "they would have to go to great lengths in their policy statement to hold financial markets' hands so they don't panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would validate the strength of the U.S. recovery.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been solid this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage gains have shown signs of picking up.</seg>
<seg id="24">And although inflation continued to run below the central bank's annual 2% target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But financial markets around the world started convulsing late last month after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% from the May high.</seg>
<seg id="29">For Fed policymakers, the market turmoil adds to the complex calculus of when to raise the interest rate.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Absent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks, they would be tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy are going to be, and they have almost no data to rely on that post-dates the developments in China," Oliner said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the global economy isn't one of the Fed's primary concerns, so technically it shouldn't be factored into its decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But, in effect, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere hint by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "taper" its monetary expansion triggered market convulsions around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Its decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth-management firm Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that seem unconnected to economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase, cited decisions in 1998-99 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point over three meetings "despite limited identifiable implications for U.S. growth," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market meltdown, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latest turmoil doesn't come close to that level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"You certainly don't want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think they should get ahead of the curve.</seg>

<seg id="2">Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while breastfeeding, by featuring images of babies suckling from breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy food.</seg>
<seg id="3">Human breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to grow a strong immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Due to excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new moms are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, new research suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tumors.</seg>
<seg id="7">Unfortunately, unhealthy diets were found to negatively affect the child's immune system.</seg>

<seg id="7">Sam Wood is keeping his lips firmly sealed until Thursday's finale</seg>
<seg id="8">All three women waxed lyrical over why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons they would each love to be his partner.</seg>
<seg id="9">However when asked the question, "If not you, who should get Wood's final rose?," their answers could have provided a spoiler as to who won the Bachelors heart.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jarryd Hayne had several options of where to begin his NFL career.</seg>
<seg id="2">Detroit and Seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it's looking like a wise decision.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some coaches would have benched Hayne for the rest of the game for losing a fumble like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return in Tuesday's 20-3 win against Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Tomsula showed faith in his man, giving Hayne the next opportunity to return a punt and including him in the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tomsula continued to show his true colours in the locker room after the game.</seg>
<seg id="7">Instead of chewing out his rookies in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tomsula also backed Hayne publicly in his post-match press conference.</seg>
<seg id="9">49ers beat reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from special teams co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jarryd Hayne fumbles a punt that was recovered by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter</seg>
<seg id="11">It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hayne was seen cursing as he made his way from the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It was just one of those things, you just worry about the next play and that's it," said Hayne.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-goal led to a Queensland try.</seg>
<seg id="15">Overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27-year-old.</seg>

<seg id="2">Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.</seg>
<seg id="6">Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death toll.</seg>
<seg id="8">The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would dilute their political influence.</seg>
<seg id="9">There have also been protests in western Nepal from ethnic Tharus who want their own state.</seg>
<seg id="10">At least 40 people, including 11 police officials, have been killed in violent clashes since Aug.</seg>
<seg id="11">10, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.</seg>
<seg id="13">Lawmakers have been voting on clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said that the new charter could be enacted by Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="1">For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's still to early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments, however.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data take a long time to show up," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight loss operations, or bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, bariatric surgeries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies were done in people who are morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the BMI among those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those who had surgery, diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and partially in 28 percent.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medically-treated group, by comparison, diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.</seg>
<seg id="19">After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medical therapy group, however, it remained steady at about 8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected by the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce the mortality rate at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), achieved larger drops in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and in hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent vs 16.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Though the new study didn't show a benefit in survival among surgery patients, Blackstone said it's reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is where this paper is critical, because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BMI group," with no increased risk of death or renal disease, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that once they've accumulated these genetic changes that hardwired their bodies into obesity and diabetes, reversing that is really hard.</seg>

<seg id="1">"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News</seg>
<seg id="2">Europe could not host all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees" home countries.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="5">He claimed that, under current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of single nations or even continents.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also stressed that, however admirable, the West-European countries" response to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It it's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">"So taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring genuine peace and genuine development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">We have to reduce the use of force.</seg>
<seg id="12">The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.</seg>
<seg id="13">Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US" violent response engendered a chain of uncontrollable events.</seg>
<seg id="14">After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-violence.</seg>
<seg id="15">I know his motives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fourfold increase in children ingesting hand sanitizer in last 4 years</seg>
<seg id="2">Poison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent uptick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing highly-alcoholic hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, hand sanitizer ingestion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Kids are getting into these products more frequently, and unfortunately, there's a percentage of them going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said some kids are drinking sanitizer intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or on a social-media dare.</seg>
<seg id="6">Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking sanitizer for a cheap buzz.</seg>
<seg id="7">Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-containing mouthwash for a stiffer drink.</seg>
<seg id="8">Younger children can be drawn to attractive sanitizer scents.</seg>
<seg id="9">"A kid is not thinking this is bad for them," Lopez said.</seg>
<seg id="10">A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">In young children, especially, only a few squirts can cause alcohol poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.</seg>
<seg id="15">So you wouldn't leave a shot of whiskey sitting around, but people will have these hand sanitizers out and if kids get into it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested as many as four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her blood-alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nhaijah was slurring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could have been very lethal for my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or sanitizing wipes short of moving hand sanitizer out of a child's reach.</seg>
<seg id="23">Beyond alcohol poisoning, some sanitizers have been linked to deaths.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="25">Health officials surmised that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York plotted to poison their "mean" teacher "by putting antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.</seg>
<seg id="27">The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room.</seg>
<seg id="28">Police considered the foiled plan to be "idle chatter," referring discipline to the school district.</seg>

<seg id="17">Because "Aysel" (Zeynep Kankonde), the prattling, gullible cleaner and next-door neighbour, and "Perran" (Şebnem Sönmez), the mysterious woman in the opposite flat, draw her into conversation.</seg>
<seg id="18">They approach the situation as if it were a normal, ordinary situation.</seg>
<seg id="19">The woman becomes more stressed; she could not concentrate and jump.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the famous singer "Meltem Kaya" (İpek Türktan Kaynak), who is having her home cleaned, joins the conversation between the three, the situation turns into a clamour of voices.</seg>
<seg id="21">Approaching the situation with her naive and sincere style, "Meltem" cannot help but sing when she sees a crowd.</seg>
<seg id="22">This interesting attempt at suicide takes on a different dimension with the appearance of real estate agent "Murat" (Kadir Çermik) with a spare key.</seg>
<seg id="23">The situation gets out of hand when the singer "Meltem" gives very inaccurate information to the press.</seg>
<seg id="24">The song "Sokak Kızı" by Nazan Öncel is also used in the play.</seg>
<seg id="25">COMEDY OF DEPRESSION</seg>
<seg id="26">Directing on the stage for the first time, Uçer was successful in ensuring the tempo and flow of the play.</seg>
<seg id="27">Zeynep Kankonde and İpek Türktan Kaynak carry the burden of comedy in the play.</seg>
<seg id="28">The exaggerated characters played by this duo succeed in making the audience laugh with both their mimics and lines.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Şebnem Sönmez conveys her years of experience on the stage very well, Deniz Çakır delivers a persuasive performance in reflecting the depressed mood of "Ebru Uysal".</seg>
<seg id="30">Making an indelible impression with his performance in Tolga Çelik's award-winning film "Sarmaşık", Kadir Çermik successfully accompanies these four women.</seg>
<seg id="31">Defined as a comedy of depression, the one-act play promises to make you laugh without confusing the mind.</seg>
<seg id="32">Here is what stayed in my mind from these beautiful words mostly coming from the mouth of "Perran", played by Şebnem Sönmez: Do not scribble hastily, they will read it; do not live hastily, they will see you.</seg>
<seg id="33">Most children possibly thought of dying to punish their fathers and mothers, and they somehow ended up crying at the thought.</seg>
<seg id="34">The woman is hanging in the air like an unrealised joke.</seg>
<seg id="35">The woman searches for a funny story that she has always forgotten a part of.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, every story begins with a kind of being abandonment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I should put my hands into my pocket, I cannot stand anything without pockets.</seg>
<seg id="38">People do not know where to put their hands.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since we do not know it, our hands multiply.</seg>
<seg id="40">People badmouth what they do not know; they fabricate and fabricate.</seg>
<seg id="41">A misunderstanding becomes reality.</seg>
<seg id="42">All the women's heads are confused because they are messed up by someone.</seg>

<seg id="3">Mete Kalkavan will serve as the referee for the match which starts at 20:00 at the Başakşehir Fatih Terim Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="4">Winning the last 4 matches before the Super League's mid-season break, the white-black team wants to both increase its winning series to 5 matches and maintain its lead by beating Mersin İdman Yurdu in front of their supporters.</seg>
<seg id="5">Beşiktaş ended the first half of the season with 13 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses, and entered the mid-season break one point ahead of its closest rival in the rankings, Fenerbahçe, with a total of 41 points.</seg>
<seg id="6">Güneş with his ideal 11 on the pitch</seg>
<seg id="7">It is expected that Şenol Güneş, the manager of Beşiktaş, will send his ideal 11 onto the pitch against Mersin İdman Yurdu.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the Ziraat Turkish Cup during the mid-season break, facing off twice against 1461 Trabzon, one of the teams in the PTT 1st league, and picking different squads in these matches, the experienced manager will return to his ideal 11 in the Mersin İdmanyurdu match.</seg>
<seg id="9">While it is expected that İsmail Köybaşı, having been injured in the last match against the Black Sea representatives, will be assigned a place among the first 11, it was reported that Güneş plans to give Olcay Şahan his jersey in the midfield position.</seg>
<seg id="10">The possible 11</seg>
<seg id="11">The possible 11 of Beşiktaş is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="12">Tolga Zengin, Beck, Rhodolfo, Ersan Adem Gülüm, İsmail Köybaşı, Hutchinson, Quaresma, Oğuzhan, Sosa, Olcay Şahan, Gomez.</seg>
<seg id="13">3 footballers at the penalty limit</seg>
<seg id="14">3 footballers are at the penalty limit of yellow cards for Beşiktaş before the match against Mersin İdmanyurdu.</seg>
<seg id="15">If Mario Gomez, Luiz Rhodolfo or Andreas Beck, each with three yellow cards in the Super League, are shown a yellow card during the match against Mersin İdmanyurdu, they will not be able to play in the away match against Trabzonspor, to be played in the 19th week.</seg>
<seg id="16">Beşiktaş's trump card is Gomez</seg>
<seg id="17">All eyes will be on German footballer Mario Gomez in the match Beşiktaş will play against Mersin İdmanyurdu.</seg>
<seg id="18">Having scored against these opponents in the last 4 league matches wearing the white-black jersey, the 31 year-old footballer hit the top in the top scorers ranking with his performances.</seg>
<seg id="19">Having played in all the matches in the first half of the league and scoring in 10 of them, Gomez has 13 goals in the league.</seg>
<seg id="20">Meanwhile, Cenk Tosun, another Beşiktaş goal scorer, scored 3 goals in the away match against Mersin İdmanyurdu in the first half of the league, and completed his first hat-trick in his professional career.</seg>

<seg id="25">"Scoring" and "conceding" teams face off</seg>
<seg id="26">The match between Beşiktaş and Mersin İdmanyurdu will pit the highest scoring and the team that concedes most in this Super League season.</seg>
<seg id="27">Having scored 41 goals in the first half of the season, the white-blacks are in the position of the highest scoring team.</seg>
<seg id="28">Having conceded 36 goals in a 17 week-period, Mersin İdmanyurdu is one of two teams who concede most in the league alongside Eskişehirspor, sharing last place on the rankings table.</seg>
<seg id="29">Beşiktaş defeated its opponent 5-2 in the match between these two teams that was played in the first half of the season and witnessed 7 goals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Manager crisis in Mersin İdmanyurdu</seg>
<seg id="31">In the mid-season break there was a manager crisis experienced in Mersin İdmanyurdu, who couldn't finish the first half of the Super League in their desired position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Having finished the first half of the season under the management of Bülent Korkmaz, Mersin İdmanyurdu parted company with the 48 year-old manager on the first day of the start of camp.</seg>
<seg id="33">Brought in as head of the red-navy blues instead of Korkmaz, Hakan Kutlu remained as head of the team, which he had managed before, for only one day.</seg>
<seg id="34">An agreement was made with the manager Nurullah Sağlam after the Mersin İdmanyurdu general meeting, which held an extraordinary general meeting during the mid-season break and elected Hüseyin Çalışkan as the president; but the 50 year-old manager remained at the head of the team for only 2 days.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mesin İdmanyurdu will take to the field against Beşiktaş without a manager because they have not made an agreement with anyone after Nurullah Sağlam.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin eats his words</seg>
<seg id="2">While Russia is preparing to recognise the status of "able to do business with Russia" for Turkish companies if it cannot replace the services offered by Turkey, the head of the Russian Tour Operators Union stated, "Russian citizens do not give up on Turkey".</seg>
<seg id="3">Calculating that cutting current economic ties with Turkey will bring additional costs to Russia, the Ministry of Economic Development for Russia prepared a new "exceptional cases" bill for the Russian Government regarding Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the proposal, published in the Russian Federal Regulation, giving permission to Turkish companies and firms is allowed when it becomes necessary even in the area of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the proposal, goods and services from Turkish companies and firms will be used in cases where it is impossible to provide them from sources other than Turkey and domestic production in Russia brings serious additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="6">The committee formed within the Ministry of Economic Development for Russia with other related ministries will determine which services and goods of Turkish origin will be included in this category.</seg>
<seg id="7">Therefore, officials will select and decide which Turkish companies will be able to work with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Moreover, according to this document, state organizations and private companies in Russia will have to prove that there is no Russian equivalent for the business they will do with Turkish partners.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the case that the proposal is approved by the Russian government and takes effect, the preferred Turkish companies will be registered in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Russian Tour Operators Union expressed that Russian citizens have not given up on Turkey in the explanation it made yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="11">The explanation includes the following: "In spite of the ban on the sale of tours and the advice of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia to not go to Turkey, our citizens have started to search for ways to organize their holiday by themselves."</seg>
<seg id="12">The number of the posts titled "the most practical and the cheapest way to take a holiday in Turkey" keeps snowballing in social media on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="13">The most widespread advice is to make online hotel reservations and to fly with Turkish Airlines.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev defined the oil price falling under 30 dollars as a "dramatical development" from Russia's viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="15">Medvedev said, "Nobody thought that petroleum would fall under 30 dollars and it was also a big surprise for our government."</seg>
<seg id="16">He said, "At this rate, it seems impossible to implement the budget as is now".</seg>
<seg id="17">We passed the last month of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="18">After the shot-down plane crisis, Russian President Putin announces that economic sanctions will be intensified.</seg>
<seg id="19">In those days, our businessmen and our Turkish Airlines staff suffered a lot, trying to go to Russia in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="20">Obstacles are set for Turkish goods at customs, and they are subjected to unthinkable checks.</seg>
<seg id="21">1 month, not much, passes from then till now, and Nerdun Hacıoğlu reports from Moscow yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="22">One way or another, sanctions are being eased one by one.</seg>
<seg id="23">All right, but why?</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason is simple.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is because the closing of border crossings with the methods of a century ago and efforts to convert a political fight into an economic fight are no longer effective in an era when the economy has become so globalised.</seg>
<seg id="26">Look, we are continuing to write news about how the economic embargo implemented against Iran for many years was flouted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Russia and Turkey are countries that seem to have many allies but actually don't have so many, and they are dependent upon each other.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is not technically possible to separate the two countries in one night, connected through their businessmen, tourists, entrepreneurs and customers.</seg>
<seg id="29">If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter each other's countries from the chimney.</seg>
<seg id="30">The most correct way is to have political discussion and to make terms at the table before the sanctions create new Reza Zarrabs (Rıza Sarraf).</seg>

<seg id="7">It has sparked rumours of disharmony at Celtic, which was dismissed out of hand by Griffiths, who insisted he and his team-mates are not labouring under any sense of increased scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch League leaders.</seg>

<seg id="9">Lack of Scots title race bores Dutch - de Boer</seg>
<seg id="10">Former Rangers midfielder and ex-Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there's no title rivalry with Rangers.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they don't show highlights of the Celtic games any more and why?"</seg>
<seg id="12">It is because Rangers aren't there.</seg>
<seg id="13">People here don't only talk about Rangers coming back.</seg>

<seg id="18">RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic are struggling, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.</seg>
<seg id="19">Defeat to Malmo and subsequent Champions League exit was swiftly followed by losing to 10-man Aberdeen, who now sit five points clear at the top of the table.</seg>
<seg id="20">But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad periods before and we will come again."</seg>
<seg id="21">Now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible.</seg>

<seg id="28">The ex-Brentford gaffer said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."</seg>
<seg id="29">In terms of players coming in the summer, you have that pre-season period to bed them in, which you've seen with our own group this season.</seg>

<seg id="38">Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle</seg>
<seg id="39">The diehard Hibee was carpeted after admitting singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why I'm A Witness At An Execution In Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man being put to death.</seg>
<seg id="3">If it happens, and I hope it won't, I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation was first made back in January, via his best friend, and though I was shocked, I agreed.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the day approaches, I've come to dread it.</seg>
<seg id="7">So why do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would offer a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">True, journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Whoever is picked will watch it dispassionately.</seg>
<seg id="13">I cannot do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will be sitting alongside Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls, and one visit lasting two-and-a-half hours.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the guy.</seg>
<seg id="16">We often laugh a lot when we talk.</seg>
<seg id="17">The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I will just have to try to remember all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here's the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I complained to her.</seg>
<seg id="23">She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but still thinks I'm wrong to do what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip has taken issue with some of the things I've said and written.</seg>
<seg id="25">He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.</seg>
<seg id="26">I've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="28">If he dies, he thinks the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be alongside me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.</seg>
<seg id="31">I won't go over all the details again here.</seg>
<seg id="32">I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being an accessory after the fact.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And it's from this perspective that I will watch him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot claim to be truly objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will be other reporters you can turn to for that.</seg>
<seg id="40">What you will get from me is what it's like to watch a man I like die an unnecessary death.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Moody alleges stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing</seg>
<seg id="2">Peter Moody has alleged Racing Victoria stewards attempted to plant a spy in his stables last year and threatened to quit racing immediately.</seg>
<seg id="3">He took aim at stewards and Racing Victoria's integrity department, alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to Lidari's positive swab to cobalt, which he can not explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had bitten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn't want it "to look like sour grapes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so frustrated it all comes out at once," Moody said.</seg>
<seg id="7">They know it went on.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said.</seg>
<seg id="9">I will go home tonight and sleep well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">When they start to think I'm not that's when I shouldn't be a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would then have to consider what I do with my licence.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earlier, Moody had dropped the bombshell in a racing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my stables to offer information on what I was doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.</seg>
<seg id="15">They obviously believe I'm a cheat.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that's the case surely they should all hand in their briefs because they've been incompetent in trying to catch me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Should that make me think it's becoming personal?</seg>
<seg id="19">Has RVL got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry?</seg>
<seg id="20">Am I bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">Am I that bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe people out there think I am.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maybe they need to take my licence off me and push me away and I've got no doubt what I'm saying now might make them think about that.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I've got to the point now where I don't care and that saddens me.</seg>
<seg id="25">That really saddens me.</seg>
<seg id="26">I will put the pressure on them and onus on them to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I've got the support of my family and I can walk away.</seg>
<seg id="28">The trainer's frustration levels have built with the long-running cobalt inquiry involving Lidari and the late scratching had him saying that he could "throw my licence across the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Moody, best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black Caviar, labelled the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay poultice had been applied to the horses legs, which is against the rules.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's against the rules of racing.</seg>
<seg id="31">I've got to accept full responsibility for that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg.</seg>
<seg id="33">It could have had it last night.</seg>
<seg id="34">It could have had it yesterday, which it did have.</seg>
<seg id="35">It had it on race day.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the race day treatment using the poultice, which stewards have opened an inquiry into.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is a joke.</seg>
<seg id="38">People making these rules know nothing about the horse.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far," Moody said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his side's tackling as "agenda setting" by the NRL's two premiership favourites.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm to "wrestle" his side during the Storm's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm after his side's qualifying final win over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called that game a "showcase" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland weren't "too big" into wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended his side's tackling and said they just focused on their "contact" when tackling.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added he took confidence from having two leading coaches criticise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee we haven't changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques, it's just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tackles and that has been the turn around for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting football" reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne is talking about exciting footy.</seg>
<seg id="13">He made a point of comparing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn't give a rat's arse.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting footy, especially his young halves with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's the footy you would want to play when you have those sort of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made that point in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of footy - not every team has two halves like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.</seg>
<seg id="18">To me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking of us when they get to the big games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out the Storm and Roosters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet but what was the score? 16-12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game it was 20-18, there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting footy?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting?</seg>
<seg id="24">To me it's agendas.</seg>
<seg id="25">If they are mentioning us it means that at some stage we might meet them there.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night's preliminary final at AAMI Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="2">A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled into Queensland has been granted bail on a $200,000 surety.</seg>
<seg id="3">Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked at Coomera in August.</seg>
<seg id="4">Maksimovic was observed meeting with his co-accused at the marina throughout the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose.</seg>
<seg id="6">Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Maksimovic was a flight risk.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has clear connections to Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="8">He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the crown case he lied to police about where he was staying.</seg>
<seg id="10">Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a surety of $200,000 to secure his release.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Having read the affidavits of both those persons, it is clear that the imposition of a surety of $200,000 constitutes a real financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But that alone was insufficient to deter him from failing to appear, he warned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Maksimovic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police on a daily basis and adheres to a 6pm-6am curfew.</seg>

<seg id="2">A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit child abuse images.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone as she slept then logged into an online messaging service where he had a succession of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.</seg>
<seg id="4">The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping Hogg's hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">She looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately alerting her mother.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police attended and saw the five pictures, then analysed computers found at the address and discovered "concerning" web searches using terms for finding indecent image of children.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hogg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would "lead paedophiles" on the internet before "pretending he was a police officer to scare them."</seg>
<seg id="8">Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.</seg>
<seg id="9">He accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said he was doing it to lure them in.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying.</seg>
<seg id="14">She saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was then confronted.</seg>
<seg id="15">The girl was interviewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked way younger than him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making indecent images of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Defence solicitor Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was "no significant sexual element" to his crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentence until October for social work background reports.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hearings on other outstanding cases.</seg>

<seg id="6">"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business," said Whitman.</seg>
<seg id="7">As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have more than $50bn in annual revenue and "will be focused on delivering unrivaled integrated technology solutions" to companies, according to a company statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">It breaks up a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electric equipment, and whose Palo Alto garage has been dubbed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."</seg>
<seg id="10">HP has been undergoing a massive reorganisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.</seg>
<seg id="11">The move by HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms, is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tightly focused firms perform better.</seg>

<seg id="1">Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must get behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, providing his rehabilitation goes to plan, there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">That best-case scenario already means that Wilshere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and, given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship is clearly uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The great shame of this latest problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old sharpness during pre-season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This kind of injury is not career-threatening," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a bone that did not heal well.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is nothing major.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">That might be true from a purely medical perspective but, as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return midseason.</seg>
<seg id="11">There is also an uncomfortable pattern developing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Research by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different Wilshere ailments since he made his debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games during the last five seasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08, they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes, when you are coming back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to get over that.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body stabilises, I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">With Arsenal beginning their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger may also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to keep the balance and give a little breather to players who need it," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among Europe's most intimidating.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dinamo are also unbeaten in 41 matches after producing their own "Invincible" campaign last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earth tremor that measured 3.2 on the Richter.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger believes that Arsenal have learnt the lesson of last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This drive is immense," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has never been done at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were very close in 2006 but, on the other hand, I am long enough to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship</seg>
<seg id="2">The absence of similar portrayals in shows is glaring, particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever, with suicide rates amongst young males at 15 year high.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in males than females.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a bid to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Male, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students displaying depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of "healthy mood" friends, their chances of recovering doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Equally, for those not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the chances of mental challenges arising.</seg>
<seg id="8">But of course, for friendship to work, it needs to be accessible in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="9">In this age of social-media led communication, with its focus on style over substance, immediacy of response is often prioritised over meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality isolation is king.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists term extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply impacts our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">And as a billionaire video-game creator explained recently, money really doesn't buy greater happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each of the characters were not defined by their work, but rather their personalities, which shone through the interaction as friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humour of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football on the comfy chairs, and Ross's pining for Rachel, came from the knowledge that yes, men can all relate to this, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."my listening role to people feeling depressed and suicidal has really highlighted how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">Often the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old adage of "getting on with it" is strong, as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems."</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term coping mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">It highlighted the little moments of male friendship.</seg>
<seg id="21">As much as my objective, outsider status over the phone helps people in moments of desperation, the long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friend network.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so, if you attend Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, with the sets fully redesigned in celebration, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, better still, if in Starbucks you see someone alone, give a smile and say hello.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what difference your friendship could make.</seg>
<seg id="25">Friends is broadcasting on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest</seg>

<seg id="1">Di Maria scores to help PSG swat aside Malmo</seg>
<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG ease past Swedish side Malmo on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here's the match report and reaction to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way, but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cavani headed home in the 61st minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while they got the points, it was not a vintage display by Laurent Blanc's side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substituted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illustrious career back in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on," said Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="10">It augurs well.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we did, although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentina winger was labelled as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month, and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Verratti's pass in behind the Malmo defence before angling a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland and into the far corner of the net.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if anyone then expected PSG to romp to a big victory, they were to be disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, lined up with nine full internationals on the field at kick-off and, with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield, were stuffy opponents.</seg>
<seg id="16">But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG let themselves down at times with some wasteful passing and poor finishing, not least from Ibrahimovic, who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cavani just after the restart.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, he proved much more adept when it came to setting up his colleagues, and it was from an Ibrahimovic pass that Di Maria sent in a curling shot which was tipped around the post by Wiland on 52 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan heading home his sixth of the season after Ibrahimovic had flicked on a left-wing cross from Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">That ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game, and only a superb stop by Wiland from point-blank range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed right at the death.</seg>
<seg id="21">Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his side, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The qualifiers are not enough.</seg>
<seg id="24">Hats off to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a magnificent match from them.</seg>

<seg id="2">Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by collapsing commodities prices, on Wednesday raised $2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast debt-slashing plan.</seg>
<seg id="3">London-listed Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay down debt.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with tumbling commodity prices as China's economic slowdown weighs on demand and sparks havoc across markets.</seg>
<seg id="5">The rights issue sent Glencore's share price soaring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.</seg>
<seg id="7">Glencore had last week revealed the $2.5-billion shares sale as part of broader plans to slash its $30 billion debt pile by about a third.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company sold the new stock at 125 pence per share, which marked a 2.4-percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">It offloaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.</seg>

<seg id="1">Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking</seg>
<seg id="2">Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn't needed behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="3">During Sunday night's episode of HBO's Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor cut Brown off while she was emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen screenplay.</seg>
<seg id="4">"When we're talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show," Damon asserted.</seg>
<seg id="5">Shocked, Brown reacted with offended disbelief, letting out "Hoo! Wow. Okay," as The Martian actor's comments settled in the air.</seg>
<seg id="6">Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony," Brown initially said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The only black character who's a hooker who gets hit by her white pimp.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Dear White People producer pushed for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted their directing could "end up giving us something we don't want."</seg>
<seg id="10">After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval over Damon's comments.</seg>
<seg id="11">Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger toward the clip writing, "Matt Damon speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is SO WHITE it hurts."</seg>
<seg id="12">The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since being posted.</seg>
<seg id="13">Damon's comments come at a time where accurate racial representation in media is at the forefront of social discussion.</seg>
<seg id="14">After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took nationwide effect, urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against people of color.</seg>
<seg id="15">In February, singer Prince alluded to the movement while introducing the nominees of Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Albums still matter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Like books and black lives, albums still matter.</seg>
<seg id="18">More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question of whether the group should be considered a hate group.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," leaders said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Damon was recently announced as one of a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's portrayal in the West.</seg>
<seg id="21">Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope is unclear.</seg>

<seg id="2">Pro-rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win American Ninja Warrior Monday night taking home the $1 million grand prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">The competition show, which just wrapped up its 7th season, has never seen any competitor complete all stages of its obstacle course.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="5">The final task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="6">Britten went first completing the challenge on time, making him the first-ever athlete to complete American Ninja Warrior's grueling stage 4, however, Caldiero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner.</seg>
<seg id="7">Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-fought victory, still in shock about winning the $1 million grand prize.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I mean it's amazing to think about, like I've never made or lived off more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! of his serious pay-bump.</seg>
<seg id="9">So to all of a sudden...like I can't even imagine what it's going to be like...the future is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="10">Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why, despite Britten being the first ever competitor to finish the course, won't be awarded any prize money.</seg>
<seg id="11">By the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If there's more than one finisher, the one with the fastest time gets it," said Weed.</seg>
<seg id="13">As much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing, he does get the great gratification.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think he harbors any ill will about it.</seg>
<seg id="15">He's just so happy to have done what he's done.</seg>
<seg id="16">He's received tons of accolades from fans.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's such a great guy, and a family man.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's a hero to his kids and his wife.</seg>
<seg id="19">Geoff said to me, "If I was going to be beat by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."</seg>
<seg id="20">And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed.</seg>
<seg id="21">America Ninja Warrior was renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in Spring 2016.</seg>

<seg id="1">Detroit Tigers tiptoe past Minnesota Twins</seg>
<seg id="2">MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.</seg>
<seg id="4">Reducing to being a spoiler, the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Twins squandered a chance to climb to within one-half game of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that has been so elusive over much of the season's second half.</seg>
<seg id="7">"All wins are fun, no matter how it happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon made his early offensive support hold up, as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then tacked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was only his third quality start in his past nine outings.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I just want to finish strong this year," Simon said.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's hard for the bullpen to throw every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.</seg>
<seg id="13">Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.</seg>
<seg id="16">He looked good in (batting practice), looked noticeably better in BP, and he carried it right into the game.</seg>
<seg id="17">Trailing by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.</seg>
<seg id="18">Center fielder Byron Buxton led off the inning with a double down the left field line.</seg>
<seg id="19">Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt single, and Simon got second baseman Brian Dozier to strike out swinging before being lifted for left-hander Blaine Hardy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Hardy walked Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel Sano, who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew VerHagen.</seg>
<seg id="21">With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to ground into a double play.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was the major-league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit into a DP.</seg>
<seg id="23">After Detroit tacked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth, Mauer ripped an RBI double to the gap against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.</seg>
<seg id="25">Detroit took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes in the early going.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander, who came off the disabled list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Obviously not the start I'd like to have," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to execute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."</seg>
<seg id="28">After getting the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.</seg>
<seg id="29">A two-out walk to right fielder J.D. Martinez brought up Victor Martinez, who singled up the middle for the first run of the game.</seg>
<seg id="30">Victor Martinez snapped his 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring position.</seg>
<seg id="31">Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to right, scoring another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third, ending the threat.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Tigers added on in the second, getting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="33">"That was a big hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.</seg>
<seg id="34">He didn't hit it particularly well, but he got it in the right spot.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hughes, who was on a pitch count, pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.</seg>
<seg id="37">NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="38">He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on Sanchez's shoulder back in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="39">Sanchez, on the disabled list with a shoulder strain since mid-August, was scheduled to be activated for a Wednesday start.</seg>
<seg id="40">With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Norris will come off the DL to start against the Twins.</seg>
<seg id="41">Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for LHP David Price on July 30.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right oblique.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Tigers and Twins will wrap up their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="44">Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will oppose Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).</seg>

<seg id="1">Xi urges to open economy wider to world</seg>
<seg id="2">The economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise, and improve opening-up policies," he said, addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.</seg>
<seg id="4">Promoting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new impetus and vitality, and provide new room for economic growth, Xi said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regulating market access, relaxation of border-control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOE) to absorb private capital and overhauling the resident registration system.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the statement, a negative list, identifying sectors and businesses that are off-limits for investment, will be drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="7">The system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to companies, making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a bid to open up state-controlled sectors, more areas will be open to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment, and will protect the lawful interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits, or "green card," by optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process.</seg>
<seg id="14">Guaranteeing lawyers' right to practice and nurturing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="15">The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is possible to say that the small bags that are placed next to the big ones draw attention.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is said that small is beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="6">This point of view also applies to bags.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even though we didn't tire of walking the streets with almost-suitcase-sized bags, the tide has started to turn and bags are inclined to be smaller.</seg>
<seg id="8">Small bags already existed but they appeared before us in minimised versions of big shoulder bags.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only your telephone, credit card and keys fit inside these tiny bags.</seg>
<seg id="10">Starting with Céline and Hermès, the trend spread with Prada.</seg>
<seg id="11">Transforming this bag mania into an interest for mini-bags has affected the newly emerging models.</seg>
<seg id="12">Loewe presented the fun bags it created in two sizes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Among the bags, in the shape of pandas, polar bears and elephants, the most outstanding ones are the elephant-shaped ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">Presented by luxury brands with phenomenal names, mini versions of the big bags seem to attract red-carpet celebrities most.</seg>
<seg id="15">One of the most popular is the "Birkin" bag Hermès created as a dedication to Jane Birkin.</seg>
<seg id="16">Even though Jane Birkin said that she does not want her name to be remembered with a bag, she is now imprinted in the memory in this way.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fashion weeks led to the popularization of the mini-bag trend.</seg>
<seg id="18">Consequently, mini-bags have been prominent on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since they are very small, it is not really possible to wear them on your arm.</seg>
<seg id="20">They can be worn across the body with their long straps.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, we saw these straps tangled around the wrists of the models on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="22">Fendi is one of those taking the mini-bag theme one step forward.</seg>
<seg id="23">It has some advice for those who cannot fit into mini-bags but cannot abandon them either.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mini-bags as a friend of big bags.</seg>
<seg id="25">How?</seg>
<seg id="26">By transforming the mini-bags into a bag ornament that can be attached to bigger ones.</seg>
<seg id="27">Featured on the podiums, this presentation has taken to the streets very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="28">Let's see what else we will see!</seg>
<seg id="29">Denim changes skin</seg>
<seg id="30">Turkey is on a level that can compete with world brands in terms of denim.</seg>
<seg id="31">The experience gained in production has been enriched with design.</seg>
<seg id="32">Loft is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="33">We now see that black designs, having been few in the past, take their place on the shelves every season.</seg>
<seg id="34">Denim found its closest friend in a season when black colours are on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="35">Leather pieces and designs with leather details come to the forefront as the rebellious friend of denim.</seg>
<seg id="36">Generally, zippered short designs called "motorbike" are most prominent .</seg>
<seg id="37">The strong mood of leather complete with black pieces; chiffon long blouses and bright sweatshirts, provides a casual and chic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the past, young people wore denim and wanted to be lost in the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was thought that it would save the day.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nowadays, young people want to wear designs that are comfortable and emphasise their style at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="41">Within this perspective, it can be said that Loft correctly understood its target group with their collections and accessories it designed</seg>

<seg id="1">A small step for Banksy, a giant step for the "Global"</seg>
<seg id="2">Bringing together the works of mysterious street artist Banksy, the world première of the collection "The Art of Banksy" was held in Istanbul.</seg>
<seg id="3">A product of 15 years of work from the artist and gathering the originals of 85 works for the first time, the exhibition is the first in the Global Karaköy building .</seg>
<seg id="4">The first exhibition by the mysterious street artist Banksy in Istanbul opened yesterday in the Global Karaköy (Rıhtım Street).</seg>
<seg id="5">The world famous artist, who conceals his identity and uses an alias, was not present at the exhibition opening of course.</seg>
<seg id="6">We also don't know if he came to Istanbul or not.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, Banksy is not aware of this exhibition according to Steve Lazaridas, curator of the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not necessary to receive permission from him.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reason is that old friends Banksy and Lazaridas parted company with each other after 12 years.</seg>
<seg id="10">The exhibited works were partly collected from Lazaridas and collectors.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, there are issues that Banksy fans are curious about.</seg>
<seg id="12">What would Banksy think about the exhibition "The Art of Banksy" which brings together 85 of his works?</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, what would he think of entering the exhibition with a ticket (35 TL)? What would he say if he saw the 800 square metre gallery space with a small store created at the end?</seg>
<seg id="14">Would he raise his voice against the fact that cloth bags, wallets and necklaces are printed with works of his such as Red Balloon Girl, Maid, Smile Now, which draws attention to the wounds of the world?</seg>
<seg id="15">Banksy followers feel disappointed by the turning of an exhibition of an artist who conceals his identity and has an anarchist soul into such consumer goods.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is certainly not the style of Banksy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, get your limited availability tickets before they are sold out!</seg>
<seg id="18">Small for Banksy but giant for the globalised world, the exhibition "The Art of Banksy" can be seen until April.</seg>

<seg id="1">"While I was searching for two wrestler children, I found 26 people"</seg>
<seg id="2">The second documentary from Mete Gümürhan, "Young Wrestler", 66th.</seg>
<seg id="3">It became the first Turkish documentary to be selected in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival (February 11-21).</seg>
<seg id="4">Originally from Edirne but with a production company in the Netherlands, Gümürhan talked about how and why he shot the documentary which he completed in the summer of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="5">Telling the story of six students in a boarding school from Amasya who aimed at becoming the world champion in the field of wrestling, the documentary "Young Wrestlers" will compete in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival.</seg>
<seg id="6">Being the first made-in-Turkey documentary to be selected in this section, Young Wrestlers is one of the candidates for the Crystal Bear award.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mete Gümürhan is originally from Edirne even though he was born and raised in the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="8">He listened to stories about grease wrestling from his grandfather and watched competitions in Turkey, where he came during the summer when he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="9">"There are not only political problems in Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="10">I wanted to tell the world what is going on in Anatolia other than that.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the idea, "wrestling, one of our ancestor sports, is not well known", for example, he brought together 6 directors and wanted to create a documentary project.</seg>
<seg id="12">This project remained inconclusive but news in a magazine he read on a plane opened the door to another project for Gümürhan.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We stayed in a sugar factory"</seg>
<seg id="14">Tracing the article that talked about two little wrestler brothers aged 10-11, Mete Gümürhan went so Samsun, where their family lives.</seg>
<seg id="15">The father of the children did not give permission to shoot a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="16">Gümürhan talked about how he overcame this challenge as follows: "I thought about what I could do all day long."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Because the support of the Ministry of Culture might be withdrawn."</seg>
<seg id="18">The father mentioned a boarding school in Amasya, where the children would go.</seg>
<seg id="19">I thought of going there.</seg>
<seg id="20">While I was searching for two children, I found 26 children with an interest in wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="21">We started shooting preparations and finalized the authorization.</seg>
<seg id="22">We did not even have a place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We stayed in the dormitory of a sugar factory."</seg>
<seg id="24">Language was the biggest challenge posed for the director by the documentary, the shooting of which was completed in 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Stating that three different languages were spoken on the set of the film in which a foreign director of cinematography and a soundman worked, Gümürhan said, "I did not know what I would come across during the shoot."</seg>
<seg id="26">He says, "They did not know Turkish either".</seg>
<seg id="27">Young wrestlers focuses on the story of six of the 26 child wrestlers.</seg>
<seg id="28">Baran, who was brought up by his grandfather and had a weight problem, Harun, who could not participate in training because he broke his arm, Beytullah, who is ambitious but has some health problems, Ümit, who is the pretty boy of the school, the youngest champion Ahmet and Muhammed, who holds the group together...</seg>
<seg id="29">Mete Gümürhan says of working with the children as follows: "I let them be completely natural."</seg>
<seg id="30">I tried to use only Muhammed everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="31">I shot the training for the first one and a half weeks.</seg>
<seg id="32">I wanted that the children act as if there were no camera.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Fortunately they quickly adapted."</seg>
<seg id="34">It was a surprise to be selected for Berlin</seg>
<seg id="35">Stating that he did not expect Young Wrestlers to be selected for the Berlin Film Festival, Mete Gümürhan said, "We were ready, but it was a surprise for us to be selected for Berlin".</seg>
<seg id="36">Young Wrestlers is not a sports documentary, it is a production that narrates the struggle of the children and a slice of their life.</seg>
<seg id="37">He says, "I wanted to highlight the struggle of children with family problems to find an identity and their story of coping with their problems".</seg>

<seg id="1">Support from the world of art for the academics</seg>
<seg id="2">The storm that broke out after the declaration of "The Initiative of Academics for Peace", went so far that investigations were opened against the academics and they were taken into custody yesterday; but at the same time, there are also statements of support arriving one after another.</seg>
<seg id="3">The first support came from the literati, among whom there are many famous people.</seg>
<seg id="4">Film makers expressed their support the day before yesterday, and theatre actors did so yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the explanation made with the signatures of 138 theatre actors, it was stated, "We, as artists working in the field of theatre and stage-performance, stand by this honourable meeting of academics making a call for peace; and we state that we stand by the freedom of expression, equality, right to life and unconditional peace".</seg>
<seg id="6">It was said, "We add our voice to the discussion and peace calls from the academics with all our heart and conscience".</seg>
<seg id="7">More than 400 film makers including Deniz Türkali, Atilla Özdemiroğlu, Nadir Sarıbacak, Özcan Alper, Serra Yılmaz, Onur Ünlü, Yeşim Ustaoğlu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Karaçelik stated that, "We stand by free thought and art".</seg>
<seg id="8">Without using but, however and if: "We won't take part in this crime!"</seg>
<seg id="9">They supported the academics by saying, "We stand by the Initiative of the Academics for Peace".</seg>
<seg id="10">The Screenwriters Association (SİYAD) also made a statement and said, "We stand by the academics, who were made the target of a lynching campaign".</seg>
<seg id="11">The Initiative of Academics for Peace called for peace and discussion from the government with simultaneous statements in Ankara and Istanbul on January 11; and it published a declaration under the title, "We are not party to this crime".</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition to the 1128 academics from 89 universities, the text was signed by thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, and Etienne Balibar, who have worldwide fame through their theories and books.</seg>
<seg id="13">President Erdoğan and Prime Minister Davutoğlu defined the declaration of the academics as "support for terrorism" and criticised it very harshly; and Erdoğan called on organizations to "do what is needed".</seg>
<seg id="14">After this call, some universities fired the academics and the prosecution office brought an ex-officio prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many academics were taken into custody yesterday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hürrem Sultan's red hair, Beren's nose, Justin's hair...</seg>
<seg id="3">Trying to look like celebrities is considered normal to some extent but it is regarded as a psychological disorder after the point that it starts to completely affect your life.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Celebrity worship syndrome", also known as "the syndrome of worshipping famous people" is a matter that has already become an academic issue around the world and is a newly spoken about issue in our country.</seg>
<seg id="5">It can be considered normal to some extent that ladies run to the hair salons with photos of celebrities.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, we should not forget the "Hürrem Sultan" year when all the youth walked around with red Irish hair.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was already reported that "Beren's nose" led the way in plastic surgeries in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">The situation is not so very different on the part of men.</seg>
<seg id="9">Once upon a time, dressing like Polat Alemdar was a custom.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now a totally different trend prevails everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">Our surroundings are full of young boys that are copies of Justin Bieber.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is at such an extent that the following quote of useless information was read thousands of times: "Firstly, when you go to the hairdresser, have your hair cut at the sides, in other words, the part over and around your ears up to the upper part of your head."</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the sides should be short.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the cutting process is over, you should shape your hair lightly with water.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the shaping process, fix your hair with the help of spray.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is necessary to shape it when it is wet to get Justin hair."</seg>
<seg id="17">All of these issues have already become academic subjects around the world, but they remind us of the newly spoken "celebrity worship syndrome", in other words "the syndrome of worshipping famous people".</seg>
<seg id="18">Fans of celebrities are considered as a "bundle of love".</seg>
<seg id="19">Artists always pride themselves on their fan numbers and how their fans affect them.</seg>
<seg id="20">Luckily, psychology does not consider the condition so simply.</seg>
<seg id="21">In particular, it is much discussed that adolescents make decisions about what they eat and drink, what they listen to, what they wear in accordance with celebrities.</seg>
<seg id="22">Excessive loyalty to people presented as unattainable, and taking them as role models is defined as a mental disorder.</seg>
<seg id="23">Senior psychologist Sümeyye Demir accepts that Turkey falls behind in terms of studies into this field.</seg>
<seg id="24">However she does not fail to notice the fact that families are gradually becoming conscious: "One of the basic issues in the science of psychology is people being at peace with themselves and finding peace in their identities".</seg>
<seg id="25">In the past, it was not taken seriously if children filled their rooms with posters and played the role of someone.</seg>
<seg id="26">This situation is now changing.</seg>
<seg id="27">Their parents feel the need to intervene in the situation.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Passionate loyalty to someone is a sign of the fact that something has gone wrong in the teen's life."</seg>
<seg id="29">Fans jumping onto the emotional speed train</seg>
<seg id="30">Interest in celebrity is safe in moderation.</seg>
<seg id="31">Demir advises to be careful of symptoms such as not wanting them to marry, envying their spouses and preferring their clothing styles.</seg>
<seg id="32">As the name implies, we are talking about famous people.</seg>
<seg id="33">Being curious about them and having an interest in their life is considered normal to some extent.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, young people overstepping the limits are prevalent according to the senior psychologist: "When there is no one in the family or the surroundings to serve as a model for virtues and good behaviour, this gap is certainly filled."</seg>
<seg id="35">Good examples do not always emerge.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Children also copy the negative things."</seg>
<seg id="37">When we consult her about how we should approach them, Sümeyye Demir starts by reminding us that the syndrome of celebrity worship is seen mostly in adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="38">The problem is more easily overcome once it is taken into consideration that adolescents may be insecure.</seg>
<seg id="39">On one hand, we are complaining about the limitations of family and on the other hand we are facing young people expecting support and affection from them: "We are obliged to take into consideration their emotional ups and downs."</seg>
<seg id="40">New research put forward that they are forced by the changes occurring in their brains.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It should be taken naturally if an adolescent, jumping onto the emotional speed train, is attached to someone; and they should be approached delicately."</seg>
<seg id="42">It is possible to change behaviour</seg>
<seg id="43">Senior psychologist Sümeyye Demir, reminds us of the duties falling into the share of parents to overcome celebrity worship syndrome:</seg>
<seg id="44">Identify their emotional problem and be sure that you are calm before bringing up the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">Never let them suppress their emotions.</seg>
<seg id="46">Express your respect for their adoration in order to encourage freedom.</seg>
<seg id="47">Instead of teaching them by reprimanding, serve as a good model for them, discuss the people that can be a role model to them.</seg>
<seg id="48">Try to talk together about the roles of celebrities in our daily life.</seg>
<seg id="49">It would be helpful to read books about the real world of celebrities together.</seg>
<seg id="50">Change your communication approach to the form of adult to adult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Do not forget the fact that addiction and motivation use the brain in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="52">Tell your child that errors are opportunities for change, and accept them as they are.</seg>
<seg id="53">Get the support of specialists dealing with being a fan.</seg>
<seg id="54">Those who get angry and those who admire both worship</seg>
<seg id="55">At the base of the syndrome of celebrity worship there is a need to appeal and get help from someone.</seg>
<seg id="56">It is in fact a unpreventable love, a call for help.</seg>
<seg id="57">But unfortunately it is not perceived like this.</seg>
<seg id="58">Furthermore, this problem is so widespread that it is not possible to narrow it down to a country or a continent.</seg>
<seg id="59">Dr. Recai Yahyaoğlu draws attention to the fact that there are certain people that occupy the television in every country.</seg>
<seg id="60">The syndrome manifests itself mostly in an attachment to the celebrities: "They are extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="61">Most people do not have their opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="62">Those who have do not live their life by acting like them.</seg>
<seg id="63">It is because they do not embrace this life or they do not dare to do it.</seg>
<seg id="64">"However, both those who do not have the opportunities, and those who have the opportunities but do not live like them continue to watch them angrily."</seg>
<seg id="65">There is no difference between those who covet them and those who watch them bursting with anger.</seg>
<seg id="66">Both admire them inwardly.</seg>
<seg id="67">They earn money without trouble, they are in magazines daily.</seg>
<seg id="68">Even knowing this is enough to increase their admiration.</seg>
<seg id="69">Other advice from the senior psychologist Sümeyye Demir is to question the reality of these lives.</seg>
<seg id="70">We should not fail to notice that artificial lives are being talked about.</seg>
<seg id="71">Support from the surrounding people steps in for the person who feels passionately about celebrity.</seg>
<seg id="72">However, people insist on rejecting the fact that the celebrities they admire also have problems like them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Should I undergo a cholecystostomy? - Family-Health News - Zaman Newspaper</seg>
<seg id="2">Dr. Fevzi Özgönül answers the questions in his column in the Meydan Newspaper..</seg>
<seg id="3">I have gallstones, I have stomach ache when I get up every morning and after meals; and I visit the toilet 2 times or more everyday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Could it prevent me from losing weight?</seg>
<seg id="5">I have now started to use alkaline, but my appetite for meals hasn't diminished, I cannot lose any weight.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has been the same since my childhood.</seg>
<seg id="7">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="8">In your opinion, should I undergo a cholecystostomy?</seg>
<seg id="9">ANSWER: Most of the time, an infection accompanies gallstones.</seg>
<seg id="10">This complaint of stomach aches, occurring soon after meals, is a sign of the fact that your gallbladder tightens when you eat and you spill the infected gall into the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="11">Disturbed by the infected gall, the intestines try to quickly expel this gall.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is why you visit the toilet frequently.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since you visit the toilet frequently and what you eat is expelled without being digested, losing weight becomes slower.</seg>
<seg id="14">In my opinion, you should have this condition treated.</seg>
<seg id="15">If you go to a gastroenterologist and the condition is detected as I said, you can be free from this condition by using antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, you may eventually have to undergo a cholecystostomy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alkaline probiotics may decrease your symptons but it does not cure them.</seg>
<seg id="18">I advise you to use alkaline probiotics anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because this probiotic powder is the biggest help in losing weight.</seg>
<seg id="20">I eat too much under stress</seg>
<seg id="21">Dear sir, I eat continuously when I am stressed and angry; and I gain weight.</seg>
<seg id="22">How can I cope with this?</seg>
<seg id="23">ANSWER: An excessive appetite for food means in fact that your energy needs are not met.</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason for this may be eating less or skipping morning meals and lunches.</seg>
<seg id="25">Another reason is your failure to digest the food you eat.</seg>
<seg id="26">To do this, your digestive system should work healthily.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you do not have a problem such as an ulcer, reflux or similar problems, the easiest way is to use a good probiotic medicine.</seg>
<seg id="28">You will greatly feel its benefits.</seg>
<seg id="29">I cannot gain weight, doctors do not know the reason</seg>
<seg id="30">Generally there is information about losing weight in your column.</seg>
<seg id="31">All of it seems logical to me too, but my situation is a little bit different.</seg>
<seg id="32">Somehow I cannot gain weight.</seg>
<seg id="33">The most important thing is I do not know why.</seg>
<seg id="34">Doctors do not say anything either.</seg>
<seg id="35">ANSWER: The techniques we apply are not intended for losing weight, but also regaining the physiological functions of the body and turning it into its ideal size.</seg>
<seg id="36">Being overweight and being too thin are the same kinds of disorder.</seg>
<seg id="37">Failure to lose weight when fat and failure to gain weight when slim are cured with the same technique.</seg>
<seg id="38">You lose weight more when you eat sweets and pastries.</seg>
<seg id="39">I imagine you might have understood this by now.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is also possible for you to be stimulated with Carboxy therapy and gain weight through a healthy diet.</seg>
<seg id="41">In other words, you became distant from your ideal body by losing weight.</seg>
<seg id="42">Other patients of ours became distant from their ideal bodies by putting on weight.</seg>
<seg id="43">You will reach your ideal body by gaining weight, and they will do so by losing weight.</seg>
<seg id="44">If the problem with the system is eliminated, you will gain weight, they will lose weight.</seg>
<seg id="45">Nevertheless, firstly the system should work properly.</seg>

<seg id="1">Children who feel worthless become stuck in "hatred"</seg>
<seg id="2">There are some innate emotions in people's world of emotion.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fear, sadness, happiness, astonishment, anger, anxiety...</seg>
<seg id="4">However, some emotions like hatred, holding a grudge and revenge emerge in children gradually and as a result of the wrong behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everybody needs to be an individual including during their childhood.</seg>
<seg id="6">In other words, they desire that their parents and social circle respect their decisions, their opinion is asked in matters related to them, and they are made to feel valued.</seg>
<seg id="7">Enabling them to create the base on which to construct a healthy personality.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, behaviour such as making decisions in matters relating to the child (what they wear, what they eat) instead of the child, insisting on your truth without considering the wishes of the child (sending a child to a music course even though they want to go to a football course) means not respecting the personality of the child.</seg>
<seg id="9">When their individuality and being are not respected, children lose the freedom of "being themselves" and their defence mechanism reveals emotions of anger and hatred in order to protect themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">Stating that, "The reason is that anger and hatred are in fact just opposites of acceptance", psychologist Hilal Arslan says that children do not accept what is done to them by showing hate and they try to say to both themselves and the people around them that they are precious.</seg>
<seg id="11">Saying that it is good for their personality development that children do not accept the situation and react to it, the senior psychologist said, "The hatred here means I am also here, it serves the children's aim to protect their self-respect".</seg>
<seg id="12">She says, "If children are allowed to be individuals, the hatred will be eliminated".</seg>
<seg id="13">Children try to protect their self by resorting to anger and hatred</seg>
<seg id="14">Saying that if children are exposed to the verbal and emotional violence of their parents and surroundings, it will cause negative emotions in children in a time that they are at a young age and are both physically and spiritually most vulnerable, Arslan states that negligence will make the child feel that their existence is not noticed and they are invisible.</seg>
<seg id="15">Arslan continues with the following: "Maybe sometimes we can fail to meet the emotional needs (not stroking their hair, not hugging and kissing them, not caring about their school or other needs), and sometimes we can fail to meet also their physical needs (eating, drinking, shelter, school needs etc.)."</seg>
<seg id="16">This is a growing attitude that opens the doors to anger and hatred.</seg>
<seg id="17">For emotional and verbal violence, there is behaviour like humiliation, insulting, belittling, scolding, unnecessary and heavy punishment, making them feel worthless and yelling.</seg>
<seg id="18">Since this behaviour is towards the personality of the child, it has a deep effect.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Children who accept it, lose their self-respect and spend their lives struggling with the feeling that they are worthless, unworthy of being loved and inadequate, or they will protect themselves by resorting to anger and hatred."</seg>

<seg id="3">As members of PEN, the writers wanted Cameron to bring up the decline experienced in freedom of expression and the press in Turkey in his meeting with Davutoğlu.</seg>
<seg id="4">Leading writers in the United Kingdom sent a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron asking him to bring up the decline experienced in freedom of expression and the press in Turkey during the London visit by his counterpart Ahmet Davutoğlu next week.</seg>
<seg id="5">Including England, Wales and Scotland, Presidents of the Worldwide Association of Writers (PEN), the 25 writers expressed their serious concerns about "the unprecedented pressures towards freedom of expression in Turkey".</seg>
<seg id="6">Stating that threats and physical attacks against journalists, writers and publishers in Turkey have become a normal part of life, giving the examples of the attacks on the offices of the Hurriyet daily newspaper, the raid on the Koza İpek Media Group and seizure of it.</seg>
