<seg id="1">Brazil's Former Presidential Chief-of-Staff to Stand Trial</seg>
<seg id="2">A federal judge on Tuesday accepted the charges filed against Brazil's former presidential chief of staff for his alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme at state-owned oil company Petrobras.</seg>
<seg id="3">The federal prosecutor's office said Jose Dirceu will face trial on the corruption, racketeering and money laundering charges filed earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fourteen other people will also be tried, including Joao Vaccari Neto, the former treasurer of Brazil's governing Workers' Party and Renato de Souza Duque, Petrobras' former head of corporate services.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dirceu is the most senior member of the ruling Workers' Party to be taken into custody in connection with the scheme.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dirceu served as former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's chief of staff between 2003 and 2005.</seg>
<seg id="7">He was arrested early August in his home, where he already was under house arrest serving an 11-year sentence for his involvement in a cash-for-votes scheme in Congress more than 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">Prosecutors have said that Dirceu masterminded the kickback scheme at Petrobras, accepted bribes while in office and continued to receive payments from contractors after he was jailed in late 2013 for the vote-buying scandal.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to prosecutors, the scheme at Petrobras involved roughly $2 billion in bribes and other illegal funds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some of that money was allegedly funneled back to campaign coffers of the ruling party and its allies.</seg>
<seg id="11">It also allegedly included the payment of bribes to Petrobras executives in return for inflated contracts.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Miraculous' recovery for Peshawar massacre schoolboy</seg>
<seg id="2">A teenager paralysed after being shot four times in Pakistan's deadliest terror attack has made a "miraculous" recovery following treatment in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, 13, had been told by doctors in Pakistan that he would never walk again.</seg>
<seg id="4">At least 140 people, mostly children, were killed when gunmen stormed Peshawar's Army Public School last December.</seg>
<seg id="5">Muhammad, who arrived in London last month for surgery, is being discharged from hospital later.</seg>
<seg id="6">Exactly nine months ago, on an ordinary Tuesday morning, Muhammad sat in his first aid class listening to his teachers intently.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the same time seven gunmen disguised in security uniforms were entering the Army Public School.</seg>
<seg id="8">They were strapped with explosives and had one simple mission in mind: Kill every man, woman and child they came across.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I can't forget what happened that day," Muhammad says with a severe stare.</seg>
<seg id="10">We were sitting in the auditorium, we were asking questions... and then we heard heavy gunfire outside.</seg>
<seg id="11">The terrorists moved inside and they started killing - our teacher was burned alive.</seg>
<seg id="12">Muhammad described pulling four other pupils out of the auditorium as the carnage unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said he then heard his friend, Hamza calling to him.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said, 'oh brother save me'.</seg>
<seg id="15">I held his hand.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's when I was shot in the back, and he was shot in the head.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most of the people killed in the attack were pupils</seg>
<seg id="18">Hamza died in Muhammad's arms.</seg>
<seg id="19">Muhammad recalled blacking out after that, and the next thing he knew he was in a hospital bed, paralysed from the waist down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Doctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, and then Rawalpindi, close to the capital, told his family there was no treatment, and he would never walk again.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Seeing him I felt like my soul had left my body," says Muhammad's father, Sher Khan</seg>
<seg id="22">Those nine months were the hardest in my life.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Mr Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their cricket-mad son would never be able to use his legs again.</seg>
<seg id="24">They campaigned, and appealed for help on Pakistani TV, gaining the support of high profile people such as cricketer turned politician Imran Khan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Finally, they were able to raise the funds to bring Muhammad to the UK and provide him with treatment at London's private Harley Street Clinic.</seg>
<seg id="26">Consultant neurosurgeon Irfan Malik described Muhammad as "terrified" when he first arrived at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="27">"He'd spent the last [few] months lying on a bed, unable to move side to side," says Mr Malik.</seg>
<seg id="28">He was weak, he had a pressure sore on his back.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wasn't in great shape.</seg>
<seg id="30">A vertebra at the base of Muhammad's spine was destroyed</seg>
<seg id="31">Muhammad was shot in his shoulder, his hip, and his back during the attack, damaging his lower spine - leading to paralysis.</seg>
<seg id="32">But during six hours of surgery, Mr Malik and his team were able to reattach nerve endings and reconstruct the damaged part of the spine.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even Mr Malik was surprised at what happened next.</seg>
<seg id="34">Exactly one week after the surgery Muhammad stood up and started taking steps and walking.</seg>
<seg id="35">We were not expecting to get that sort of excellent result.</seg>
<seg id="36">That was miraculous," he says.</seg>
<seg id="37">Less than two weeks after his operation, Muhammad is ready to leave hospital and start the long road to recovery.</seg>
<seg id="38">Muhammad has defied the odds and started to walk again</seg>
<seg id="39">He says he wants to build his strength and continue his education in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="40">But he says he is determined to return to Pakistan, join the army and help fight terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="41">"I feel like I have a second chance at life," he says as he shows off pictures he's drawn of guns scribbled out next to school books and pens</seg>
<seg id="42">Muhammad grows physically stronger every day but the psychological trauma he continues to endure is unimaginable.</seg>
<seg id="43">"My anger is not diminishing" he says.</seg>
<seg id="44">In my school little kids were killed.</seg>
<seg id="45">What was their crime?</seg>
<seg id="46">His mother, wiping a tear from her eye, caressed his head and said: "I can see my son walking again."</seg>
<seg id="47">He'll be able to get on with his normal life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steven Wilson: 'If I don't do anything, I feel this creeping guilt'</seg>
<seg id="2">Steven Wilson was recently the big winner at the Progressive Music Awards</seg>
<seg id="3">Steven Wilson is often dubbed the hardest working musician in the world of progressive rock.</seg>
<seg id="4">The multi-talented musician won three prizes at this month's Progressive Music Awards in London, including album of the year for Hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Guardian's five-star review called it "a smart, soulful and immersive work of art."</seg>
<seg id="6">Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the driving force in a number of musical projects, the best known of which is the rock band Porcupine Tree.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now, ahead of two sell-out shows at the Royal Albert Hall, Wilson is releasing a vinyl-only double LP, Transience, to showcase the "more accessible" side of his solo output.</seg>
<seg id="8">He tells the BBC about his love of vinyl, his busy schedule and explains how comic actor Matt Berry came to be his support act.</seg>
<seg id="9">What does vinyl mean to you?</seg>
<seg id="10">I grew up at the very tail end of the vinyl era, and at the time, I remember, we couldn't wait for CD to come along because vinyl was so frustrating.</seg>
<seg id="11">You would buy the record, take it home, and it would have a scratch, and you would have to take it back again.</seg>
<seg id="12">I love CDs, and for some kinds of music - classical for example - it is better than vinyl.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the problem with the CD and digital downloads is that there's nothing you can really cherish or treasure.</seg>
<seg id="14">Owning vinyl is like having a beautiful painting hanging in your living room.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's something you can hold, pore over the lyrics and immerse yourself in the art work.</seg>
<seg id="16">I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it can't be if kids too young to remember vinyl are enjoying that kind of experience.</seg>
<seg id="17">Do you have a piece of vinyl that you treasure?</seg>
<seg id="18">The truth is I got rid of 100% of my vinyl in the 90s.</seg>
<seg id="19">All the vinyl I have is re-bought.</seg>
<seg id="20">I started off from the perspective that I wanted to recreate the collection I had when I was 15, but it's gone beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="21">The first record which I persuaded my parents to buy for me was Electric Light Orchestra's Out of the Blue.</seg>
<seg id="22">If I still had my original copy, it would have sentimental value, but, alas, it's in a charity shop somewhere.</seg>
<seg id="23">Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a doorway for potential new fans</seg>
<seg id="24">Why release your new compilation Transience on vinyl?</seg>
<seg id="25">It was originally conceived as an idea for Record Store Day, but we missed the boat on that.</seg>
<seg id="26">My record company had suggested I put together some of my shorter, more accessible songs.</seg>
<seg id="27">I got a bit obsessed by the idea to make something like "an introduction to Steven Wilson," and I was committed to it being a vinyl-only release.</seg>
<seg id="28">Anyone who buys the vinyl does also get a high-resolution download.</seg>
<seg id="29">Do you have a concern that the album won't show your work in a true light?</seg>
<seg id="30">No - because although I do focus on more long-form pieces of music, there is one thing I have always valued above everything else: melody.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is a lot of progressive rock which focuses on the technical complexity of the track rather than the melodic side.</seg>
<seg id="32">Pink Floyd, the most successful progressive rock band of all time, have stood the test of time because the emphasis was always on melody and atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="33">What do you have in store for your Albert Hall shows?</seg>
<seg id="34">I don't want to give away too much.</seg>
<seg id="35">The repertoire will be completely different each night.</seg>
<seg id="36">The first night is going to be a version of the Hand. Erase. show I've been doing this year - but on steroids - with a couple of guests.</seg>
<seg id="37">The second night is going to be more of a trip into my history, which is more aimed at the fans have been following me for years.</seg>
<seg id="38">How did it come about that Matt Berry is the support act on the second night?</seg>
<seg id="39">Myself and everyone on the tour bus are massive fans of [Channel 4 comedy series] Toast of London to the point that we are quoting it endlessly.</seg>
<seg id="40">I thought that I should check out Matt's music, so I picked up a copy of his Music for Insomniacs.</seg>
<seg id="41">I chatted with him about our love of Mike Oldfield and asked him to play at the Royal Albert Hall.</seg>
<seg id="42">I'm going to be incredibly star struck by my opening act.</seg>
<seg id="43">You've been remixing albums by the likes of XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.</seg>
<seg id="44">How much does that influence your own work?</seg>
<seg id="45">I don't consciously draw from that, but, inevitably, if you are deconstructing these classic albums they really get into your head.</seg>
<seg id="46">My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was without doubt the most old-school progressive album I've ever done.</seg>
<seg id="47">I don't think it was coincidence that I had been remixing King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost exclusively for the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="48">The current album, Hand. Erase., opened up a lot more because I'd been working on Tears for Fears and XTC.</seg>
<seg id="49">You are often described as progressive rock's busiest musician.</seg>
<seg id="50">Is that how it feels?</seg>
<seg id="51">You can remove the word progressive.</seg>
<seg id="52">I think I am probably one of the most work-obsessed people in the music business today, and I don't say that with any sense of pride because believe me it's a curse.</seg>
<seg id="53">I think I get it from my father, who also had an incredibly strong work ethic.</seg>
<seg id="54">If I don't do anything for a whole day, I start to feel this creeping guilt.</seg>
<seg id="55">That's why the remix work has been such a gift to me because it means I don't have to be doing my own music all the time.</seg>
<seg id="56">The music industry is a hard place to make a living for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="57">I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as a profession now.</seg>
<seg id="58">I work every day, and I'm not rich, but I make a good living.</seg>
<seg id="59">I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I was lazy about it, I don't think I'd be able to survive.</seg>
<seg id="60">Transience is out in the UK on 25 September.</seg>
<seg id="61">Steven Wilson plays the Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September as part of his 2015-16 tour of Europe.</seg>

<seg id="2">The new Skytrans has re-employed some of the airline staff who lost their jobs when the original Skytrans collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Reborn north Queensland airline Skytrans has secured a $25 million contract to transport natural gas company QGC workers, which has led to 18 staff getting their jobs back.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Wild family-owned Skytrans went bust in January, after the Newman government awarded the subsidised routes that formed a large part of the airline's business.</seg>
<seg id="5">The collapse led to several communities facing potential isolation, with federal LNP north Queensland MP Warren Entsch leading a chorus of criticism of the state LNP government.</seg>
<seg id="6">Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, relaunched the Skytrans brand in March.</seg>
<seg id="7">Skytrans chief executive Michael Thinee said the airline's contract with QCG had already created jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We have been able to re-employ 18 Skytrans staff back into full time employment as pilots and cabin crew," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">We are also pleased to welcome new staff who have direct logistics experience managing flight operations for QGC customers.</seg>
<seg id="10">We have grown our workforce by 100 per cent in just five months, with 78 staff being employed in Cairns and now Brisbane.</seg>
<seg id="11">The contract would see Skytrans expand its flight operations from its Cairns headquarters, which services Cape York and the Torres Strait, to also include a base in Brisbane.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skytrans will operate 18 return flights per week for QGC staff and contractors from Brisbane to sites in Chinchilla and Taroom on its 36-seat Dash-8s from Monday, October 26.</seg>
<seg id="13">QGC managing director Tony Nunan said Skytrans was awarded the contract after a competitive tender process.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We're delighted that this contract will help a Queensland company to expand," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Skytrans contract maintains high quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.</seg>

<seg id="1">Liberal MP and new mum Kelly O'Dwyer told to express more breast milk to avoid missing votes in the chamber</seg>
<seg id="2">More women likely for cabinet</seg>
<seg id="3">Malcolm Turnbull's new ministry will be sworn in on Monday, with a strong indication there will be more women on the front bench.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the government's rising stars, Kelly O'Dwyer, has been advised to express more breast milk for her newborn baby to avoid her breastfeeding interfering with her duties in the parliamentary chamber.</seg>
<seg id="5">The advice came from the office of the government's Chief Whip Scott Buchholz, who subsequently had to consult his Labor counterpart to find out how to better deal with a breastfeeding MP in accordance with the standing orders.</seg>
<seg id="6">Liberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter Olivia.</seg>
<seg id="7">Under the standing orders - the set of rules which govern behaviour of MPs in the chamber - new mothers who are breastfeeding are given a proxy vote in the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="8">This means their vote is counted even though they are not physically in the chamber.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the Whip was unaware of the exemption until he consulted the opposition's Chief Whip, Chris Hayes, about the matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">The issue flared up on two occasions when Ms O'Dwyer was unable to attend a division and a speaking obligation because she had just begun breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="11">On one of these occasions her office was asked whether the MP had considered expressing more milk instead of breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="12">Queensland MP Scott Buchholz is the government's Chief Whip.</seg>
<seg id="13">The pair have subsequently resolved the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both declined to comment when contacted by Fairfax Media but sources separate to Mr Buchholz and Ms O'Dwyer told Fairfax Media the Member for Higgins was furious at being told to consider expressing more milk over breastfeeding her daughter Olivia, who was born in May.</seg>
<seg id="15">The revelation comes as new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull works on the shape of his new cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Buchholz, a Queensland Liberal National MP was promoted to the job of Chief Whip by former prime minister Tony Abbott, as part of the fallout from the attempted spill in February earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ms O'Dwyer, pictured with Labor's Amanda Rishworth and son Percy, is one of three new mums in the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="18">The former whip Phillip Ruddock was dumped just days after Mr Abbott stared down a spill motion to remove him as leader and was replaced with Mr Buchholz.</seg>
<seg id="19">Another Abbott loyalist, Tasmanian Liberal Andrew Nickolic was also promoted and made a Deputy Whip.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Nickolic has made headlines in recent days, after it was revealed he texted Mr Turnbull demanding he rule out a challenge to Mr Abbott's leadership.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ms O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time in August since giving birth to her baby Olivia in May.</seg>
<seg id="22">She is one of three new mothers in the Parliament this year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Labor's health spokeswoman Catherine King said on Wednesday that the proxy vote for breastfeeding mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.</seg>
<seg id="24">"He is now [seven years old]," she tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Whip should have known.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ms O'Dwyer was promoted to the frontbench late last year and could be promoted under Mr Turnbull who on Wednesday said he wanted more women in his cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="27">"There is no greater enthusiast than me to see more women in positions of power, influence, Parliament, ministries, right across the country," the Prime Minister told reporters at Parliament House.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr Abbott included just one woman in his first cabinet and after sustained pressure to boost female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman into cabinet in the December reshuffle.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five things business wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull</seg>
<seg id="2">Malcolm Turnbull: how will markets react?</seg>
<seg id="3">BusinessDay columnist Mal Maiden examines what impact Malcolm Turnbull might have on Australia's business sector.</seg>
<seg id="4">The business lobby could not shout its approval loudly enough on Tuesday as Malcolm Turnbull took the nation's reins as Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="5">The key reason is that so much of what many of them would like to see had been taken off the table under the leadership of Tony Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="6">Either that, or it had sunk into a negotiated standstill through Abbott's crash-or-crash-through political style.</seg>
<seg id="7">With one voice the lobbyists talked about a hoped-for ability in Turnbull to make the public argument, to cut the political deal and get tough things done.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what exactly are the nation's biggest companies, and their lobbyists, looking for in our new Prime Minister?</seg>
<seg id="9">ChAFTA will be an early test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity.</seg>
<seg id="10">Turnbull himself put the China free trade deal up on the tee as an early goal.</seg>
<seg id="11">In his first speech to the media announcing the challenge, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA) was the focal point for his attack on Labor leader Bill Shorten.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a speech in August, Turnbull decried "outrage outbursts of economic chauvinism" from Labor over the issue and raised concerns about a racial edge to the criticism.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In the ChAFTA context the winners overwhelmingly outnumber the losers," he said in the same speech.</seg>
<seg id="14">Business is pinning its hopes on his winning this debate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Business legend Don Argus was quick to make this a key point, he was echoed by the Business Council of Australia (which represents the nation's 100 biggest companies), gaming billionaire James Packer and others.</seg>
<seg id="16">Business wants this deal done and it will be an early test of both Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity and also to negotiate with the senate cross-bench.</seg>
<seg id="17">Small Business Minister Bruce Billson supports the Harper Review recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="18">This issue is shaping as a potential early rift with the business community.</seg>
<seg id="19">The effects test is applied in big mergers and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer from a lack of competition.</seg>
<seg id="20">It's called an "effects test" because it takes into account not only a company's actions and intent, but the effect that they have on competitors and the market.</seg>
<seg id="21">How that test is worded is extremely important to the outcome.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Harper review of competition law recommended a change to the effects test that will make harder for large corporates to squeeze smaller operators out.</seg>
<seg id="23">Under Tony Abbott, the government was all set to side with the Business Council of Australia and the big retailers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Turnbull has now signalled he wants to have a full cabinet consider what to do next.</seg>
<seg id="25">The BCA has jumped straight out of the blocks to say consumers will pay higher prices if Turnbull takes up the Harper review's recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="26">One irony is that business has also strongly urged the new Prime Minister to have a greater respect for cabinet process, which is Turnbull seems to be doing in allowing his Small Business Minister Bruce Billson (who supports the Harper recommendation) to makes his case to his colleagues.</seg>

<seg id="2">Terrence Howard believes that we've got arithmetic all wrong.</seg>
<seg id="3">The "Empire" villain told Rolling Stone that he does not believe one times one equals one.</seg>
<seg id="4">"How can it equal one?" he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">If one times one equals one that means that two is of no value because one times itself has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="6">One times one equals two because the square root of four is two, so what's the square root of two?</seg>
<seg id="7">Should be one, but we're told it's two, and that cannot be.</seg>
<seg id="8">We lost you there, Terrence.</seg>
<seg id="9">Unsurprisingly, Howard's teachers did not agree with his theory, and he subsequently left Pratt Institute, where he was studying chemical engineering.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I mean, you can't conform when you know innately that something is wrong," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="11">Howard calls his parallel take on math "Terrylogy."</seg>
<seg id="12">The actor said he spends time cutting and re-forming scissors, wire, magnets and sheets of plastic to illustrate his one-times-one theory and other similar theories he has.</seg>
<seg id="13">He told the magazine that he and his ex-wife Mira Pak would spend up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Rolling Stone writer described Howard's creations as "building blocks but the shapes are infinitely more complex, in two dimensions and three, tied together by copper wire or held in place by magnets."</seg>
<seg id="15">Howard said he hopes to inherit U.S. patent 20150079872 A1 ("Systems and methods for enhanced building-block applications"), among others.</seg>
<seg id="16">The "Hustle and Flow" actor also said that Pythagoras, Einstein and Tesla would "lose [their minds]" if they saw Terryology.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Since I was a child of three or four," he said, "I was always wondering, you know, why does a bubble take the shape of a ball?"</seg>
<seg id="18">Why not a triangle or a square?</seg>
<seg id="19">I figured it out.</seg>
<seg id="20">Howard added that he hopes to change the course of education.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is the last century that our children will ever have been taught that one times one is one," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">They won't have to grow up in ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="23">Twenty years from now, they'll know that one times one equals two.</seg>
<seg id="24">We're about to show a new truth.</seg>
<seg id="25">The true universal math.</seg>

<seg id="1">Taco Bell hopes wine-serving 'Cantinas' will become urban hotspots</seg>
<seg id="2">Looking for a swanky night out?</seg>
<seg id="3">Consider Taco Bell.</seg>
<seg id="4">On September 22, the Mexican style fast food chain will open up a new location in Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood featuring a tapas-style menu of appetizers, a mural from a local artist, and even alcoholic beverages.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's the first of the chain's 'Taco Bell Cantina' test locations, aimed at catering to a younger crowd increasingly concentrated in city centers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Taco Bell, which has nearly 6,000 US locations, is rooted primarily in suburban areas and associated with cheap, quick eats, like the wildly popular Doritos Locos Taco.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the average Taco Bell tab in the $7 range, the company has utilized drive-throughs and fast service to attract the quantity of customers needed to turn a profit.</seg>
<seg id="8">But to cater to Millennials "seeking more urban environments to live, work, and play," according to Taco Bell, the test locations must follow a different model, with smaller footprints and pricier options.</seg>
<seg id="9">To put in a drive-thru you need land.</seg>
<seg id="10">Can you imagine buying an acre of land in a neighborhood like Wicker Park?</seg>
<seg id="11">"You couldn't afford it," Neil Borkan, the Taco Bell franchisee who will operate the Chicago location told USA TODAY.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the Chicago location, new menu items will be prepared alongside Taco Bell's traditional offerings in an open kitchen, where "you will literally be able to see the food" before it's prepared, Taco Bell's Chief Development Officer Meredith Sandland told the Associated Press.</seg>
<seg id="13">The new location will also serve wine, beer, and frozen alcoholic drinks, echoing recent moves by many of Taco Bell's competitors.</seg>
<seg id="14">Seventy-five Starbucks cafes now offer "evening" menus that include beer, wine, and small snacks.</seg>
<seg id="15">Ten thousand out of Chipotle's roughly 1,900 restaurants offer alcoholic beverages.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another Taco Bell Cantina location will be opened in San Francisco near AT&T Park later this month, according to the company, eschewing a drive-thru and parking lot for a patio and a pickup window.</seg>
<seg id="17">Those changes in location, atmosphere, and additions all point to the fast food chain aiming to attract a clientele beyond those looking for late night junk food.</seg>
<seg id="18">Taco Bell first set its sights on a higher quality food line in 2012, when it unveiled pricier Cantina bowls and burritos to compete with Chipotle, along with an accompanying ad campaign focusing on the new items' protein content.</seg>
<seg id="19">If successful, the Cantina locations will be yet another step in that upscale push.</seg>
<seg id="20">Taco Bell said it plans to add 2,000 locations in the US by 2022.</seg>
<seg id="21">Ms. Sandland told the AP, "several hundred" of them will be "Cantinas."</seg>

<seg id="1">They have heated up their phones in the middle of the night: Elton John courts Putin</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin telephoned Elton John on Monday night, just days after the British artist said publicly that he wants to meet the Russian politician to talk together about the Russian antigay legislation.</seg>
<seg id="3">The British singer, a declared homosexual, tried unsuccessfully to obtain a meeting with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, a year after he defied the protests in this country and held two concerts in 2013 in a hectic period in the history of this state, after the adoption of controversial laws which ban "homosexual propaganda" among minors.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2014 in St. Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and stated the following in front of his fans: "Although I'm gay, I always felt that I am welcomed here in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="5">If I were not honest about what I am, I could not write these songs.</seg>
<seg id="6">They do not mean gay propaganda.</seg>
<seg id="7">They represent the way I express life.</seg>
<seg id="8">If we begin to punish people for this, then the world will lose its humanity.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last Saturday, the artist revealed that he wants to meet with Putin to discuss this controversial issue.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cocos confessed everything in the National Authority for Property Restoration (NAPR) file</seg>
<seg id="2">Businessman Dorin Cocos is trying to save himself from a stinging conviction, by "singing" everything to the judges and detailing how he gave millions of euros to the former members of NAPR Commission.</seg>
<seg id="3">Interviewed yesterday before the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the case in which he is being prosecuted together with his son Alin Cocos, the former head of the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism Alina Bica and former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Compensation within NAPR, Dorin Cocos seemed to have been hit by the lightning of sincerity.</seg>
<seg id="4">He admitted all the allegations and told in detail to the judges how he helped businessman Stelian Gheorghe in the NAPR Compensation case, while asking instead to be judged more quickly and that his cooperation be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="5">Cocos stated that he has known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he befriended him after several real estate businesses.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that he met Sergiu Diacomatu in 2010 who told him he worked for NAPR.</seg>
<seg id="7">Later I learned that (Diacomatu, n.r). is the vice president, and due to the fact that Stelian Gheorghe has a file pending at NAPR, I asked him to help us.</seg>
<seg id="8">I promised him money, 2.5 million Euro, money that I said I will give in several instalments.</seg>
<seg id="9">I also promised him political support to remain in office.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Diacomatu told me then that he will help me, but that he needs support," said Dorin Cocos in the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="11">He stated that after this, through an acquaintance, he came into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then head of the Central Commission for Compensations, to whom he promised 800,000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the second case of Gheorghe Stelian, I knew that he wanted to get more than 300,000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="13">Diacomatu already had political support, I also gave him five million Euro.</seg>
<seg id="14">To Crinuta Dumitrean one million Euro, to Bogdan Dragos I gave 800,000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="15">Please note that I gave all this money in instalments to make sure that the case will be settled.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I only told them the following: solve the case, give compensations," said Cocos.</seg>
<seg id="17">Asked why he came to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million Euro for the positive settlement of the second case of Gheorghe Stelian.</seg>
<seg id="18">I received for the second case eight million euros to solve the problem, but I was left with only 1.2 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 2013 I also met Alina Bica.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We never talked about money or lands" said Cocos.</seg>
<seg id="21">He also said that "it was a known fact that all NAPR members agreed upon before the meeting."</seg>
<seg id="22">I was not nervous about them giving a positive vote.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the NAPR positions were given politically, but I personally did not help Diacomatu politically.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I told him I would help him politically only to calm him", concluded Cocos.</seg>

<seg id="2">Prime Minister Victor Ponta went to DNA yesterday for just five minutes, during which he submitted new documents in the file "Turceni - Rovinari".</seg>
<seg id="3">Victor Ponta ran to DNA with a document of the European Court of Justice</seg>
<seg id="4">Convinced that the case prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the file in which he is being investigated for forgery under private signature, complicity to tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went on his own initiative to DNA, although the documents he had could have been sent though a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was not to be, as the prosecutor had no time and the Prime Minister left after five minutes, during which he left several documents at the Register's Office.</seg>
<seg id="6">I wanted to submit (to the case, n.r) the resolution of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, which explains what happens to service contracts.</seg>
<seg id="7">I say I performed works, the prosecutor says I did not, the European Court of Justice told us we should both mind our business because as long the taxes were paid, things are alright.</seg>
<seg id="8">"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory and certain for all European Union countries, there is no case here," said Prime Minister Victor Ponta, when he exited DNA.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ponta also said that, in his view, the European Court's decision should apply, if we are EU members.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until then, the Prime Minister expects the prosecutor to read the European Court's decision and to call him again for questioning, but also to give him a response to his demands, including the splitting of the file.</seg>

<seg id="1">Iohannis is relishing his mandate without a TV</seg>
<seg id="2">In today's Romania, there is no legal provision which forces you to watch television.</seg>
<seg id="3">Not even to own such a device, since the television fee is added to the energy bill.</seg>
<seg id="4">But if you're the president, things change radically.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is due to the fact that it is basically implied that the Romanian president's job description states the president is up to date with everyday realities.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each day, president Iohannis immerses himself in total silence in his office at Cotroceni</seg>
<seg id="7">But, to the amazement of even the closest of his people at the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Iohannis refuses to have a TV in the presidential office.</seg>
<seg id="8">Even after failing to watching TV - any program, even German networks like RTL or Pro Sieben - the president also does not listen to any radio stations or read any newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, he does not even receive the "negative monitoring" for example. His predecessor requested it as a priority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Instead, Iohannis only enjoys receiving the news reports which put him in a positive light.</seg>
<seg id="11">Beside this informational self-isolation, in which the only break is when he accesses Facebook, even more serious is the blockage the president is pushing the overall activity of the Presidential Administration towards, by being passive.</seg>
<seg id="12">This happened because, although a lot of time has passed from the moment he was brought into service, Iohannis has yet to sign the loyalty statements for more than half of the employees of the Presidential Administration.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is becoming a growing problem, both in terms of human and legal standpoints.</seg>
<seg id="14">All is quiet and peaceful</seg>
<seg id="15">The presidential entourage is already convinced that nobody and nothing can damage the "feng shui" of the presidential office.</seg>
<seg id="16">A place of peace and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="17">It's true that just after a minute to nine (no more, no less!) in the morning, the former mayor of Sibiu requires the presence of the officials.</seg>
<seg id="18">This custom probably remained from the days when he was the mayor of the town near the Cibin river.</seg>
<seg id="19">The fact that Iohannis does not want a television in his office has already given rise to countless legends, thus people in the Cotroceni Palace already tend to think that, by doing so, the president is trying avoid being monitored.</seg>
<seg id="20">Especially since he does not own any radios.</seg>
<seg id="21">But, at this rate, the next step is to meditate in the dark, because even the illuminating equipment can hide audio-video recording devices.</seg>
<seg id="22">All is good</seg>
<seg id="23">Furthermore, another oddity at the Cotroceni Palace is that only the "positive monitoring" regarding the president is delivered to the him.</seg>
<seg id="24">That is, if there is any good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the president will receive the information on his desk.</seg>
<seg id="25">Good news or no news!</seg>
<seg id="26">Even more interesting is that "negative monitoring" is forbidden, given that, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only for watching late night television shows he was criticized in, but asking that every morning the bad news be delivered with priority.</seg>
<seg id="27">That does not necessarily mean this was of any help, but, as they say, the gesture counts!</seg>
<seg id="28">At least no one can ever say he was not well informed from alternative sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">Neither fired nor confirmed</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, maybe the mystery of why Klaus Iohannis does not want to watch TV is going to be solved.</seg>
<seg id="31">Until then, the resolution of the contractual situation of hundreds of employees from the presidential administration would be more important, irrespective of how it may be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="32">In order to work, the employees are required to sign a statement of loyalty to the president in office, which must also bear his signature.</seg>
<seg id="33">But, since December and until now, Klaus Iohannis has yet to sign for confirmation even half of these statements, although this was supposed to be done within 30 days.</seg>
<seg id="34">So hundreds of people representing over half of the staff at the Cotroceni Palace are in an uncertain situation now.</seg>
<seg id="35">Legally speaking, if the president does not personally sign their statement, they should be fired.</seg>
<seg id="36">The thing is that all these employees did not received any negative opinion either!</seg>
<seg id="37">So, after all, after the inspectors of the Court of Auditors will carry out an investigation, they will find that for over half a year, many hundreds of people have received their wages sailing close to the wind.</seg>
<seg id="38">That is until the president decides if he is going to fire them or confirm their positions, the decision being strictly his own.</seg>

<seg id="2">A teenager's ISIS-inspired plot to attack Pope Francis during his U.S. visit was more "aspirational" than operational, a law enforcement source confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 15-year-old was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August, when law enforcement authorities foiled the plot.</seg>
<seg id="4">The plot is the same one Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, the Homeland Security chairman, referred to during an interview on Sunday, a source told Fox News.</seg>

<seg id="9">The teen may suffer from mental health issues, a law enforcement source told Fox News, though the source wouldn't detail specifics about the teen's condition.</seg>
<seg id="10">McCaul on Sunday also acknowledged the potential for a so-called "lone wolf" attack nationwide and said he was briefed by the Secret Service "in a classified setting" about the pope's visit.</seg>

<seg id="2">Archaeologists in Ireland have unearthed startling details about the strange medieval skeleton found in the roots of a 215 year-old tree.</seg>
<seg id="3">The beech tree in Collooney, Sligo, fell during a storm earlier this year, revealing the macabre sight of a skeleton trapped in its roots.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Irish National Monuments Service brought in experts from Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to excavate and analyze the remains, revealing a grisly tale.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He had been killed violently," Marion Dowd, director of Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, told FoxNews.com.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have stab wounds in the upper chest and they were inflicted by a knife - we also have a stab wound in the left hand, which suggests that he was trying to defend himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">The skeleton is of a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.</seg>
<seg id="8">Radiocarbon analysis has dated the remains to between 900 and 1,000 years old.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We don't know if he was killed in a battle or if this was a personal dispute," said Dowd, noting that the body was originally buried in a Christian fashion with its head pointing to the west.</seg>
<seg id="10">"His family or community must have buried him," she added.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dowd told FoxNews.com that whoever planted the tree was unaware of the grave.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's completely coincidental - the context is unusual," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are historical records that say there was a church and graveyard in the area, but there are no remains visible today.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another aspect of the excavation is unusual - the young man's height.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He's 5-foot-10," said Dowd.</seg>
<seg id="16">For early medieval society that's pretty tall.</seg>

<seg id="2">The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has spent nearly $1.5 million studying how infants think about food.</seg>
<seg id="3">The project, "Infants' and Children's Reasoning About Foods," is being conducted by the University of Chicago and so far has determined that young children would rather not eat food that someone has licked or sneezed on.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Good nutrition is important for health and longevity, yet many Americans do not consume nutritionally sound diets," according to the grant for the project.</seg>
<seg id="5">Evidence suggests that infants' and children's earliest patterns of eating have lasting consequences for health across the lifespan.</seg>
<seg id="6">The premise for the study is that there is a dearth of research about how babies think about eating.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Despite the complexity and significance of food selection, developmental psychologists have devoted surprisingly little attention to studying how infants and children perceive, learn, and reason about foods," the grant said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The current proposal employs methods from cognitive development to test social influences on infants' and children's food choices and consumption.</seg>
<seg id="9">The researchers characterize infants as having "limited knowledge in the food domain."</seg>
<seg id="10">Children aged three to six years old are "more knowledgeable than infants and toddlers about foods" but are "notoriously picky eaters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Super boss: six women on juggling motherhood and work</seg>
<seg id="2">In the United States, unlike any other country in the world except Papua New Guinea, a centralized paid maternity leave policy does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="3">Two weeks ago, when Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer announced she was pregnant with twins but would be taking very limited maternity leave and "working throughout" her time off, the 40-year-old was widely criticized for propagating a culture which expects superwomanhood or nothing.</seg>
<seg id="4">But is Mayer, herself the epitome of a woman at the top, to blame for unrealistic expectations?</seg>
<seg id="5">How are other women leaders coping?</seg>
<seg id="6">Seema Patel, a lawyer and deputy director of San Francisco's Office of Labor Standards Enforcement, was taking her first steps at a government job in Washington DC a few years ago when her then boss sat her down with an unexpected piece of advice.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I don't know anything about you," her boss said.</seg>
<seg id="8">But if you have any plans to have a family in the future, start saving your leave right now.</seg>
<seg id="9">Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't get a day of paid maternity leave as part of her work arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="10">Back then, Patel was unmarried and very career-focused, and a family was the last thing on her mind.</seg>
<seg id="11">But diligently, she took her boss's word for it.</seg>
<seg id="12">She avoided using her sick days over the course of four years so that when she eventually did have her first child two years ago, she had accumulated enough to get three months paid time off.</seg>
<seg id="13">When she had her second baby six months ago, Patel could not pull the same trick.</seg>
<seg id="14">The four months she took off were entirely unpaid.</seg>
<seg id="15">Patel says she experienced no pushback from colleagues, but it is the work structure she has an issue with.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I find it extremely unsupportive for anyone trying to have family," she says.</seg>
<seg id="17">It sends a message: your country does not value you becoming a parent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Karen Choi, a vice-president at asset management firm Capital Group, says that any working woman who is a mother should be applauded.</seg>
<seg id="19">Choi, who has four children including a six-month-old baby, describes juggling being a mother and a job "a constant struggle."</seg>
<seg id="20">Secrets for keeping your head above water include having an "unbelievably supportive family" as well as a nanny and babysitter, accepting that there are some areas you are not going to be the best at ("Not everyone can be the Martha of home décor"), and simply getting through it.</seg>
<seg id="21">Choi says she took more maternity leave with every child she had, starting with two and a half months with her first child, and taking six months off with her latest.</seg>
<seg id="22">This makes her an exception, especially within her industry.</seg>
<seg id="23">When your child is sick, has fever, is throwing up and you are up all night taking care of your child and knowing that the next morning you have to get your other kids to school and then you have to go to work ...</seg>
<seg id="24">That's when it gets to be very challenging," she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her firm was supportive, though, and she stresses her investment portfolio's performance did not suffer at all.</seg>
<seg id="26">When she entered the finance industry after university, about 20 or so of her female college mates chose the same path, she says.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today about 90% of them have left.</seg>
<seg id="28">Women who exit jobs and then re-enter are likely to no longer be on track for peak earning positions, she says.</seg>
<seg id="29">Staying is tough: "A sacrifice in the short term, but it pays in the long term."</seg>
<seg id="30">If nothing else, her children have helped provide meaning for this sacrifice, she says, because all four of her children are daughters.</seg>
<seg id="31">One of the things that keeps me going is the fact that I would like to be a role model to them.</seg>
<seg id="32">The notion of being a role model to her four children is also what drives 48-year-old research scientist and professor Kelly Posner.</seg>
<seg id="33">They know that their mom is out there literally helping to save lives.</seg>
<seg id="34">Posner, who is the founder and director of the Center for Suicide Risk Assessment at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "big goal" career-wise and achieve it.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is very important for women to believe that they can have a vision.</seg>
<seg id="36">Most women do not allow themselves to think that," she says.</seg>
<seg id="37">She once gave a presentation to 200 people, including government officials in Italy over a webinar while eight months pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="38">Technology has also helped, she says, with the ability to stop the car and take a call after picking her kids up, or to answer an email on the go.</seg>
<seg id="39">Juggling motherhood with a demanding career has been helped by an optimistic, problem-solving disposition, she says - an ability to get through things even when they feel impossible.</seg>
<seg id="40">Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33, the executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and a mother of two, says that only being able to make career and motherhood work together thanks to private networks of help - like nannies - is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="41">"You shouldn't have to get lucky or win the lottery to be able to succeed," she says, describing the systemic failure to support women and families - citing oppressively low wages, a flawed health care system and a lack of mandated paid maternity leave.</seg>
<seg id="42">"As a society, we are not taking care of each other," she says.</seg>
<seg id="43">We cannot even guarantee mothers who have just birthed a child to recuperate.</seg>
<seg id="44">Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while attending law school, gave birth to one of her children while she was on a fellowship.</seg>
<seg id="45">With a husband and offspring relying on the healthcare provided by the fellowship, the labor leader was only able to take two weeks maternity leave, she says, before returning to work.</seg>
<seg id="46">Lisa Mosko, a fashion stylist and mother of two, says fewer women would be leaving their professions if more societal support were available in the form of company daycares, keeping to agreed-on schedules, and accepting that good work does not mean overtime.</seg>
<seg id="47">On top of logistical constraints, Mosko says she has the added pressure of being in an industry where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of unsophisticated ("mom clothes" being among the worst insults).</seg>
<seg id="48">"Image is part of your job - it can make or break you," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="49">Mosko's "constant negotiation" of making her multiple roles work in harmony involves keeping to her chic appearance, beautiful handbag on hand - but sometimes having a toy or two fall out of them.</seg>

<seg id="58">Indeed Olatoye, who goes on runs with her girlfriends every morning that end at 6am ("cheaper than therapy"), is still nursing.</seg>
<seg id="59">On the job, she has tried to create an environment that is "parent-friendly," where coming in late because of a kid is fine, and answering emails does not have to be done from within the office walls.</seg>
<seg id="60">"The concept and notion of family has changed and is changing so much," Olatoye says.</seg>
<seg id="61">"The family is very different from what it was like 25, hell, 10 years ago," she says.</seg>
<seg id="62">It's the workplace that has to adapt.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian pranksters say they fooled Elton John with Putin call</seg>
<seg id="2">To cynics, it had seemed rather too good to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, to Sir Elton John, singer and LGBT campaigner, about gay rights.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unfortunately for John, it was, in fact, not true: despite an effusive Instagram post in which he thanked the Russian leader for having reached out to him on the issue, it swiftly became clear that, whoever had called him on Monday night, it had not been Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Kremlin had already denied all knowledge of the chat.</seg>
<seg id="5">And on Wednesday two famous Russian pranksters stepped forward to claim that they, not the president, had been the foreign voices at the end of the telephone.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We thought it wasn't likely that Putin would want to meet with him and call, at least not so quickly," said Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who said he had impersonated Putin while his co-prankster, Alexei "Lexus" Stolyarov, had posed as the president's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov.</seg>
<seg id="7">"But it turned out that Elton John was really waiting for this call, and so he immediately believed it really was a conversation with the people who we said we were," he told told newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.</seg>
<seg id="8">He said: "Thank you, you've made my day."</seg>
<seg id="9">This day and this conversation has been the most wonderful and lovely in my life.</seg>
<seg id="10">As if to complete John's embarrassment, the pair announced they would broadcast a recording of the conversation on Wednesday on a popular Russian late-night show.</seg>
<seg id="11">John's representatives have not commented on speculation of a hoax.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the root of the saga are comments that the singer made at the weekend, in which he called out Putin about his "ridiculous" attitude towards gay people while lobbying for LGBT rights in Kiev, criticising in particular a Russian law passed in 2013 which bans the spreading of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I'd love to meet him [Putin], I'd love to sit down and talk to him," John told the BBC, saying that, though the idea was "probably pie in the sky," it was nonetheless worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then, on Monday night, the singer elicited incredulity from some observers when he posted a social media message declaring that Putin had responded to his criticisms by picking up the phone.</seg>
<seg id="15">He was, he said, "looking forward to meeting him [the president] face-to-face to discuss LGBT equality in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="16">Alas for John, it was not Putin on the end of the line but Stolyarov and Krasnov, who have prank-called many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.</seg>
<seg id="17">Stolyarov, who speaks English well, had played Peskov and pretended to interpret for the two.</seg>
<seg id="18">When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov had told journalists on Tuesday that Putin would be "ready to meet with Elton John among others to give answers to all the questions that he might ask," but said that the Kremlin had not received any requests from the singer.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Kremlin had reason to question the Instagram post's authenticity, he added, "especially because it's not entirely grammatically correct in English."</seg>
<seg id="20">We don't think that Sir Elton John would have written so ungrammatically.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even before the Russian duo went public with their hoax, local media had been speculating that John had become the victim of a prank.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some people online had even identified Krasnov, who is known for fooling politicians with phone calls that he records and posts on his YouTube channel as Vovan222 as the culprit.</seg>
<seg id="23">Prank-calling public figures and then publishing the recordings has become something of a phenomenon in recent years in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="24">Stolyarov, who is often credited as the father of the genre, has developed a knack for pranking Ukrainian politicians.</seg>
<seg id="25">He has been interviewed over the phone on Ukrainian television impersonating Anton Gerashchenko, the outspoken adviser to the interior minister, Arsen Avakov.</seg>
<seg id="26">He played Gerashchenko so well that he spoke to the former Dnipropetrovsk governor Ihor Kolomoisky for more than six hours over several days last year.</seg>
<seg id="27">Krasnov first came to prominence after the parliamentary elections of 2011, which sparked a huge street protest movement after reports of widespread fraud.</seg>
<seg id="28">Pretending to be then president Dmitry Medvedev's aide, Arkady Dvorkovich, he convinced the electoral commission head, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to fire him.</seg>
<seg id="29">Besides numerous Russian celebrities, his victims have also included the former USSR president Mikhail Gorbachev, Kiev mayor and boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, and Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko, whom he tricked into apologising for his athletes" drunken behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Krasnov reportedly called the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, pretending to be the son of the ousted Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovych.</seg>
<seg id="31">He was so convincing that the caller on the other end, whose voice sounded like that of Lukashenko, offered asylum.</seg>
<seg id="32">John's initial statement that he wished to speak to Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="33">The St Petersburg lawmaker Vitaly Milonov, who helped inspire the gay "propaganda" law, told the Guardian that John should not distract Putin with such an "irrelevant topic" and that he was ready to meet the singer to explain Russia's position.</seg>
<seg id="34">The newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets held an online readers' poll in which 39% of respondents thought Putin and John should meet, while 22% said such a meeting would harm Putin's reputation.</seg>

<seg id="1">More people die from air pollution than Malaria and HIV/Aids, new study shows</seg>
<seg id="2">More than 3 million people a year are killed prematurely by outdoor air pollution, according to a landmark new study, more than malaria and HIV/Aids combined.</seg>
<seg id="3">Wood and coal burning for heating homes and cooking is the biggest cause, especially in Asia, but the research reveals a remarkably heavy toll from farming emissions in Europe and the US, where it is the leading cause of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="4">The report warns that, unless action is taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths every minute - will double by 2050.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This projection should sound alarm bells for public health agencies around the world," said environmental health expert Professor Michael Jerrett, at the University of California and who was not involved in the research.</seg>
<seg id="6">Most air pollution deaths are caused by tiny particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="7">These cause heart attacks and strokes, which account for three-quarters of the 3.3 million annual deaths, with lung cancer and respiratory diseases responsible for the rest.</seg>
<seg id="8">The work did not include the effect of indoor air pollution, from cooking fires for example, which is estimated to cause an additional 3.4 million deaths a year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new work, published in the journal Nature, is the first study to single out different outdoor air pollution sources and estimate the number of premature deaths they each cause, considering road traffic, fossil fuel power stations and other sources.</seg>
<seg id="10">The researchers used a detailed computer model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on different populations, including new information on how pollution affects people in China and India.</seg>
<seg id="11">A third of all premature deaths were the result of using smoky fuels such as wood and coal for heating homes or cooking and using dirty diesel generators for electricity, all well-known hazards.</seg>
<seg id="12">This domestic energy use causes half the 645,000 annual deaths in India and a third of the 1.4 million annual deaths in China.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the research found that agricultural emissions of ammonia had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld, at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany, who led the research.</seg>
<seg id="14">A fifth of all global deaths resulted from these emissions, which come mainly from cattle, chickens and pigs and from the over-use of fertiliser.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ammonia reacts with fumes from traffic and industry to produce tiny particles and is the largest cause of air pollution deaths in the eastern US, Japan and in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="16">"For London, agriculture is the main source," said Lelieveld.</seg>
<seg id="17">Across the UK, 48% of the premature deaths were ultimately the result of agricultural pollution.</seg>
<seg id="18">Traffic pollution was still important in developed countries, causing a fifth of deaths, despite crackdowns on dirty vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="19">It only caused 5% of deaths across the globe as a whole, but this is likely to rise as more cars take to the road in developing countries.</seg>
<seg id="20">Air pollution from power stations, mainly coal-burning plants, was significant globally, causing one in seven deaths.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is the biggest single factor in the US, causing a third of the 55,000 annual deaths, compared to 16% in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="22">Natural air pollution, mostly dust in arid regions, caused almost a fifth of global air pollution deaths.</seg>
<seg id="23">This source is a major factor in some dry countries, accounting for 92% of deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The overlap of high pollution and large populations takes a huge toll on public health, but little [was] known about the pollution sources that are responsible for premature deaths," said Jerrett.</seg>
<seg id="25">The results are surprising and potentially important for protecting public health globally.</seg>
<seg id="26">Currently it is assumed that all particulates are equally toxic.</seg>
<seg id="27">But if those from fuel burning are more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the proportion of premature deaths attributable to farming emissions would be lower.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even so, Jerrett said, "the finding is highly valuable ... because agriculture has generally not been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death, and because it suggests that much more attention needs to be paid to agricultural sources, by both scientists and policymakers."</seg>
<seg id="29">Dr Oliver Wild, an atmospheric scientist at Lancaster University in the UK said: "The study really brings home the need for air quality controls to avoid these additional deaths, particularly in heavily populated parts of Asia."</seg>

<seg id="1">A statement of Victor Ponta makes relations with Hungary even more tense</seg>
<seg id="2">Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying. The Romanian Prime Minister speaks of attitudes reminiscent of Nazism</seg>
<seg id="3">Relations with Hungary, already tensed after the announcement of the construction of a fence on the border with Romania, after the one on the Serbian border, saw a new depreciation following the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta. On Monday, he accused the authorities in Budapest of treating the refugees with violence and "marking" them with serial numbers".</seg>
<seg id="4">Hungarian diplomacy reacted harshly, talking about "extremist and false" statements. Victor Ponta strikes back and accuses the government officials of the neighbouring country to be "a disgrace" for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="5">It should be noted that this it is not the first time Ponta has tried to strain the Romanian-Hungarian relations through statements made in delicate or electoral moments.</seg>
<seg id="6">It all started in a statement made Monday by Victor Ponta, in which he tries to argue that Romania cannot receive more than 1,800 refugees.</seg>
<seg id="7">The problem is our logistical problem as we want to treat those people as people, not as our Hungarian neighbours treat them with violence, "marking" them with serial numbers.</seg>
<seg id="8">We do not agree with this.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Basescu was put in charge of an ugly horrible feeling which exists in all societies, namely a xenophobic sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's good to have debates, but the burden of solving the problem falls on us.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are going to treat those people like we would treat ourselves", said Victor Ponta on Monday, quoted by Adevarul.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not clear what Victor Ponta meant when he spoke of serial numbers, but the Czech Republic has recently been in the centre of criticism after writing numbers on the hands of the migrants in several trains, a gesture that recalled of the procedure used by the Nazis to identify the Hebrew prisoners in concentration camps.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the article of the MTI news agency and picked up by magyaridok.hu, Peter Szijjarto considered that the internal political crises which rocked Victor Ponta's position probably influenced him to make "extremist and false" declarations.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Romanian charge d'affaires in Budapest was summoned to give explanations, reports Mediafax, citing MTI.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inappropriate statements about how Hungary manages the immigrant crisis", says the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="16">Levente Magyar, Secretary of State for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed his "surprise" in connection with the "constant attempts of Victor Ponta to save his controversial moral position with anti-Hungary lies", emphasizes the diplomacy in Budapest .</seg>
<seg id="17">"I do NOT want to respond to the challenges of some Hungarian government representatives - but please read the story below and you will understand the outrage that I feel as a man and an European citizen, in the context of mentalities and attitudes which have beeen seen in Europe only in 1930-1940 !!!", wrote Ponta on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="18">He says that, like other European politicians, he has the "duty" to attract attention and sanction the "constant behaviour of Hungarian government officials of the highest level" who are "a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union" through their "anti-Semitic attitudes", " the way they treat all minorities and now the refugees crisis!"</seg>
<seg id="19">"Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutally will certainly not solve the problem - the only thing this behaviour accentuates is that in the heart of Europe, in Hungary there are policymakers who are no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees are fleeing!", accused Ponta, saying that he believes in "solidarity, rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values ". He also states that " what we have recently seen in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!".</seg>
<seg id="20">In the evening, Ponta was the guest of Antena 3, where the main topic was Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="21">If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if Hungarian soldiers would start firing or killing children and women, in a speech with several references to Nazism.</seg>
<seg id="22">The president of UDMR (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania), Kelemen Hunor, intervened in the debate . He considers that the Romanian authorities should not have an "emotional approach" in relation to Hungary's intention to build a fence on the border.</seg>
<seg id="23">The leader of UDMR said that what needs to be understood is that this solution is not directed against Romania and the Romanian citizens, stating that the fence might even help our country avoid becoming a route heavily transited by migrants who want to enter the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.</seg>
<seg id="24">Firstly, I want to emphasize, to state that we should not become hysterical, and take the whole issue as something against Romania and it should not be used to aggravate the not too good relations between the two governments, because it is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="25">I think any sentimental, visceral approach is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We need to see the rational side of the matter, see why did it come to this and we need to know how to say it. The fence is not against us, is not against Romania and the Romanian citizens and does not prevent free movement between the two countries, in the European Union", said Kelemen Hunor.</seg>

<seg id="1">The West ignored in 2012 Russia's offer to overthrow Bashar al-Assad from ruling Syria</seg>
<seg id="2">Russia has suggested more than three years ago the removal of President Bashar al-Assad, as part of a peace treaty, according to a senior official involved at that time in the closed door negotiations between Western countries and Russia, states The Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="3">The former president of Finland and Nobel Peace recipient, Martti Ahtisaari, said the Western powers did not take advantage of that proposal.</seg>
<seg id="4">From 2012 to present day, tens of thousands of people died and millions were forced to flee the country, creating the worst refugee crisis since the end of the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ahtisaari held discussions with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (US, UK, France, Russia and China) in February 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also said that during the discussions, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, offered a plan that included, among others, the proposal addresses to Assad to step down at some point after the start of the peace treaties between the regime and the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="7">He proposed three things:</seg>
<seg id="8">One - the opposition should not be armed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two - we must initiate a dialogue between Assad and the opposition immediately.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Three - we must find an elegant way for Assad to pull back," said Ahtisaari, recounting the Russian ambassador's position.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ahtisaari also said that the United States, Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator would fall, that they ignored the Russian Ambassador's proposal.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It was a missed opportunity in 2012," continued the former president of Finland.</seg>
<seg id="13">Officially, Russia firmly supported Bashar al-Assad over the four and a half years of war, insisting that its removal may not represent a proposal in any peace agreement.</seg>
<seg id="14">Assad believes that Russia will never abandon him.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moscow recently began sending troops, tanks and military fly machines in Syria, in an effort to stabilize the Assad regime and confront the Islamic State extremists.</seg>

<seg id="1">Marine wildlife populations have halved in the last 40 years, report finds</seg>
<seg id="2">The scale of the crisis facing the animals and plants of the sea is documented in detail by the study which claims that marine species around the world, including some that are critical to human food security, are in potentially catastrophic decline.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unprecedented pressures on the global ocean ecosystem from several directions are combining to create a perfect storm of difficulties for virtually everything that lives in the sea, says the WWF's Living Blue Planet report.</seg>
<seg id="4">Coral reefs are at serious risk of further decline (WWF) Some marine habitats such as mangroves and seagrasses, on which many other species depend, have seen significant declines, while whole populations of commercially valuable fish, such as mackerel and tuna, have plummeted by as much as three quarters since the 1970s, the report found.</seg>
<seg id="5">Many coral reefs, often described as the tropical rainforests of the oceans because of their rich diversity of life, could be threatened with extinction by mid-Century if ocean acidity continues to worsen as a result of rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere - which causes a corresponding rise in carbonic acid in the sea.</seg>
<seg id="6">"As well as being a source of extraordinary natural beauty and wonder, healthy seas are the bedrock of a functioning global economy," said Louise Heaps, chief advisor on marine policy at WWF-UK, who helped to compile the report.</seg>
<seg id="7">"By over-exploiting fisheries, degrading coastal habitats and not addressing global warming, we are sowing the seeds of ecological economic catastrophe," Dr Heaps said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report, based on a review of the published scientific literature as well as the Living Planet Index, a database maintained by the Zoological Society of London, is one of the most detailed surveys of marine wildlife ever undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nearly 20 per cent of total mangrove area has been lost between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It investigated a wide range of wildlife, from fish, marine turtles and sea cucumbers - a worm-like animal with leathery skin - to sea plants such as mangroves and sea grasses.</seg>
<seg id="10">The report found that seagrass coverage has declined by about 30 per cent over the past century while the total area covered by mangroves has dropped by 20 per cent between 1980 and 2005, primarily as a result of shrimp farming and other forms of aquaculture.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the space of a single generation, human activity has severely damaged the ocean by catching fish faster than they can reproduce while also destroying their nurseries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Profound changes a needed to ensure abundant ocean life for future generations," said Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the most dramatic declines have been in species fished for commercial gain.</seg>
<seg id="14">For instance, some 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the Scrombidae family - mackerels, tunas and sardines - have fallen by 74 per cent between 1970 and 2010, with no signs of recovery, the report says.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are in a race to catch fish that could end with people starved of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overfishing, destruction of marine habitats and climate change have dire consequences for the entire human population, with the poorest communities that rely on the sea getting hit fastest and hardest," Mr Lambertini said.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger serious economic decline and undermine our fight to eradicate poverty and malnutrition," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Professor Ken Norris, director of science at the ZL, said: "These devastating figures reveal how quickly human beings are changing the wildlife in our oceans and are a stark warning of the problems we might face as a result."</seg>
<seg id="19">Seagrasses: Vast underwater "meadows" that catch mineral-rich sediments and stabilise the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="20">Coverage has declined by 30 per cent over the past century.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mangroves: Known to exist in 123 countries, with almost half the coverage in just five nations.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nearly 20 per cent of total mangrove area has been lost between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human encroachment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Coral reefs: Some of the most biologically rich and productive habitats on earth.</seg>
<seg id="24">A quarter of all marine species live in or near coral reefs yet three quarters of them are currently threatened and many could be lost this century is ocean acidity continues to worsen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Deep-sea habitats: Little is known about the deeper parts of the ocean, but the decline in the number of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the past 40 years suggests they are also being affected by global changes to the sea.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steven Gerrard denies racism claims allegedly made by former Liverpool team-mate El-Hadji Diouf</seg>
<seg id="2">In an extract from his upcoming autobiography My Story, serialised by the Daily Mail, Gerrard criticises the Senegalese player for having "no real interest in football" and being the signing he "liked least" during his 17 years at the club.</seg>
<seg id="3">In retaliation, Diouf has been reported to have responded to Gerrard's words on Senegalese radio station Groupe Futurs Medias, with translated quotes attributed to the striker stating that "Gerrard has never liked black people."</seg>
<seg id="4">Gerrard's lawyers have moved to deny any claims he is racist.</seg>
<seg id="5">In his latest book, Gerrard, who has publicised his low opinion of Diouf before, criticised his former team-mate's attitude and professionalism.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I don't really want to waste time thinking about El Hadji Diouf but it's worth highlighting his wasted seasons at Liverpool as an example of how it can all go wrong," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It seemed to me that Diouf had no real interest in football and that he cared nothing about Liverpool," he continued.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, the way he spat a huge globule of gunky phlegm at a Celtic fan in a Uefa Cup match at Parkhead in March 2003 summed up his contemptuous and spiteful demeanour.</seg>
<seg id="9">Diouf proved to be controversial figure during his time at Anfield, with his most notorious night coming at Celtic Park.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Senegalese forward was interviewed by police after the spitting incident and fined two weeks wages by his club, with the £60,000 amount being donated to a charity of Celtic's choice.</seg>
<seg id="11">In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard described Diouf as a lazy and self-interested character.</seg>
<seg id="12">"His attitude was all wrong," Gerrard wrote at the time.</seg>
<seg id="13">I felt he wasn't really a***d about putting his body on the line to get Liverpool back at the top.</seg>
<seg id="14">Diouf, who now plays at Malaysian club Sabah, has also criticised Gerrard publicly in the past, as well as attacking Gerrard's long-standing friend and team-mate Jamie Carragher.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2012, Diouf called Gerrard 'egotistical' and claimed that nobody at Anfield likes player who led his side to Champions League victory in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="16">Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "jealous."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said: "Gerrard is just jealous of me.</seg>
<seg id="18">He hasn't achieved what I have done in football.</seg>
<seg id="19">When I came to Liverpool, I came up with the status of boss and he lives there.</seg>
<seg id="20">I am respected in world football, the greatest football experts have appointed me among the seven best players in the World Cup, the top 100 players of the century.</seg>
<seg id="21">Several big players do not belong.</seg>
<seg id="22">Everywhere I go out of my country, they worship me - while Gerrard will get abuse whenever he leaves his home city of Liverpool.</seg>

<seg id="10">The trio is credited with stopping what could have been a mass killing by a suspected terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="11">Skarlatos, a 22-year-old Army National Guardsman who grew up near Sacramento, has since received a call from President Obama, a Twitter shout-out from Donald Trump and a dinner date with Arnold Schwarzenegger, along with decorations from the U.S. military and the French government.</seg>
<seg id="12">Though he might've anticipated a few local accolades - there was a parade in the young men's honor in Sacramento on Friday -- he didn't expect the breadth of well wishes or the "Dancing With the Stars" invitation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Never in a million years did I think I'd get that offer," Skarlatos said Saturday during a break in dance practice with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's all brand new and crazy to me.</seg>
<seg id="15">While he admitted to being "a little nervous" before Monday night's show, he handled his first foxtrot like a professional, earning scores that put him near the top of the competitive heap.</seg>
<seg id="16">Judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough said he gave one of the standout performances of the night.</seg>
<seg id="17">Katz and "DWTS" executive producer Rob Wade said they like to keep a spot open on the show for last-minute contestants, such as Skarlatos, who have vaulted into the public eye.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation who tackled a shooter mid-attack on a 500-passenger train and immediately thought about getting one of them on the dance competition.</seg>
<seg id="19">She scoured social media, tracked down family members and started sending messages to Skarlatos.</seg>
<seg id="20">When he appeared on "Good Morning America" to discuss the incident, during which Stone and several other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the sister ABC program to cut through the media firestorm.</seg>
<seg id="21">She made her "five-minute elevator pitch," and then waited anxiously to learn if Skarlatos would agree to be on "DWTS."</seg>
<seg id="22">"It was touch-and-go there for a while because this is so out of his element," Katz said.</seg>
<seg id="23">He was just serving in Afghanistan not long ago, and now we're asking if he's ready to cha cha.</seg>
<seg id="24">Skarlatos, who's taking a short leave from the National Guard, hadn't even watched an entire episode of the show until recently.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was on the fence about participating, mainly because he didn't want to be singled out.</seg>
<seg id="26">The series couldn't accommodate all three friends.</seg>
<seg id="27">But producers had an ace-in-the-hole: Noah Galloway, a military vet and double amputee.</seg>
<seg id="28">They encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, fan favorite competitor and finalist from last season, and ask about his experience.</seg>
<seg id="29">That may have been the tipping point, along with Katz's relentless "stalking" and "psycho texting," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Noah's a great guy, and I wanted to know how the military would be portrayed and how my friends" images would be protected," Skarlatos said.</seg>
<seg id="31">He told me I should do it.</seg>
<seg id="32">So after that conversation, I said yes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Skarlatos, an avid sportsman and history buff, has never danced before, and Arnold has said in interviews that she's been trying to get him to loosen his rather stiff military posture.</seg>
<seg id="34">But Katz said she's confident he will adapt and that viewers will respond to him.</seg>
<seg id="35">He'll get so much love in the beginning because people are proud of him and what he's just done.</seg>
<seg id="36">"How can you not root for him?", Katz said.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that'll only last a few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="38">He'll have to dance to keep going.</seg>
<seg id="39">Skarlatos, who's single and plans eventually to become a police officer, said he's enjoyed himself so far in the completely unfamiliar arena.</seg>
<seg id="40">Scheduling has been the toughest battle, with frequent trips to Los Angeles between his media whistle-stop tour and various awards ceremonies.</seg>
<seg id="41">He'd said in late August, on returning to the U.S. just after the train takedown, that he wanted some R&R at home with his family.</seg>
<seg id="42">"That lasted about a day and a half," he said.</seg>
<seg id="43">I think I've been home about four days total.</seg>
<seg id="44">There's a risk in snagging a newsworthy person who isn't accustomed to being in the spotlight, executive producer Wade said.</seg>
<seg id="45">And the show wants to make sure the contestant can do well and have some fun.</seg>
<seg id="46">"This is a lot of pressure, and we want people to have a good experience," Wade said.</seg>
<seg id="47">"We'd never want Alek to say, "What have I gotten myself into?"</seg>
<seg id="48">Fingers crossed he has a good time.</seg>

<seg id="1">The McDonald's McRib is back.</seg>
<seg id="2">For those who wait all year for the pork patty shaped like a mini rack of ribs, here's your chance to go nuts.</seg>
<seg id="3">But is it harder to find this year?</seg>
<seg id="4">CNBC is reporting that only 55% of the McDonald's franchises in the country are offering the seasonal special.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last year, 75% of the restaurants served the McRib.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For the 2015 McRib promotion there are nearly 8,000 participating restaurants," McDonald's spokesperson Lisa McComb told The Times in an email.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are a little more than 14,300 locations of the fast-food restaurant in the U.S.</seg>
<seg id="8">But according to McComb, it's the individual franchise owners who decide on serving the McRib or not.</seg>
<seg id="9">"This participation isn't significantly different than last year," said McComb.</seg>
<seg id="10">Owner/operators are free to offer the menu items they feel their local customers will want.</seg>
<seg id="11">And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's attempted to explain its ingredients last year with a mythbuster video.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the video, the McRib patty is made with pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The sandwich will be available at participating McDonald's locations through the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="14">There's also a McRib locator website (not affiliated with McDonald's), that can help.</seg>
<seg id="15">People can report McRib sightings on the website and look for the sandwich near them.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, a quick search on the website shows the nearest McRib to Los Angeles is in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, spotted last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sometimes, I just can't fight the craving for BBQ chicken pizza.</seg>

<seg id="2">Keith Richards is back in the spotlight with a new solo album and documentary feature, but soon the rest of the Rolling Stones might be joining him in the studio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Richards announced that he and the rest of the Stones -- Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood -- recently met up in London and made, as he put it, "definite plans to record."</seg>
<seg id="4">Richards was speaking as part of the iHeartRadio ICONS series with interviewer Jim Kerr on Tuesday night.</seg>
<seg id="5">A potential new Stones album would be the group's first LP since 2005's "A Bigger Bang."</seg>
<seg id="6">But the band has been far from idle.</seg>
<seg id="7">They've toured stadiums extensively in recent years, and played several small shows around L.A., including stops at the Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the latter, they revisited their 1971 classic LP "Sticky Fingers."</seg>
<seg id="9">Richards has been particularly busy this year, collaborating on a documentary feature "Keith Richards: Under the Influence" scheduled for a Sept. 18 release on Netflix.</seg>
<seg id="10">This year he also released a solo album "Crosseyed Heart," his third solo outing in a five-decade career.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Times' Randy Lewis described Richards' new album in an early interview with the guitarist: "As always, Richards' ragged voice is an instrument that's more serviceable than distinguished...."</seg>
<seg id="12">Yet Richards gets emotions across in the album's 15 songs, and that's always been what rock 'n' roll is about.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the interview, Richards said that the band will likely get into the studio after a South American tour early next year.</seg>
<seg id="14">He didn't offer other details, but judging by their recent shows the band still has plenty of life left in it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman on childhood, adulthood and 'The Family Fang'</seg>
<seg id="2">Jason Bateman has already navigated a few tricky transitions in his career with a low-key charm that has made it look far easier than it must have actually been.</seg>
<seg id="3">Once a child actor on such television shows as "Silver Spoons," as an adult he reemerged as a deadpan everyman on TV's "Arrested Development" and in films such as "Horrible Bosses."</seg>
<seg id="4">His first film as director was the very acerbic comedy "Bad Words," in which he also starred.</seg>
<seg id="5">The film was picked up out of the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bateman was back in Toronto earlier this week with his second film as director, the tonally ambitious "The Family Fang," an adaption of Kevin Wilson's popular 2011 novel with a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize winner David Lindsay-Abaire and starring Nicole Kidman alongside Bateman as troubled siblings.</seg>
<seg id="7">The film is playing the festival looking for U.S. distribution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many notices for the book pinned it as a comedy with deeper emotional currents; the film recasts the story somewhat by emphasizing its darker, more dramatic heft.</seg>
<seg id="9">In an interview here Tuesday, Bateman said he always saw the material as more dramatic than comedic.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I never read the book in that way," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">From the book, the subject matter and themes were always very dramatic and very human.</seg>
<seg id="12">I thought that Kevin was addressing something that was pretty emotional in a very entertaining way.</seg>
<seg id="13">So that was always the order that I saw things, a drama that had some moments of levity and comedy and eccentricity.</seg>
<seg id="14">Monday night's world premiere screening was introduced by the festival's director of programming, Kerri Craddock, who expressed particular enthusiasm for Bateman's late-'80s/early-'90s sitcom "The Hogan Family" -- "I haven't met a lot of "Hogan Family" fans," Bateman noted dryly when he came onstage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Yet it was directing a few episodes of that show that got Bateman, now 46, into the Director's Guild at the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="16">The story of his new film revolves around a family with the last name of Fang.</seg>
<seg id="17">The parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are performance artists of moderate reputation, best known for the way in which they used their children Annie and Baxter in their pieces, such as staging a bank robbery over lollipops or being purposefully terrible street musicians.</seg>
<seg id="18">Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) have subsequently struggled to find their own identities in adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="19">Annie is an actress of some notoriety, though as much for her public meltdowns as her performances, while Baxter is a struggling novelist and magazine journalist.</seg>
<seg id="20">When Caleb and Camille disappear under mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter are suspicious that this is just another stunt, and they set about trying to discover the truth about their parents and find out some new truths about themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is perhaps not difficult to see what in that storyline of child performers moving forward with their adult lives may have spoken directly and deeply to Bateman.</seg>
<seg id="22">"My upbringing as a child was very atypical," Bateman said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Started acting when I was 10, my parents being my manager, there's a lot of overlap in this film from the way in which I was brought up.</seg>
<seg id="24">So this was something I certainly didn't see as some kind of surface piece of entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It's something I had a full connection to and a deep understanding of," he added, "and although I didn't try to drag any of my own personal baggage into it, I certainly had a clear idea of what a version of this film might look and feel like if it were to represent children who had a nontraditional upbringing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The project began with Kidman, also a producer on the film, acquiring the rights to Wilson's book.</seg>
<seg id="27">When Wilson declined to write the adaption himself, Lindsay-Abaire, who adapted his own "Rabbit Hole," which Kidman starred in, was brought on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Bateman, as he says, raised his hand for the chance to direct and costar.</seg>
<seg id="29">(Kidman, currently onstage in London in a production of "Photograph 51," was not in attendance at Monday's premiere.</seg>
<seg id="30">The book's author was among those in the audience.)</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's film a "smart, tart adaptation" that "thumbs its nose at the clichés of the over-trafficked dysfunctional family genre to dissect the sometimes lifelong quest of children to understand their parents in ways that are funny and bittersweet, poignant and often bracingly dark."</seg>
<seg id="32">In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a sharply drawn portrait" and that Bateman "shows marked progress and deepening maturity as a filmmaker with this cleverly structured but never arch or mechanical adaptation."</seg>
<seg id="33">After the film on Monday, as Bateman and Walken stepped onstage for a Q&A, there was a standing ovation for the much-beloved Walken.</seg>
<seg id="34">Of observing Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the Q&A that "I was impressed every day.</seg>
<seg id="35">I couldn't believe it, the ease with which he went back and forth between directing the movie, which is a handful, and playing the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="36">His focus and concentration, really, it's amazing.</seg>
<seg id="37">In one dialogue scene in particular, Bateman stands on a staircase in the family home in the back of the frame, obscured in darkness, just a shadow in profile, while Kidman is closer to the camera and seen more clearly.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor debating with Bateman the director over the fact he can't be seen.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Directing films is incredibly exciting to me," Bateman said.</seg>
<seg id="40">All my decisions come from that place, it's never to serve me as an actor.</seg>
<seg id="41">To have the privileged position of being the guy who is responsible for shaping the entire experience for an audience as opposed to being just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, it's all-encompassing.</seg>
<seg id="42">Regardless of whether that ... actor wants a close-up.</seg>
<seg id="43">Bateman said in the Q&A that when he read the script, he immediately thought of Walken to play the part of Caleb, but also that he hoped for composer Carter Burwell for the score.</seg>
<seg id="44">Best known for his long-standing relationship with the Coen brothers, Burwell also scored two other films at the Toronto festival, Charlie Kaufman's and Duke Johnson's stop-motion-animation story of love and isolation, "Anomalisa," and Brian Helgeland's telling of the 1960s English gangster twins Ronnie and Reggie Kray in "Legend."</seg>
<seg id="45">Burwell composed the score for Todd Haynes" upcoming "Carol" as well.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Things that have an oblong or obtuse tone are very interesting to me," Bateman said, expanding on the idea on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="47">Navigating those tones and delivering an audience, hopefully seamlessly, somewhat elegantly, from one tone to the next throughout the film.</seg>
<seg id="48">Carter has made a career and an incredible reputation as somebody who can navigate the most complicated of tones.</seg>
<seg id="49">Both as director and actor, with "The Family Fang," Bateman has taken another bold step in a career that is full of self-aware reinvention and determination, a mix of comedy and drama, lightness and dark.</seg>
<seg id="50">As Bateman said while finishing his introduction to the film at Monday's world premiere, "It turned out exactly the way I wanted it to, for better or worse."</seg>

<seg id="2">Bulgaria is a transit country for the illicit trafficking of stolen cultural goods from the Middle East due to its key geographic location, according to Interior Minister Rumyana Bachvarova.</seg>
<seg id="3">Speaking Wednesday at a conference on the fight against looting of Syria's cultural heritage, Bachvarova reminded that Bulgaria's national legislation had been adjusted to the new circumstances, featuring an emphasis on the ban on cross-border trade from Syria and Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bachvarova, as cited by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency (BTA), stated that the efforts of the competent units of the Interior Ministry and most of all the Chief Directorate "Combating Organized Crime" (GDBOP) were focused on preventing the illegal smuggling and sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.</seg>
<seg id="5">She declared that Bulgaria was a country with a rich history, with recent surveys placing it third, after Italy and Greece, by trafficking of cultural goods and objects.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bulgaria's Interior Minister said that the trafficking in cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites located in zones such as Iraq and Syria was a phenomenon that was gaining momentum and was described as an exceptionally serious war crime.</seg>
<seg id="7">She insisted that concerted and decisiove actions were necessary to stop the ongoing deliberate destruction of history.</seg>
<seg id="8">UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova noted that footage of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria showed that the country was plagued by industrial scale looting.</seg>

<seg id="1">Aerojet Rocketdyne says new AR-1 engine timetable could slip</seg>
<seg id="2">Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc on Tuesday said it expected to complete its new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a soon-to-be banned Russian engine, but the date could slip if it does not receive enough U.S. government funding.</seg>
<seg id="3">Aerojet Vice President Julie Van Kleeck declined comment on reports that Aerojet has offered $2 billion to acquire United Launch Alliance (ULA), a 50-50 rocket launch venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.</seg>
<seg id="4">Analysts say the bid is a strategic move by Aerojet to shut out rival Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, that is developing a new engine favored by ULA for use in its new Vulcan rocket.</seg>
<seg id="5">ULA has said Blue Origin's engine program is about two years ahead of Aerojet's work on the AR-1 engine, a claim Aerojet disputes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Work on the new engines gained urgency after U.S. lawmakers passed a ban on use of Russian RD-180 engines for launches of U.S. military or spy satellites following Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Van Kleeck said the company was testing hardware for the engine, which is being designed with 3D-printed parts to fit into both ULA's Atlas 5 rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and the new Vulcan rocket that ULA is developing at a cost of about $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">Aerojet says it would be less costly and risky to integrate its engine into the Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a wholly new engine and rocket, as ULA currently plans.</seg>
<seg id="9">Van Kleeck said Aerojet planned to begin testing full scale engines in 2017, followed by certification in 2019, but the date could slip if the company did not receive enough funding from the Air Force in contract awards expected late in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which begins Oct.</seg>
<seg id="10">She said the company was eager to see how the Air Force split funding of about $160 million among rival bidders.</seg>
<seg id="11">She said Aerojet was also exploring other private funding options for the engine but gave no details.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Air Force competition is a public-private partnership, with each of the bidders asked to provide one-third of the funding, with the Air Force to provide a two-thirds share.</seg>
<seg id="13">Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both of which are privately held, have self-funded their engine work, and say they are not necessarily looking for government funding.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brewer AB InBev seeks $275 billion tie-up with SABMiller</seg>
<seg id="2">Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world's largest brewer, has approached rival SABMiller (SAB.L) about a takeover that would form a colossus producing a third of the world's beer.</seg>
<seg id="3">A merged group would have a market value of around $275 billion at current prices, and would combine AB InBev's dominance of Latin America with SABMiller's of Africa, both fast-growing markets, as well as their breweries in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev has no presence, as well as some add-ons in Asia and Latin America," said Societe Generale analyst Andrew Holland.</seg>
<seg id="5">AB InBev and other top brewers are trying to move into new markets as they look to shrug off weakness in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly choose craft beers made by independent players or wine or spirits.</seg>
<seg id="6">SABMiller, the world number two and maker of more than 200 beers including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday it had been informed that AB InBev intended to make an offer which it would have to do by Oct. 14 under British rules.</seg>
<seg id="7">AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private equity fund run by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed its approach.</seg>
<seg id="8">3G, known for its focus on cost cuts at the expense of marketing, has previously orchestrated takeovers of Burger King, ketchup maker Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.</seg>
<seg id="9">A source close to SAB said it was too early to say what it would do since no offer has been made.</seg>
<seg id="10">"At this stage, we're in wait and see mode," said the source.</seg>
<seg id="11">Speculation about a merger, likely to raise antitrust concerns in markets such as the United States and China, has swirled for years.</seg>
<seg id="12">The timing of the approach, after more than a decade of acquisitions by AB InBev, follows a roughly 15 percent drop in SABMiller's share price since August.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's exactly the moment they've been waiting for," said Morningstar analyst Phil Gorham.</seg>
<seg id="14">It makes sense financially for the first time in years.</seg>
<seg id="15">AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds ($62) per SAB Miller share, and maybe as much as 45 pounds, according to analysts - implying an overall price of up to $130 billion, including SABMiller's debt.</seg>
<seg id="16">That would make it the biggest M&A deal of 2015, already shaping up to be a record year since the 2008 financial crisis in terms of deal volume, and one the five largest takeovers since 1980.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shares in SAB closed up 19.9 percent at 36.14 pounds, giving it a market capitalization of $90 billion.</seg>
<seg id="18">AB InBev's were up 6.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rivals Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) also rose on speculation SAB might seek another merger as a defence strategy, as it did last year when it offered to buy Heineken, but was rebuffed.</seg>
<seg id="20">Since then it has combined its African soft drink bottler with that of Coca-Cola (KO.N), and in recent weeks there has been speculation about it combining with Diageo or Australian drinks firm Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).</seg>
<seg id="21">The global beer market share of AB InBev, maker of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1 percent in 2014, while SABMiller's was 15 percent, according to industry experts Plato Logic.</seg>
<seg id="22">AB InBev's target for its net debt to core profit (EBITDA) ratio is 2 times, from around 2.5 currently.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is likely to reach that by 2016, the earliest any deal could realistically be completed, and so has room to borrow to fund any takeover.</seg>
<seg id="24">When it bought Budweiser-maker Anheuser-Busch in 2008 for $52 billion, the largest cash takeover in history at the time, it let the ratio rise to beyond 5 times.</seg>
<seg id="25">Going that high again might allow it to raise as much as $100 billion in debt.</seg>
<seg id="26">AB InBev's controlling families own just over half of the company, while SABMiller's two top shareholders are cigarette maker Altria (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="27">Altria on Wednesday declined comment on the AB InBev approach, but on Sept. 9, its CFO Billy Gifford said at an analyst conference that it regularly evaluates its SABMiller investment "and at this time we believe maintaining the asset is in our shareholders' best interests."</seg>
<seg id="28">The Santo Domingo family could not immediately be reached for comment.</seg>
<seg id="29">Neil Dwane, European chief investment officer, equity, at Allianz Global Investors, which holds shares in both companies, said AB InBev had faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="30">ABI is paying a high price but accretion to earnings from low debt costs would be something in the region of 15 percent.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, we think the return on this deal could be a relatively disappointing 8 percent after 10 years," Dwane said.</seg>
<seg id="32">There are significant antitrust hurdles to any combination, particularly in the United States, where the companies would have about 70 percent of the beer market.</seg>
<seg id="33">"The costs that could be saved in the distribution operations are high - and the antitrust hurdles are higher," said Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.</seg>
<seg id="34">A deal would allow Molson Coors to acquire the 58 percent of the joint venture owned by SABMiller according to the operating agreement that governs it.</seg>
<seg id="35">A change in control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to acquire an additional 8 percent and name a new CEO at the venture.</seg>
<seg id="36">Denver-based Molson would also have the right of first and last offer for the remaining 50 percent stake.</seg>
<seg id="37">A Molson spokesman declined to comment on whether the company would be interested in a bid, but Molson shares surged more than 12 percent to an all-time high.</seg>
<seg id="38">Any merged group may also have to sell interests in China, where SABMiller's CR Snow joint venture with China Resources (0291.HK) is the market leader.</seg>
<seg id="39">Heineken, Carlsberg or China's Tsingtao could be potential buyers.</seg>
<seg id="40">Plato estimates that after disposals, the combined group could end up with a 28 percent global market share.</seg>
<seg id="41">AB InBev is being advised by Lazard, while SABMiller is being advised by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.</seg>

<seg id="2">Pakistani police have arrested a former Air Force pilot who later donated funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, police told Reuters on Wednesday, in a rare case targeting those who financially contribute to militancy.</seg>
<seg id="3">The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern city of Karachi.</seg>
<seg id="4">He paid for the treatment of injured Taliban militants at a hospital in the eastern city of Lahore, police said.</seg>
<seg id="5">He also influenced two militants involved in an attack on a busload of minority Shi'ite Ismaili Muslims in May that killed 45 people, senior police officer Naveed Khawaja from the provincial Counter Terrorism Department told journalists.</seg>
<seg id="6">He will be charged with terror financing, said Khawaja.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Ahmed has also been financing Afghan Taliban, we are still in the process of ascertaining if he has been providing financing through his businesses or someone else is behind him," the officer said.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Ahmed was also providing financial assistance to AQIS," Khawaja said, referring to Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda that was founded a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="9">The arrest is a rare success for Pakistan's police force, struggling with militancy and corruption as well as crime.</seg>
<seg id="10">After Taliban gunmen massacred around 150 people, mostly children, at an army-run school in December, the government vowed to crack down on militancy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Attacks have fallen sharply as the military has also pushed further into the lawless tribal regions bordering Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="12">But militant groups remain a threat, and many have followers in Pakistan's cities, which fall under the control of the chronically under-trained and under-funded police force.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ahmed, 52, used to give sermons at a mosque in Karachi's upscale Defense Housing Authority neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="14">His public sermons were moderate, but privately he encouraged radicalism, police said.</seg>
<seg id="15">He previously studied at the Pakistan Air Force College in Sargodha city, and left the Pakistani Air Force in 1998, another security official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.</seg>
<seg id="16">He later went into the paint and chemicals business.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rapper Rick Ross loses 'Everyday I'm hustlin" copyright claim</seg>
<seg id="2">NEW YORK Rapper Rick Ross cannot copyright the words "Everyday I'm hustlin'," a U.S. judge has ruled, putting an end to his claim against music group LMFAO for selling T-shirts with the similar catch-phrase "Everyday I'm shufflin'."</seg>
<seg id="3">In a ruling released on Tuesday in Miami federal court, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams said Ross's slogan, a prominent part of his 2006 debut hit "Hustlin'," is a short expression that courts have repeatedly said cannot be copyrighted.</seg>
<seg id="4">Williams' order puts a dent in a copyright infringement lawsuit that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, filed against LMFAO in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ross alleged the Los Angeles-based electropop duo, made up of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin'" for their own 2010 chart-topping "Party Rock Anthem," which contains the lyric "Everyday I'm shufflin'."</seg>
<seg id="6">The hip hop star said LMFAO's song was "an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame and success of Hustlin'."</seg>
<seg id="7">He also sued Kia Motors for using "Party Rock Anthem" in an advertising campaign.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the complaint, Ross claimed LMFAO violated his copyright by selling T-shirts and other merchandise bearing the shufflin' slogan.</seg>
<seg id="9">In her order on Tuesday, Williams said that "Hustlin'," as a song, is protected by copyright.</seg>
<seg id="10">But Ross' three-word slogan, is made up of ordinary words and cannot be copyrighted, she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The judge compared it to other music catch-phrases from the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh," "holla back," and "we get it poppin'," saying it is a "short expression of the sort that courts have uniformly held uncopyrightable."</seg>
<seg id="12">The judge did not rule on whether LMFAO's song itself was an unauthorized copy of "Hustlin'."</seg>
<seg id="13">A trial is scheduled for October.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lawyers for Ross and LMFAO could not immediately be reached for comment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, No.</seg>

<seg id="2">Political novice Ben Carson is gaining on bombastic frontrunner Donald Trump among Republican primary voters, according to the latest 2016 presidential race poll.</seg>
<seg id="3">Carson has gained 17 points since last month, while Jeb Bush has fallen by seven points.</seg>
<seg id="4">Following Trump's 27-percent support in the latest CBS/New York Times poll, Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, comes in at second with 23 percent, followed by Bush, television personality Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, each at six percent.</seg>
<seg id="5">Support among Republican primary voters rose from early August to early September for Trump, Carson, Ohio Governor John Kasich, and former Hewlett Packard executive Carly Fiorina.</seg>
<seg id="6">Support for the latter two remains in the single digits, though.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jeb Bush, the former Florida Governor and latest Bush family standard-bearer, dropped seven percentage points in a month, while Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker fell eight points.</seg>
<seg id="8">Walker has two-percent support in the latest poll.</seg>
<seg id="9">Carson pulled in more support from college graduates than Trump (29 percent to 21 percent), while Trump led Carson in voters without a college degree (30 percent to 19 percent).</seg>
<seg id="10">Men were more likely than women to support Trump, while women were more likely than men to go for Rubio.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thirty-seven percent of poll respondents said their mind was made up as to which candidate they will support in their respective state's primary vote.</seg>
<seg id="12">Those who said they knew who they will vote for were twice as likely to support Trump as opposed to Carson.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is too early to tell for 63 percent of Republican primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="14">Further results from the CBS/NYT poll, conducted from September 9 to 13, will be released later Tuesday ahead of a Republican presidential debate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Carson's rise in this poll mirrors the ascension of underdog Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders over longtime frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="16">The latest CBS presidential nomination tracker has Sanders up by 10 points and 22 points in Iowa and New Hampshire, respectively, among likely Democratic primary voters.</seg>

<seg id="2">A leading robot ethicist has launched a campaign calling for a ban on the development of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dr Kathleen Richardson, a robotics expert at De Montfort University in Leicester, England, warns that sex robots could contribute to the systemic dehumanization of women and children.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sex robots seem to be a growing focus in the robotics industry and the models that they draw on - how they will look, what roles they would play - are very disturbing indeed," she told the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="5">Richardson explained that her Campaign Against Sex Robots is not anti-sex, but rather anti-exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Technology is not neutral.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's informed by class, race and gender.</seg>

<seg id="9">That's why we can do something about it.</seg>
<seg id="10">These robots will contribute to more sexual exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Though the sex-bots currently being manufactured are still relatively primitive, Richardson is worried they are the first step to something more sinister.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a new and emerging technology, but let's nip in the bud.</seg>

<seg id="1">Britain to welcome first Syrian refugees - RT UK</seg>
<seg id="2">Britain will accept its first refugees fleeing the Syrian war in the next few days, Home Secretary Theresa May has announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">They will be cared for under the government's expanded resettlement program.</seg>
<seg id="4">Refugees seeking asylum will arrive from camps which border the war-torn country.</seg>
<seg id="5">They are the first of the 20,000 refugees the UK plans to take by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="6">Speaking in the House of Commons, the home secretary said the government is "working at speed" to secure more arrivals.</seg>
<seg id="7">In welcoming vulnerable refugees to the UK it is imperative that we have in place the support and help that they need and deserve.</seg>
<seg id="8">I know that honorable members and the general public are keen to know more detail on the numbers and when people are expected to arrive.</seg>
<seg id="9">May said the government needed to make further plans to ensure the refugees had adequate provisions when they arrive.</seg>
<seg id="10">I must underline that the scale of the expansion needs careful and meticulous planning to ensure we get it right.</seg>
<seg id="11">I and the Minister for Syrian refugees Richard Harrington will continue to update the House on that point.</seg>
<seg id="12">But I am pleased to tell the House that we are looking forward to welcoming the first wave of new arrivals in the coming days and are working at speed to plan for even more in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Prime Minister David Cameron drew the ire of MPs and campaigners when he unveiled the government's refugee plan, with many saying the figure was too low.</seg>
<seg id="14">Cameron told the House of Commons earlier in September that the UK would "live up to its moral responsibility" and take in 20,000 refugees from camps in the Middle East by the next general election.</seg>
<seg id="15">He added that refugees would not automatically be given full asylum, but instead a humanitarian status which would allow them to apply for asylum after five years.</seg>
<seg id="16">But critics noted that the figures amounted to only 12 refugees a day, with former Liberal Democrat MP Paddy Ashdown saying the measures were "derisory."</seg>
<seg id="17">Ashdown further revealed that children taken in by the scheme would be deported when they turned 18 if they are not granted asylum.</seg>
<seg id="18">Celebrities and high-profile public figures also came together to condemn the measures.</seg>
<seg id="19">In a signed letter, big names including Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the response to the crisis was "too little, too late."</seg>
<seg id="20">"A responsibility that should be shared with our European neighbors and not simply shouldered by the countries closest to the turbulence driving people from their homes," they wrote.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian ruble strengthened on Wednesday, trading at 65.66 to the US dollar and 73.98 to the euro on the Moscow Stock Exchange as of 10:00 GMT.</seg>
<seg id="3">Overall, the Russian currency has gained seven percent since its lowest rate of 71 rubles against the greenback on August 24.</seg>
<seg id="4">Analysts say the ruble's rebound is on the back of investor reaction to current global market turmoil caused by struggling China, the US Federal Reserve's possible interest rate hike and overreaction to cheap oil.</seg>
<seg id="5">Brent futures were up 61 cents Wednesday at $48.36 per barrel.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nasa and the UK work together on drone traffic system</seg>
<seg id="2">NASA is already working with the US government and companies like Google, Amazon and telecoms company Verizon on developing a database which will allow drone pilots to reserve blocks of airspace for flights.</seg>
<seg id="3">There is nothing yet in place at the EU level.</seg>
<seg id="4">The collaboration comes as a result of widespread anxiety about the possibility of a mid-air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="5">A new Forrester report vividly described the potential fallout.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of businesses delivering products or capturing data in dense urban areas like New York City, Chicago, or San Francisco," the research says.</seg>
<seg id="7">Without a common set of technology protocols and rules of the air, chaos could reign.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to Detta O'Cathain, a Baroness in the House of Lords, the concern has escalated in the wake of reports of near misses, and the operation of drones over football stadiums and close to nuclear power stations, and the Eiffel Tower.</seg>
<seg id="9">"More than 400 calls made to the Metropolitan police were regarding incidents involving drones over the last two years," O'Cathain said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The big idea: to build a system to track and trace all drones, especially those flying below 500 feet, irrespective of whether they were flown by commercial or leisure pilots.</seg>
<seg id="11">"As more small drones are flown commercially at low altitude beyond the sight of the pilot, or even flown completely autonomously, some sort of air traffic management infrastructure to separate flights will be required to ensure the safety of complex operations, for example, package delivery in cities," she said.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will incorporate services such as airspace design, severe weather and wind avoidance, congestion management, route planning and re-routing - similar to the rules in place for road traffic, such as signals and lanes.</seg>
<seg id="13">They expect to have a working prototype by 2019.</seg>
<seg id="14">The drone industry is set to explode in the European Union over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are already seeing small, innovative UK SME companies using this technology to great effect in the energy sector, agriculture and media industries," Lord Tariq said.</seg>
<seg id="16">More than 670 permissions for commercial drone operations in the UK alone were granted by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="17">The European Commission estimated that the drone industry could generate 150,000 jobs in the EU by 2050.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dislike button: Why Facebook wants to know what makes you sad</seg>
<seg id="2">"A Look Back" is similar; compiling your highlights and key moments (on Facebook).</seg>
<seg id="3">But what will it mean for those thronging multitudes within Facebook's virtual borders that now outnumber any country?</seg>
<seg id="4">An empathy button will, first, of course, allow Facebook to understand you better.</seg>
<seg id="5">Facebook's enormous value - around $240 billion at last count - is due to the unthinkably large mound of consumer data that it sits on.</seg>
<seg id="6">Every interaction, post, like and friend you make is put together to build a remarkably rich, and constantly updating picture of who you are, and what you're interested in.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is predominantly of value to advertisers, who can use all of this information to carefully sculpt who sees their adverts on Facebook to those they judge to be most interested in them.</seg>
<seg id="8">An empathy button adds another layer of data, and certainly opens the door to other kinds of advertisers to use that platform.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whilst a sports company goes after those who "like" a national football team, charities and campaigners will certainly wish to target those who "empathise" with the refugee crisis, for instance.</seg>
<seg id="10">It will also probably change what you see on your News Feed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Facebook uses incredibly clever and sophisticated algorithms to winnow down all the enormous universe of content that you could see, into the much smaller feed of what you do actually see.</seg>
<seg id="12">This algorithm crucially depends on what you've found interesting in the past, and especially what you've liked.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is, no doubt, a fear within Facebook that lots of meaningful but unhappy posts are missing the algorithmic cut because people don't feel comfortable liking them.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if Facebook understand more about what you find upsetting or unsettling, they could also take a decision to take these kinds of posts out of the News Feed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Facebook has previously conducted experiments to understand how what you see in your News Feed affects your emotional state, and especially how this transfers from person to person.</seg>
<seg id="16">Academics call this "emotional contagion" and although it sounds spooky, it was probably simply an attempt by Facebook (and openly published with their consent) to understand better how their platform works and whether they can tweak algorithms to share more stuff.</seg>
<seg id="17">Whatever happens to the empathy button, it will be Facebook's decision.</seg>
<seg id="18">The truly striking thing is how the decision of a single company to add a single button to their service can cause so much bubbling speculation.</seg>
<seg id="19">The reason it can is because the decisions that Facebook makes - whether involving the visible buttons we see, or the invisible algorithms working away underneath - now have profound consequences over us.</seg>
<seg id="20">We now live meaningful parts of our lives in the digital world, and go there to find everything from love to comfort, to a new job.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the other hand, Facebook is a company, and one that is fighting a constant struggle for survival within the fiercely Darwinian world of technology and social media.</seg>
<seg id="22">The decisions they make - new buttons included - will be those they judge to stay afloat in this race.</seg>
<seg id="23">I think many people can empathise with that; and soon they'll have a button to do so.</seg>

<seg id="2">Through ten years of research in America, Dr Goodwin and his team have established that body signals may be able to predict these sometimes violent changes before they happen, giving carers the opportunity to take appropriate action.</seg>
<seg id="3">The autistic children we're working with can't tell us what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="4">They can't say they have a headache, or 'it's too loud in here' or 'I don't like this teacher'," he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">If we want to understand them, we need to look at what their body is telling us - and we need to do this in a gentle, unobtrusive way.</seg>
<seg id="6">For instance, a simple visualisation of colours in an app could denote the level of agitation - red could be used as a warning of behavioural change, and blue could be used to denote under-arousal, allowing a carer to understand when the person is bored and lacking stimulation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Data from the wristbands could also be collected over time and saved on a secure server, allowing carers to understand the bigger picture of how the person responds to different situations, and to understand what interventions work best.</seg>
<seg id="8">I need to be clear that we are not reading minds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Bio sensors aren't magic - they still need a human to interpret them.</seg>
<seg id="10">He added that his team would be working with manufacturers to further develop this technology so that it can be autism-specific.</seg>
<seg id="11">The research has been welcomed by Jane Carolan, director of client services at Wirral Autistic Society, which will be showcasing the technology at its Autech 2015 conference on autism and technology in Manchester on 1 October.</seg>
<seg id="12">When you work with people with severe autism, as we do, you see the dramatic difference that assistive technology can make to their quality of life. iPad apps are now, literally, giving a voice to people who have never spoken.</seg>
<seg id="13">Robots are helping autistic children learn to play peek-a-boo.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Who knows where this innovation may lead us," she said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Assistive technologies can be truly life-changing and we feel it is part of our mission as an autism charity to ensure everyone has access this information and is part of the debate about how we want to support people with autism in the future.</seg>

<seg id="8">AdBlock Plus, a popular ad-blocking tool on desktops, has also released its own iOS web browser that limits ads; its maker has plans to release a Safari extension in the future.</seg>
<seg id="9">People using ad-blocking software are likely to run into a few hitches.</seg>
<seg id="10">Advertising still shows up within apps (which is where Apple makes its money on iOS).</seg>
<seg id="11">A growing number of media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are also attempting to stop people visiting their site from using ad blockers.</seg>
<seg id="12">Still, the use of ad blockers on desktop computers rose about 48% last year.</seg>

<seg id="6">Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, particularly as the Spanish territory of Catalonia is set to vote in elections later this month.</seg>
<seg id="7">"As a matter of foreign policy, we are deeply committed to maintaining a relationship with a strong and unified Spain," Obama said.</seg>
<seg id="8">The commander-in-chief also told King Felipe that he would like to visit the country sometime before he leaves office in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1">Arctic mosquito swarms are big enough to take down a caribou</seg>
<seg id="2">Many studies have highlighted species made more vulnerable by a warming climate, but global warming has proven a boon to some.</seg>
<seg id="3">One of those species is the arctic mosquito.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to researchers at the Dartmouth College, warmer temperatures in the arctic have enabled mosquitoes there to emerge earlier in the year and grow to larger sizes, thus boosting population sizes.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a new study, arctic researchers at Dartmouth's John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding used their field observations to model the effects of temperature changes on arctic mosquitoes.</seg>
<seg id="6">Their analysis predicts a 50 percent increase in the survival rate of adult mosquitoes with just a 2 degrees Celsius temperature rise.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mosquitoes may be small, but they're a significant member of the arctic food chain and ecosystem.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new analysis -- detailed in a new paper published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B -- aims to help biologists better predict how a growing mosquito population might affect the caribou they feed on, the birds and insects that feed on them and the plants they pollinate.</seg>
<seg id="9">To build their model, Dartmouth scientists combined their field results with results of their lab experiments, which looked at how temperature affects the insect's growth and susceptibility to predation.</seg>
<seg id="10">While a rise in temperature makes developing mosquitoes more vulnerable to diving beetles, it also gives them a head start in the spring and makes their larval development faster and more efficient -- a net positive.</seg>
<seg id="11">More mosquitoes likely means a growing population -- but only as big as the insects' food sources can sustain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ability for mosquitoes to turn their improved survivability rate into an improved reproductive rate depends on their ability to secure a blood meal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Antidepressant use during pregnancy does not affect child</seg>
<seg id="2">Three new studies show the use of antidepressants by pregnant women does not have neurodevelopmental or behavioral effects on their children.</seg>
<seg id="3">The studies showed that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, carry an increased risk for postpartum bleeding, however researchers said depression poses a greater risk for women and their children, which requires it to be addressed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"These studies add to a growing body of evidence about the safety of taking antidepressants during pregnancy," John Thorp, deputy editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, which published all three of the studies, said in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">While there are some increased risks, the evidence so far seems to be that the risks of untreated depression outweigh the risks of taking them.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Norwegian Institute of Public Health conducted a study on motor development of children whose mothers were treated with SSRIs by analyzing data on 51,404 children from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, looking at the effects of SSRI use on motor skill development at age 3.</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers found 381 mothers had used SSRIs while pregnant, and 159 of them were treated with the drugs for a prolonged period.</seg>
<seg id="8">While exposure to SSRIs was weakly associated with a delay in motor development, researchers wrote in the study that the association was "not to the extent that the delay was of clinical importance."</seg>
<seg id="9">A group of researchers at the University of Adelaide in Australia conducted a review of data on 49,000 women in the Danish National Birth Cohort to find the effects of SSRI use on children's behavior by age 7.</seg>
<seg id="10">The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with increased risk for problem behavior.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the 210 children whose mothers were treated for depression with SSRIs there was no increased risk for behavioral problems, as compared with 231 children who were more likely to have behavior issues such as hyperactivity, inattention, and peer problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more likely to experience bleeding after giving birth if they were treated with SSRIs.</seg>
<seg id="13">The review of medical data for 30,198 women who gave birth at a teaching hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed the risk for postpartum hemorrhaging increased by 5 percent, from 11 to 16 percent, if women were treated with SSRIs.</seg>
<seg id="14">The risk of a severe hemorrhage or postpartum anemia also doubled, the researchers reported.</seg>
<seg id="15">The researchers said that while the study linked SSRI use to the increased risk, there is a large number of variables -- from drugs used during delivery to the limited amount of information researchers had about specific medical conditions of the women -- which all could have an effect on the potential for bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is possible that the women who took antidepressants late in pregnancy were those with the most severe illness and it is this which is responsible for the increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage and not the antidepressant," said Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, a professor at the University of Adelaide.</seg>
<seg id="17">Based on this study alone we do not recommend that women stop taking medication for depression during pregnancy, but are closely monitored in order to reduce the risk of any potential increased risk of bleeding as much as possible.</seg>

<seg id="1">Matthew indicted on murder charge in killing of Va. Tech student</seg>
<seg id="2">The man accused of killing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham has been indicted on a charge of first-degree murder in the slaying of a Virginia Tech student who went missing in 2009, authorities announced Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">A grand jury in Albemarle County, Va., on Friday indicted Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 33, of Charlottesville, in the killing of Morgan Harrington, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Matthew also has been charged with abduction with intent to defile.</seg>
<seg id="5">Each charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.</seg>
<seg id="6">Harrington, 20, disappeared outside a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her remains were discovered three months later.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her parents said the news of the indictment was a relief.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's something we've been working for determinedly and diligently for six years," said Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am very pleased to know that when you take a life, there should be consequences to that act.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dominoes of consequences have been set into motion for Jesse Matthew.</seg>
<seg id="11">Police have said a forensic link connected the cases of Harrington, Graham and a 2005 sexual assault in Fairfax County.</seg>
<seg id="12">In June, Matthew was convicted of the last crime and is awaiting sentencing in that case.</seg>
<seg id="13">He remains in jail in Charlottesville.</seg>
<seg id="14">Jesse Matthew to face capital murder charges in U-Va. student's death</seg>
<seg id="15">Harrington had traveled to U-Va. on Oct. 17, 2009, to attend a Metallica concert with friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">The group became separated when Harrington left Charlottesville's John Paul Jones Arena to use the bathroom and could not get back inside.</seg>
<seg id="17">She was last seen trying to catch a ride around 8:30 p.m. outside the arena.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the time, Harrington was wearing a black T-shirt for the band Pantera.</seg>
<seg id="19">After her disappearance, Harrington's purse and cellphone were discovered in the parking lot of the arena.</seg>
<seg id="20">Family and friends began a massive search for Harrington, an education major who wanted to be a teacher, and Metallica publicized her disappearance on its Web site.</seg>
<seg id="21">In November 2009, the T-shirt she was wearing was found near a row of apartments in Charlottesville.</seg>
<seg id="22">Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in a remote hayfield on a farm southwest of Charlottesville.</seg>
<seg id="23">Around the time of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew had worked as a cab driver in Charlottesville, although it's unclear whether that period overlapped with the date when Harrington disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="24">Police said a significant break in Harrington's case came with Matthew's arrest in Graham's disappearance last year.</seg>
<seg id="25">Officials familiar with the investigation said the cases are linked by DNA evidence.</seg>
<seg id="26">Investigators have not detailed publicly any new evidence that might have led them to charge Matthew in Harrington's slaying now.</seg>
<seg id="27">Capital defender Douglas Ramseur, who is representing Matthew in the Graham case, declined to comment.</seg>
<seg id="28">The announcement of the charges comes two days after the one-year anniversary of Hannah Graham's disappearance on Sept.</seg>
<seg id="29">That case has similarities with Harrington's: Both were young college students who disappeared after nights out in Charlottesville.</seg>
<seg id="30">Graham, an 18-year-old from Fairfax County, was last seen walking with Matthew on a downtown mall near the U-Va. campus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Matthew was arrested in that case weeks later after a nationwide manhunt.</seg>
<seg id="32">Graham's body was discovered in October.</seg>
<seg id="33">Matthew is scheduled to stand trial in Graham's capital murder case in July.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the early days of Graham's disappearance last fall in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington became a presence at rallies and vigil for the missing U-Va. student.</seg>
<seg id="35">Harrington said that she has endured speculation and criticism in the media about her daughter that she says must be silenced by the new charges against Matthew.</seg>
<seg id="36">"It validates that along this path there's been some "Why was she wearing a mini-skirt?" and "Was she asking for it?" kind of talk, and that kind of questioning and characterization doesn't hold up when it's clear there was a predator on the prowl," Harrington said.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the Fairfax County case, Matthew was convicted of sexually assaulting a young woman in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="38">The woman, who was 26 at the time of the attack, told jurors that a stranger came up behind her as she was walking home from a grocery store on a September evening.</seg>
<seg id="39">She said he carried her to a grassy area, beat and choked her, and then sexually assaulted her.</seg>
<seg id="40">"I was thinking, "This is going to be the end, keep screaming, keep screaming," " the woman testified.</seg>
<seg id="41">I feared this is going to be the end of my life.</seg>
<seg id="42">Matthew suddenly ran off, the woman said.</seg>
<seg id="43">A prosecutor told jurors that Matthew may have been startled by the lights of a car pulling into a nearby parking lot.</seg>
<seg id="44">He was charged years later after DNA linked him to the case.</seg>
<seg id="45">Matthew is scheduled to be sentenced in October.</seg>
<seg id="46">Matthew is scheduled to make his first court appearance in the Harrington case in Charlottesville on Wednesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="47">Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said he will likely be in Charlottesville on Wednesday and will visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.</seg>
<seg id="48">"We have at least taken another step today," Dan Harrington said.</seg>

<seg id="10">Like the other mayors from the border with Hungary, he said that the police demanded information on accommodation available in case of a wave of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="11">We were asked how many people we can accommodate.</seg>
<seg id="12">In our town there is no space for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="13">We believe that such special centres should not exist at the border, because they are more difficult to control, as the migrants are tempted to flee, because they are not interested to remain in Romania.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best thing would be to be set up such centres in areas far from the border" stated the Mayor of Iratosu commune, Papp Atila Iosif.</seg>
<seg id="15">In turn, the mayor of Dorobanti commune, Vincentiu Almasi, said that he was asked about accommodation places for both the refugees and the intervention forces if they were to be deployed in the area.</seg>
<seg id="16">The police asked if we can accommodate gendarmes too.</seg>
<seg id="17">We can find places in the Cultural Centres, but we cannot accommodate refugees.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have also been asked about the length of the border with Hungary. They are probably working on an action plan," said Vincentiu Almasi.</seg>
<seg id="19">He added that at the local police station, "starting Tuesday, when Hungary has sealed its border with Serbia, a permanent activity was established".</seg>
<seg id="20">"There is always a police officer in the station, and people know they have to report if they see any foreigner in the area," stated the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="21">Pilu City Hall representatives said they can accommodate no more than a hundred people in the Cultural Centre, and the information was provided to the police, at their request.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, the Mayor of Curtici city, Nicolae Aanitei, said there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of the local Public Finance Directorate, but improvements are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, a former barrack of the Border Police could be equipped to accommodate refugees.</seg>
<seg id="24">The representatives of the Press Office of Arad County Police Department did not comment on the questioning of Mayors during this time, confirming only that "in the border towns of Arad county the patrolling activities were intensified."</seg>

<seg id="2">Asia-Pacific millionaires will form this year the group with the richest people in the world, thanks to their fortunes accumulated in China and India, according to a study released on Wednesday by RBC Wealth Management and Capgemini.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this document, in 2015 the cumulative fortunes of Asia Pacific millionaires will exceed the total of 15.800 billion dollars recorded in 2014 and the fortunes of the North America's millionaires, which currently represent the richest people in the world, with a cumulative fortune of 16,200 billion dollars, according to AFP.</seg>
<seg id="4">The study states that the Asia Pacific region already has the highest number of very rich people, known in financial jargon as High Net Worth Individuals, HNWI, with 4.69 million of such individuals in 2014 compared to 4.68 million in North America .</seg>
<seg id="5">HNWIs are people who can invest at least a million dollars, without taking into account the value of real estate and other possessions.</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the future, HNWIs fortune is expected to grow further in the Asia Pacific region than in any other region of the world, most of the new fortunes coming from the emerging economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand," mentions the study conducted by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="7">The report estimates that China and India account for nearly 10% of the global HNWI wealth and are responsible for 17% of global growth of new fortunes after 2006.</seg>
<seg id="8">China, the world's second largest economy after the US, had in 2014 a total of 890,000 millionaires with an accumulated fortune of 4.500 billion dollars and an increase of 17.5% and 19.3% compared to 2013.</seg>

<seg id="2">In Suceava, workers installed a traffic light upside down, so instead of being notified that they have to wait 4 seconds, passers-by receive the 'h' message that they do not know how to decipher.</seg>

<seg id="3">Although Hungary has closed the border with barbed wire fence and introduced tough measures against illegal immigrants, including arrest, refugees continue to gather at the Serbian-Hungarian border, according to The Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="4">Water cannons were put into operation when the immigrants managed to enter through the barbed wire fence at the Röszke border crossing point.</seg>
<seg id="5">Hungarian police said that the use of water cannons was a measure to control the crowd, who was throwing water bottles.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are no reports of any injuries, but some people were crying after the use of teargas.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Greek publication Enikos writes at the same time that two German companies refuse to deliver barbed wire to Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="8">The country has already raised the fence on the border with Serbia and on Tuesday announced its intention to raise one at the border with Romania, an initiative strongly criticized by Bucharest.</seg>
<seg id="9">German companies argue that barbed wire is very dangerous and can cause cuts that can become infected.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is used to secure prisons or military facilities, but should not be used against people seeking shelter, said the companies' representatives.</seg>
<seg id="11">In parallel with the Hungarian border confrontations, Croatia has mobilized to provide buses to the immigrants to transport those who come at the country's border with Serbia.</seg>

<seg id="2">The purpose of the former Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from even more austerity and fundamentally change its relationship with the EU leadership in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="3">Eventually, the leader of Syriza party made Greece enter into a third loan agreement, which results in more years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews which publishes an interview with him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now, however, Tsipras asks the Greeks again to entrust him with the prime minister position, during an election which he says will strengthen his political position.</seg>
<seg id="5">Our goal was to get an agreement, not to exit from the Eurozone or the dismantling of the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Now for the first time, the possibility for the restructuring of Greece's debt remains open," said the former Greek Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now we have an agreement that can be described as strict.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Although I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have ended in an agreement," said Tsipras.</seg>
<seg id="9">He believes that the financing part of the agreement represents a great success for the Greek Government, showing that the country's financial needs are covered until 2019.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Alexis Tsipras also states that Greece "definitely needs reforms", adding that the reform should begin with the state.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tsipras announced his resignation on August 27, thus paving the way for early elections in September, after seven stormy months at the lead of the Athens Executive, during which he approved a third saving loan for Greece.</seg>

<seg id="1">They are being targeted by machineguns of the West.</seg>
<seg id="2">Stop supporting terrorism!</seg>
<seg id="3">Syrian President Bashar al Assad gave a rare interview to the Russian media, in which he speaks about the refugees and accuses the West of supporting terrorists and that the immigrants are being "targeted".</seg>
<seg id="4">"The West weeps for them and yet the West has supported terrorists even from the beginning of the crisis, when it was said that this is a peaceful uprising," said Assad, in an interview with Russia Today.</seg>
<seg id="5">The leader in Damascus states his Western counterparts say that the situation in Syria is the same as the Islamic State terrorism, "but it's happening because of the Syrian government, the Syrian regime or the Syrian president".</seg>
<seg id="6">As long as this propaganda continues, there will be more refugees.</seg>
<seg id="7">So it is not that Europe has not accepted or embraced them as refugees, is about not treating the cause.</seg>
<seg id="8">If you are worried about them, you are no longer supporting terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="9">That's what we think about the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">"That is the core of all the issues regarding refugees", said the Syrian leader.</seg>
<seg id="11">Assad continued to accuse Western countries and the way they treat refugees.</seg>
<seg id="12">The West is now weeping for the refugees with one eye and targets them with a machine gun with the other eye, because those refugees have actually left Syria due to terrorism, in principle because of terrorist crimes and secondarily because the results of terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="13">"When you have terrorism and the destruction of the infrastructure, you will no longer have basic living resources, and as a result many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to earn a living somewhere in this world", says Bashar al Assad.</seg>
<seg id="14">"If you ask any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and safety for every person and every family'", said the Syrian President, adding that political forces, whether they are part of the Government or not, "should unite around what is wanted by the Syrian people".</seg>
<seg id="15">The Syrian President believes that the dialogue in his country should continue "to reach a consensus", which cannot be implemented "unless Syria overpowers terrorism".</seg>
<seg id="16">"I would like to take this opportunity to ask all forces to unite against terrorism, because this is how the political objectives can be achieved, objectives that we as Syrians, want to achieve through dialogue and political action", said Bashar al Assad.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also spoke about one of his country's allies, Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that, in the context of the Ukraine crisis, he was transformed from a friend of the West to its foe.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bashar al Assad compares the situation in Syria to that in Russia, once again accusing the West of falsifying reality in both cases.</seg>
<seg id="19">Watch what happened in the Western media after the blow in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="20">What happened?</seg>
<seg id="21">President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an foe and was characterized as a tsar.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses the opposition in Russia and who came to power by undemocratic means, despite the fact that he was elected in democratic elections, and the West itself has acknowledged that the elections were democratic.</seg>
<seg id="23">Now, they are no longer democratic.</seg>
<seg id="24">"This is Western propaganda", said the leader in Damascus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Last but not least, he included Russia on the list of friendly countries - and regional partners - with which Syria is ready to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, along with Iran and Iraq, "as they faces the same kind of terrorism".</seg>
<seg id="26">Instead, Bashar Assad criticized Turkey, another neighbouring country, President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, saying that " they cannot make even a move without coordinating first with the United States and other Western countries. "</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, Syria's President accuses the "international coalition" led by the United States, which fights against terrorism: "In fact, since this coalition began to operate, the Islamic State has begun to expand."</seg>
<seg id="28">In other words, the coalition has failed and has no impact in the field.</seg>
<seg id="29">Meanwhile, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide coverage for terrorism, as France, the US and others cannot fight terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="30">You cannot be against terrorism and fight terrorism at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is a scorpion - if you put in your pocket, it will sting you - then we have no objection in cooperating with all these countries, since it is a real coalition not a fake one, which fights against terrorism, ", said the leader in Damascus.</seg>

<seg id="2">The collapse of oil prices caused great losses last year to the workers in oil production, shareholders of energy companies and countries heavily dependent on this resource.</seg>
<seg id="3">But there is also a positive effect: gasoline's price has decreased enormously.</seg>
<seg id="4">A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that during October 2014 - July 2015 in nearly all the 76 countries considered, fuel prices have decreased.</seg>
<seg id="5">The most significant price reduction at the pump is observed in Venezuela.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this country, diesel oil got cheaper by 97%, so you can fuel 24 SUVs with less than one dollar.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the opposite side is Saudi Arabia, where the price is kept steady by the state.</seg>
<seg id="8">The cost of diesel oil varies from country to country, depending on the refining conditions, changes in terms of taxation, and exchange rate fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="9">For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg has turned the average price of each state into US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="10">The situation in Romania</seg>
<seg id="11">Bloomberg data show that, in the second quarter, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (approx. 3.8 litres) was $ 5.49.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus, we ranked 27th among the countries with the most expensive fuel.</seg>
<seg id="13">But we should not worry about this position.</seg>
<seg id="14">Compared to the last quarter of 2014, gasoline got cheaper in Romania as well.</seg>
<seg id="15">Then, the average price of a gallon was $ 6.14, which means a price reduction of 10.6%.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, neighbouring countries rank better.</seg>

<seg id="2">German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised Tuesday night that the federal government will further support the 16 States of the federation in receiving and distributing tens of thousands of migrants who enter the country via southern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a meeting of nearly 4 hours with the prime ministers of the 16 federal states, Merkel said "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to deal with the large numbers of refugees", notes DPA agency.</seg>
<seg id="4">She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial arrivals and distribution centres.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Such pivotal points are needed" she said.</seg>
<seg id="6">The whole country should provide a massive boost to deal with the crisis, Merkel added.</seg>
<seg id="7">The States' prime ministers demanded more help than the 6 billion euros agreed by the government coalition at a federal level over a week ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thuringian Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow from the Left Party demanded "at least a double amount, and regarding the arrangements, they should be accelerated", during some comments for a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="9">In turn, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Malu Dreyer insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We need a national pact between all the players, not just the federal government, states and municipalities, but also business, trade unions and civil society," she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dreyer also asked that the bureaucracy in handling refugees and migrants be accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="12">She noted that Switzerland has completed the processing within 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany took more than 5 months.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer expressed similar ideas.</seg>
<seg id="14">Until now, Bavaria carries the heaviest burden, with the largest number of migrants who have arrived after crossing the border with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="15">Seehofer, a strong actor on the federal scene as head of the Christian Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal government coalition, has clashed publicly with Merkel after the Chancellor announced an open door virtual policy at the beginning of the month, states DPA.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lucescu was extremely angry at the end of the match with Real Madrid, lost by Sahtior Donetk 0-4.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Romanian coach was completely upset with the arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost because it was deprived.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the match I said one thing, that I want to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="5">Unfortunately, in matches against majour European teams we are always disadvantaged by the referees.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are two totally different attitudes.</seg>
<seg id="7">We are given a yellow card immediately, while the top teams are not.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, the first penalty was given for no reason!</seg>
<seg id="9">The ball hit Darijo on the back without touching his hand.</seg>
<seg id="10">A game of such level should not have been influenced by the referee.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I regret the fact that arbitration has ruined the game," Mircea Lucescu said at the press conference.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Madam, what is that awful smell"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was the pieces of her dismembered husband</seg>
<seg id="3">A murder of an extraordinary sadism terrified the residents of Târgu Frumos and Roman.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday morning, in the early hours, the merchants of Târgu Frumos were the witnesses of terrifying scenes in the square outside the main entrance.</seg>
<seg id="5">Besides the three bins, forensics had "assembled" the pieces of what appeared to be a man's body.</seg>
<seg id="6">His body was cut into pieces but his head, internal organs and genitals were missing.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the end, it turned out to be the body of a former officer who was murdered by his wife, a geography teacher.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Ziarul de Iasi" chatted leisurely with the taxi driver who unknowingly helped the criminal to carry the bags containing the body.</seg>
<seg id="9">His story make you hair stand on end.</seg>
<seg id="10">A taxi driver in Târgu Frumos alerted the police yesterday about the fact that a woman was carrying three bags that emitted a terrible smell, after pieces of the body had been found in the market dumpster.</seg>
<seg id="11">Similar to an American movie, the man himself unknowingly helped to carry the bags filled with human remains which emitted a terrible stench. The criminal was his customer.</seg>
<seg id="12">The taxi driver exclusively recounted the story for "Ziarul de Iași". He told us the shocking situation he went through, unwittingly helping a murderer hide the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="13">He himself carried the bags containing the sliced body pieces of the geography teacher's husband.</seg>
<seg id="14">She came in Târgu Frumos to hide evidence of the crime, as far away from her home in Roman.</seg>
<seg id="15">Maybe it's lamb.</seg>
<seg id="16">I had no way of knowing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Uncle Mihai, as he is known by his pals who work as taxi drivers in Târgu Frumos, rocketed to stardom overnight in the small town he lives in.</seg>
<seg id="18">He'd seen American movies throughout his life, but never believed he would ever be the witness of the discovery of such a sadistic murder, and see the body pieces with his own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="19">He recounts that on the night of Monday to Tuesday, he was waiting as usual for the arrival of the regular coaches which transited the town.</seg>
<seg id="20">He was near the junction of the roads which lead to Roman and Pașcani.</seg>
<seg id="21">The cabbie says he saw the killer in his rear-view mirror, sitting next to the bags which contained human remains, leaned against the road sign indicating the nearby localities.</seg>
<seg id="22">She arrived with the Massaro bus, at 1.30 at night.</seg>
<seg id="23">The coach left her ten meters from the crosswalk of the road leading to Pașcani, exactly in front of the milestone.</seg>
<seg id="24">The bags were leaning against the road sign.</seg>
<seg id="25">After the coach left, I backed up the car ten meters and stopped next to her.</seg>
<seg id="26">I opened the trunk and after I loaded a bag, I asked:</seg>
<seg id="27">I saw she was an older woman, and I wanted to help her.</seg>
<seg id="28">I thought she was taking some meat to the market to sale it. It thought it was lamb. I had no way of knowing.</seg>
<seg id="29">I thought she was trying to trick somebody into buying that smelly meat.</seg>
<seg id="30">She was trying to lift bag by herself, and I rushed to help her.</seg>
<seg id="31">I put my hand on top of the bag, near the portion were it was tied.</seg>
<seg id="32">"She told me to drop her off at the gate of the market, when I picked her up at the bus stop" said Uncle Mihai.</seg>
<seg id="33">The smell was so bad I could hardly sit in the car.</seg>
<seg id="34">He added that the woman said absolutely nothing, and as a result, he didn't ask her anything.</seg>
<seg id="35">I said nothing until we reached our destination because I was angry that she put a carcass in my car.</seg>
<seg id="36">When she unloaded the bags out of the car, I noticed that the smell was even worse.</seg>
<seg id="37">She took the bags out of the trunk.</seg>
<seg id="38">When I got back into the car, I backed up a couple of meters to turn the car around, and I realised I couldn't breathe because of the smell.</seg>
<seg id="39">I left the car trunk open and I drove around so the smell would go away.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the bus stop I didn't notice if she was helped by someone with the bags, because lights were coming from behind and I couldn't see in the mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="41">"There were two plastic bags and a raffia one", added the man.</seg>
<seg id="42">Seeing the woman's strange behaviour, he says he started to get curious.</seg>
<seg id="43">In my mind, I realised that something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="44">After she took her bags out of the car, I left for the hospital, towards the town hall, and when I returned, I specifically looked to see what the woman was doing with her luggage.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the meantime she had pulled the luggage behind the fence, near the bins inside the market.</seg>
<seg id="46">Then I left again.</seg>
<seg id="47">A minibus and a bus arrived from Italy causing some agitation.</seg>
<seg id="48">I saw the woman going to the drivers and trying to board the buses, to disappear, but perhaps that the drivers didn't want to take her because they only do international routes, and do not accept occasional passengers.</seg>
<seg id="49">The woman was very agitated, pacing back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="50">At one point, the woman entered a Peco gas station and, out of curiosity, I asked an employee what she had done inside.</seg>
<seg id="51">The employee replied that she washed her hands.</seg>
<seg id="52">Then I asked him if he knew were the police patrol was, because I had seen it some time ago.</seg>
<seg id="53">I've searched and found the police coming towards the market.</seg>
<seg id="54">I showed them the woman and told them that something was suspicious about her.</seg>
<seg id="55">"Then I left, I had a ride to Belcești" added Uncle Mihai.</seg>
<seg id="56">He told us that the woman became agitated after leaving the bags in the bins.</seg>
<seg id="57">In my opinion, it was suspicions that the bags were gone, and I was curious what she did with them.</seg>
<seg id="58">When police approached her and asked her what she was doing there, pointing towards me and saying that I warned them she had a suspicious bag.</seg>
<seg id="59">Then the woman went to the garbage cans and showed them the bags.</seg>
<seg id="60">"I returned to where she hid the bags around 3 a.m. when I gave statements to police and prosecutors at the scene", concluded the cabbie.</seg>
<seg id="61">Neamt prosecutors, who are investigating the case, say that the teacher aged 64, Ana Zaharia was caught by the cameras of a gas stations in Roman at 0.55, boarding a bus with the three bags.</seg>
<seg id="62">She arrived in Târgu Frumosat 1:30.</seg>
<seg id="63">According to the investigators, she killed her husband, with whom she was married for four years, with a knife, then cut his body into pieces inside the house.</seg>
<seg id="64">The man's name was Gheorghe Zaharia, and was a reserve officer.</seg>
<seg id="65">On Sunday evening, the woman placed the body parts in two plastic bags, transporting the bags to the bus station, and hiding them.</seg>
<seg id="66">The other night, she transported one more bag, then decided which direction to take. She chose the Bucharest - Iași coach.</seg>
<seg id="67">Last night, prosecutors still did not know where the woman hid her husband's internal organs or genitals.</seg>
<seg id="68">The head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags in a closet in the woman's apartment.</seg>
<seg id="69">She was retired, like her husband.</seg>
<seg id="70">Until yesterday, prosecutors hadn't learned the motif for killing her husband in cold blood.</seg>
<seg id="71">Most likely, the teacher will undergo a psychiatric expertise, and the body will be examined by the forensic experts to formally determine the cause of death and any other relevant details.</seg>

<seg id="1">The City Hall took over the national roads in the municipality, after they had been taken over by the Government years ago to be asphalted with money from the national budget during the 2004 electoral campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2">The decision was enacted yesterday by the Local Council (LC), and in order for it to be implemented a Government Resolution is needed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some sources say that the transfer of the management right from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a condition for that institution to grant approval for the General Urban Plan (GUP).</seg>
<seg id="4">City Hall took over a network of 11 km of roads.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a legislative amendment which was enacted in July 2015 compelled the municipality to take over the national roads crossing the city.</seg>
<seg id="6">An approval from the National Roads cannot be issued unless it complies with the law, so it was necessary to approve this point.</seg>
<seg id="7">The National roads fall upon our administration as of today.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Of course, a government resolution has to be issued as a consequence of the City Council's decision" said Acting Mayor Mihai Chirica.</seg>
<seg id="9">The National roads crossing the city are DN 24 and DN 28.</seg>
<seg id="10">National Road 28 crosses Iasi on the arteries: Păcurari road, Munteni street (at the traffic light, Moara de Foc, Străpungerea Silvestru, Silvestru street, bd. Nicolae Iorga, bd. Primăverii, Calea Chișinăului, Țuțora road until the exit from the city towards Tomești - Albița.</seg>
<seg id="11">The other national road, DN 24, includes Bucium road, bd. Socola (until the traffic lights) Bucium Street (until Base 3), Calea Chisinaului, bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, bd. C.A. Rosetti and exit onto Cârlig-Sculeni.</seg>

<seg id="1">Radu Gyr and Eliade</seg>
<seg id="2">Continuing the description of some sheets in the youthful political sympathies "file" of Mircea Eliade which, as briefly as they are presented, exceed the size of a newspaper article and must be disseminated as a series, I think the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade deserves to be evoked, one of the most vehement counts used by the detractors of the great Romanian scholar.</seg>
<seg id="3">A less humorous description would hopefully be helpful in the real debate that the recent law, called "anti-legionary", ought to provoke in the Romanian intellectual environment.</seg>
<seg id="4">By critically analysing various verses which spoke of Eliade's enrolment in the Legion through the "Axa" Nest and Radu Gyr, Florin Țurcanu discusses these issues in the volume called Mircea Eliade.</seg>
<seg id="5">Prizonierul istoriei (The prisoner of history) (Bucharest, 2003), is another hypothesis we are very interested in because we want to understand the resumption of the epistolary contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after Ceausescu had played the "balcony scene" in August of that year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Relying on documents signed by Radu Gyr after he was pressured during the Security Police investigation in 1941, the documents kept in the Romanian Intelligence Service archives today (FD, file 573, F.15) and a prosecution note from 1938, Florin Țurcanu says that "Eliade will not join their group, but the so-called "legionary family" called Luminita (The light), a group of intellectuals, especially writers, led by poet Radu Gyr".</seg>
<seg id="7">Because there are no verifiable data regarding the Luminita nest, those that were exiled considered that the existence of this "legionary family" was questionable. What needs to be discussed is the context in which this information was recorded on file.</seg>
<seg id="8">Leaving aside the surprising kindness of the Romanian Intelligence Service to provide Mr. Țurcanu with secret files, the most obvious thing is that, at the time, the target of the Security Police was "commander" Radu Gyr. Eliade was mentioned in the note of 21 March 1938, in the context in which Armand Calinescu, the Minister of the Interior was given free hand to take all necessary measures so that king Carol could be able to impose royal dictatorship, suspending parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of the Legionaries which started to receive an unexpected popularity (the "Totul pentru țară" (anything for the country) party ranked number 3 in the elections of 1937).</seg>
<seg id="9">Eliade's arrest was made as a result of this note, cited by Țurcanu : "Mircea Eliade, writer and journalist, registered in the legionary movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".</seg>
<seg id="10">As for me, I see this note as a thin bureaucratic cover for the repression of 1938 and is likely that such superficial notes have been made hastily for the great majority of the Legionaries or active public supporters who had to be arrested, but also had to be tied to an important legionnaire leader.</seg>
<seg id="11">Once Radu Gyr was in custody in February 1941, after the suppression of the legionary rebellion, he wrote the statement mentioned above, which merely confirms the first retrospective method of banal bureaucratic cover in any policing, authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="12">It would have been interesting if Țurcanu would have provided more details about the content of quoted file no. 573.</seg>
<seg id="13">Was the file made for Eliade or Radu Gyr?</seg>
<seg id="14">The file in question must have been created based on the documents issued by the Security Police, but processed by the State Security Directorate to be used against one or the other.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are talking about an equivocation, just as when using the term "member" of the Movement, known only by someone who knows the composition of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation which is a preceding, trial stage in which the one at issue behaves as an active sympathizer in the probation period of three years before becoming a fledged "comrade".</seg>
<seg id="16">Also, all these secondary forms of organization like intellectual clubs or circles, social gatherings, discussion groups with the peasants, youth and student organizations revolved around a nest. The people in these groups were families, not the nest itself as a cohesive form of political organization and action.</seg>
<seg id="17">Such nuances completely evade the uninformed reader making Eliade's "member" status (which may be plausible) understood and used literally to designate political enrolling in the nest.</seg>
<seg id="18">The invocation of such subtle interpretation certainly cannot conceal the public support of the Guard and the clear sympathy for the Captain which spirited Eliade during 1935-1940, regardless of the wake of Nae Ionescu.</seg>
<seg id="19">Public support of a cause you believe in does not necessarily mean the actual political enrolment especially since, as a rule, this kind of intellectuals have a kind of superiority in comparison to the actual activists and join the politics only when they are directly offered the highest privileges.</seg>
<seg id="20">As much as I was able to form an opinion about the type of Eliade's thinking at that time, when he was the "leader of the young generation," I find it hard to believe that he could have accepted the hierarchical rigors of a legionary nest.</seg>
<seg id="21">And Radu Gyr's intellectual ascendancy was not comparable to that of Nae Ionescu, though!</seg>
<seg id="22">Not to mention that every legionnaire "file's" main element is the anti-Semitic and violent public activity, both worthy of being stigmatized, non-existent in case of Eliade, at least until proven otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="23">As for the correspondence between Eliade and Gyr between 1968 - 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic defender of Eliade, tries to penalize the statements of Florin Țurcanu (based however on some archive documents, even if they should have been seriously dissected and contextualized) with a questionable argument.</seg>
<seg id="24">In his volume "Noi glose asupra lui Mircea Eliade" (Bucharest, 2006), Mircea Handoca finds that "no line in the correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr contains any allusion that would support that classification."</seg>
<seg id="25">When Radu Gyr somehow managed to be released alive from the communist mines in 1968, he couldn't risk making any allusions in his letters, as they were obviously intercepted by the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="26">I think that Mircea Handoca was trying to emphasize that the tone of the letters sent by Radu Gyr was one of respect, admiration and affection without any doubt regarding the ascendancy of Eliade.</seg>
<seg id="27">There is really no suggestion that Radu Gyr would have ever been the superior of Eliade.</seg>
<seg id="28">Being smart, the poet who was forced to write for Glasul Patriei (The voice of the Motherland), unveils from the outset his embarrassment by signalling Eliade (who knew exactly what the mission of that publication was and was constantly denigrating the exile of people with liberal ideas) in his signature, after the writing "your old friend ", telling him about what to expect. He is visibly relieved and happy when his friend responds affectionately after almost three decades of being apart, when the "cunning time" has alienated them.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is no doubt that, beyond the "mission" he was tasked with (to persuade Eliade that now he could easily return to the new Romania at least to see his mother and friends) which he skilfully fulfills in a cold manner and in short sentences, delimited in paragraphs to suggest their foreign body character, Radu Gyr only shows his interest in literature.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were no question of esoteric allusions, exquisitely suggested political complications or any evocation of the youth years other than in a cultural manner.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's hard to believe that Radu Gyr was the legionnaire superior of Eliade, but until this version is strengthen with less circumstantial evidence like that offered by Florin Țurcanu, this correspondence shows shards of memory which testify a mutual appreciation between characters who left their different but constant marks on our culture and, beyond the terrible trials of their lives, found the spirit of the interwar civilization and education.</seg>
<seg id="32">Important human and cultural and, why not ?, exemplary documents which evoke friendship and mutual respect beyond the "time period" destiny of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the early 70s, Eliade finally gives up his refugee status and obtains US citizenship and under the pretext offered by health problems and the catastrophic flooding in the country, announces the Socialist Republic of Romania authorities, through the embassy (with which he had a sporadic correspondence in order to get a passport for his sister) that he cannot accept the invitation to return to the country.</seg>
<seg id="34">The result was predictable: he once again indexed, the "Toladot business" is carried out in Israel, the books sent to his family and friends (Fragments d'un journal, Gallimard, 1973) are ceased by the censorship and he never sees his mother again.</seg>
<seg id="35">Among all his friends who remained in the country, he only sporadically writes to Noica, although, as evidenced by the Chicago personal archive, surprisingly many individuals or Romanian institutions manage to send him messages.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is clear why Radu Gyr never received permission to write to him after 1969.</seg>
<seg id="37">After 1977, when Ceausescu's regime once again tried to convince Eliade (by official invitation, being approached by Noica, translations etc.) Radu Gyr had already passed away.</seg>

<seg id="1">New coach, foreign players</seg>
<seg id="2">Because of the scarcity of local volleyball players, Penicilina Iasi tested Serbian, Montenegrin, Bulgarian and Polish players in tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="3">The players from Iasi participate in training tournaments under the command of coach Dan Gavril</seg>
<seg id="4">Demoted from the women's volleyball A1 Division in the first half of the year, Penicilina Iasi retained its place in the first division due to the disbandment of Stiinta Miroslava, freshly promoted to the first division after a disputed qualification tournament which took place in the town of Iasi county.</seg>
<seg id="5">The news took the leadership of the group from Iasi by surprise. They found themselves without a head coach (after the departure of Rares Puni, who was now a deputy coach for Stiinta Bacau) and lacking multiple player. Some of the players were retired, like Cristina Lungu and stopper Diana Studineanu, and some were transferred, like Ana-Maria Berdila (to the champion Volei Alba Blaj) and sisters Maria and Iuliana Fica.</seg>
<seg id="6">Naturally, until the resumption of the championship scheduled on October 10, there was and still is time to complete the lot.</seg>
<seg id="7">Firstly they found a new coach, Dan Gavril, who came from the men's team LPS Piatra Neamt, and had worked in recent years with Penicilina. He is going to sign a contract with the group led by Vasile Stanga.</seg>
<seg id="8">Two players from the Stiinta Miroslava, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconita were also included in the team, and some foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland were tested. The ones closest to being transferred were the Serbian player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).</seg>
<seg id="9">Earlier this month, Penicilina led by Dan Gavril conducted a training camp in Gura Humorului, then participated in a tournament held in Lugoj whose prize was Banat Cup. The players from Iasi achieved a win (3-0 with Universitatea Cluj) but they have also suffered two losses, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.</seg>
<seg id="10">Next week, during 23-25 September, Penicilina will participate in another tournament in Craiova.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are trying to form a valuable team for the new championship.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have a skilled and experienced coach, but the number of players in Romania is quite low and therefore we resort to foreign volleyball players, especially after it was decided that teams can use any number of foreign players.</seg>
<seg id="13">This decision will affect the younger generation of athletes from clubs in Romania.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We hope to be ranked 5-6 at the end of the season, even if it is going to be very hard," said Vasile Stanga, President of ACS Penicilina Iasi.</seg>

<seg id="3">The twins George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, aged 69, were born at the end of the Second World War in Germany, after their Polish mother had just been released form a labour camp.</seg>

<seg id="1">6 ways to get rid of stress in under a minute</seg>
<seg id="2">Very few of us can afford to run for a weekend in the mountains to get rid of stress.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some of us do not have the time, the others - the finances and others both.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there are solutions available to everyone who want to escape a little from stress.</seg>
<seg id="5">They do not involve increased costs nor special time allocated, according lyla.ro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Everyday worries are inevitable, but it depends on us how we face them and the attitude we have towards them.</seg>
<seg id="7">Instead of grinding on the inside and feel as if an implosion occurs in your mind, you should try instead the following relaxation methods which only take a minute.</seg>
<seg id="8">Breathe deeply</seg>
<seg id="9">Breathing exercises are not just for soloists and yoga practitioners.</seg>
<seg id="10">They work for any person, and the adjustment of breath in a tense moment helps the release of endorphins in the body, a process that leads to a state of relaxation, informs Livestrong.</seg>
<seg id="11">Be childish</seg>
<seg id="12">We know that we have passed childhood and we cannot afford being cuddled when we feel like it.</seg>
<seg id="13">But that does not mean we cannot go in a corner of the office building or anywhere we know we're alone (even behind the building) and scream from the top of our lungs.</seg>
<seg id="14">You can get rid of nerves and negative energy accumulated during the day with a few strong screams.</seg>
<seg id="15">Imagine a beautiful place</seg>
<seg id="16">We know that this is worthy of a psychotherapy session, but psychologists use it often for a reason.</seg>
<seg id="17">Imagining a beautiful place that inspires calm and detachment from the daily frenzy could alleviate the nervous state.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is, indeed, about self-suggestion, process which can really change lives, both for better or worse.</seg>
<seg id="19">It all depends on what we self-suggest.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is best to think of an idyllic place that warms our soul.</seg>
<seg id="21">Listen to music</seg>
<seg id="22">Put your headphones on and listen to relaxing music.</seg>
<seg id="23">Please note however that we are not talking about your favourite music, because if this happens to be heavy metal, you might find it difficult to relax.</seg>
<seg id="24">Listen to soft relaxing tunes without lyrics to find your balance when you become angry.</seg>
<seg id="25">Peel an orange</seg>
<seg id="26">Does it sound strange to peel an orange when you are nervous?</seg>
<seg id="27">Well, it doesn't!</seg>

<seg id="1">Hora and rock with a violin and guitar</seg>
<seg id="2">Two musicians in love with instruments somewhat rivals but partners in this acoustic project sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzolla, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, and famous pieces of Romanian folklore by combining the violin and guitar.</seg>
<seg id="3">The acoustic project belongs to musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is named WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, according to hotnews.ro.</seg>
<seg id="4">Florentin: "We have found each other, and we have enjoyed very much since then playing together, having a virtually unlimited repertoire".</seg>
<seg id="5">We thought that this is the moment when a violin met a guitar.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cristi: "From the first meeting we discovered that what we play sounds very good and that, in terms of the human component, things are working".</seg>
<seg id="7">Each of us learned the repertoire of the other under way and, what is very important is that the sounds of the two instruments fit.</seg>
<seg id="8">Florentin: "I know there is a gap between the classical musicians and the rest."</seg>
<seg id="9">I think many people can listen to classical music.</seg>
<seg id="10">And secondly we can still play Queen, Deep Purple, our old rock songs and of course, jazz.</seg>
<seg id="11">We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that might make those who listen only to classical music listen also to rock music and those who listen only to rock music get to like classical music as well.</seg>
<seg id="12">And we were surprised to be told at the end of a concert that people never imagined they will hear something like that and that they might like it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Students from Iasi spent more time in traffic than at school on the first day of school after the holiday</seg>
<seg id="2">Hundreds of Iasi citizens were "trapped" yesterday morning in the hellish traffic from several areas.</seg>
<seg id="3">The City Hall announced today that Mangeron Boulevard (Bahlui street, left embankment) will be closed between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Ros.</seg>
<seg id="4">The heads of City Hall failed to achieve their promise to perform works for the smooth flow of road traffic with the onset of the school year.</seg>
<seg id="5">One of the assurances given by the municipality at least twice in recent weeks, was the reinstatement of the roundabout from the International Railway Station area.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although only a few interim elements had to be installed and the last deadline for the performance of the works was the past weekend, the roundabout was inexistent yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The drivers nerves were stretched to the maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir streets, given that another promise of the City Hall was broken: the transfer of the customs service from Nicolae Iorga Street to Tehnopolis "no later than the end of August", although this transfer is discussed since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, Acting Mayor Michael Chirica says that the problem from the International Railway Station is more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="9">The roundabout will be made at the appropriate time, we must consider the trams traffic in the area, and we also need an approval from the National Roads.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's not like Zimbru where there is time for the tram to turn in the roundabout, but we will solve it somehow," said Chirica.</seg>
<seg id="11">One solution, according to him, would be stopping the tram with a traffic light stop before the turn.</seg>
<seg id="12">Problems in traffic were also in the intersection of Podu Ros.</seg>
<seg id="13">The car line on Sfantul Lazar Street stretched until the Romanian Secret Service headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I waited several minutes to get out of Podu Ros," said one of Iasi citizens.</seg>
<seg id="15">In September the trams should have passed on Podu Ros to CUG if the rehabilitation project "Development and Rehabilitation of South Functional Artery" was completed within the initial execution term (July 31, 2015).</seg>
<seg id="16">In that case, there are two projects which complement the initial one.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We have obtained European funding for new works, like an expansion, as the original version of Nicolina passage was too narrow" commented Chirica.</seg>
<seg id="18">The latest deadline for reintroducing tram traffic is October.</seg>
<seg id="19">Yesterday, people from Iasi reported traffic problems especially in areas like Pacurari, Center (Targu Cucu, Independenței, Armenian Street) or the intersection of Base 3.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Court Judges will decide tomorrow whether the legal restrictions pending trial and prohibitions of the suspended President of the County Council will be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Magistrates of Iasi Court settled yesterday a new hearing in the "Album" case in which the suspended President of Iasi County Council is also a party.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the end of yesterday's hearing, the magistrates decided to give their resolution sometime tomorrow on the measure of the judicial review currently imposed against Adomniței.</seg>

<seg id="1">Other 3500 Iasi citizens are expected to vote until September 25th</seg>
<seg id="2">The City Hall is prepared to distribute other surveys, if the 12,000 forms will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="3">The people from Iasi have only ten days to express an opinion on the replanting of linden trees on Stefan cel Mare pedestrian crossing.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to municipal officials, 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed to district centres and three additional points in the city (Copou Park, Alexandru cel Bun Esplanade and the City Hall) have been filled out to date.</seg>
<seg id="5">A record number of Iasi citizens came Sunday in front of the City Hall.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the representatives of the civic group "Iași loves linden trees", 530 Iasi citizens voted in 140 minutes or almost four votes each minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">Instead, throughout Monday, about 440 Iasi citizens came in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="8">Group volunteers say that many Iasi citizens criticise the inefficient advertising and popularization of public consultation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, they called yesterday to internet users to print an information poster provided by the group and stick it on building entrances.</seg>
<seg id="10">Volunteers also said that at the additional point in Copou park, the last forms were filled out by the people of Iasi on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will provide forms from the district centres, where not many are being filled out.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We will make further additions when all 12,000 forms will be filled out," the municipality spokesman Sebastian Buraga said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The Linden Survey" will end on September 25, and if the majority of the people of Iasi's vote is in favour of replanting the trees then the City Hall will plant silver lindens this fall.</seg>
<seg id="14">The people from Iasi may express their opinion in the district centres of Dacia, Frumoasa, Tătărași, Nicolina and Păcurari, as well as in the additional points mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Heads of The City Hall decided the cutting of linden trees on Stefan cel Mare Street in early 2013, an action that resulted in a fine of 60,000 lei for the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="16">The decision was taken unilaterally, without consultation with the population, and led to the spontaneous establishment of the civic group "Iași loves linden trees", an online community comprising approximately 13,500 people.</seg>
<seg id="17">Online, a petition initiated by the civic group for the replanting of linden trees was signed, until yesterday evening, by over 9,100 supporters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Drivers fear their car wheels will get stuck in the cracks on the Tudor Vladimirescu bridge</seg>
<seg id="2">The Bridge over Bahlui on Tudor Vladimirescu Boulevard remained as full of depressions as when "Ziarul de Iasi" wrote about its problems 10 days ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">Our daily newspaper reporters presented at the time that the asphalt began to sink at the line demarcating the two lanes and deep cavities appeared, some even 20 centimetres deep, through which the concrete plates representing the primary infrastructure of the bridge can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moreover, the asphalt started to crack on each side of the axis, and there are signs that the depressions will increase.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the time, the acting mayor Mihai Chirica said that the bridge has no structural problems, a technical expertise being performed recently in order to start a project to rehabilitate the bridge and tram rail, in the amount of 5 million euro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mayor Chirica stated that the area affected by cracks and cavities will be signalled, and asphalt rehabilitation works will be performed soon.</seg>
<seg id="7">But so far the only measure taken was the installation of some posts and a signalling lane, without even a simple filling.</seg>
<seg id="8">During this period, we focused more on the opening of the school year and the works necessary for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="9">"A punctual expertise of the bridge is under way which we expect to be ready in about a week with the necessary details for the intervention. I think that in no more than two weeks we could move on to rectify the situation" said the Acting Mayor.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">At the beginning of the school year</seg>
<seg id="2">Yesterday, my eldest son, Ștefan, started school.</seg>
<seg id="3">Preparatory school year, as he attempts to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="4">I do not know whether to rejoice or let melancholy overwhelm me; I passively tend towards the latter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Firstly, I feel it's only been three weeks, not three years since I first took him to the kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although relieved, no normal parent feels joy that his children grow up.</seg>
<seg id="7">Secondly, because I perfectly remember the same day from my childhood; it was then when a story began which, ironically, has not ended to this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">I wasn't what you would usually call a conscientious student.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the contrary, I would say.</seg>
<seg id="10">But I always liked school.</seg>
<seg id="11">So much that I chose to continue attending, even if as a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="12">When I decided that's what I want to do my whole life, I knew it was not an easy job.</seg>
<seg id="13">And it's not one where the stake is small.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's because, like all of us, I myself encountered all kinds of teachers: better or worse, nice or obnoxious, smarter or downright idiotic.</seg>
<seg id="15">Unfortunately, there are people with other callings in this craft.</seg>
<seg id="16">I think they are toxic because they violate the enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to develop.</seg>
<seg id="17">When I was a pupil I was lucky to have a few exceptional teachers.</seg>
<seg id="18">These encounters can be decisive if they happen at the appropriate time.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who believes that the role of the person behind the desk is to trivially transmit information is entirely wrong.</seg>
<seg id="20">This can be done by anyone; any student can search from information by himself, we only live in the era of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="21">A good teacher shapes the mind of his students.</seg>
<seg id="22">He forms them, he influences their way of thinking.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sitting behind the desk is not a privilege, as a lot of people believe, but a great responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="24">Young people are very picky, demanding, unforgiving and always willing to look for flaws in those who are front of them.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their age and temperament demand it.</seg>
<seg id="26">As teenagers, we all thought we knew everything, we had unwavering certainty about anything.</seg>
<seg id="27">When we grow up, we realize that all we have is doubts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Therefore, the role of a teacher is to shake the teenager out of his categorical self-sufficiency and make him think.</seg>
<seg id="29">That is to learn, to doubt, to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="30">To discover answers on their own, even if the answers are provisional.</seg>
<seg id="31">To get involved in everything he does.</seg>
<seg id="32">To discreetly direct him towards profitable models.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's very difficult, especially because the student often thinks the teacher is his enemy.</seg>
<seg id="34">Someone who is just waiting to catch him off guard and penalize him.</seg>
<seg id="35">This entitles him, the eternally misunderstood, rebellious student, obliged to fully live the callings of his age, to look with suspicion towards the person behind the desk.</seg>
<seg id="36">He can't naturally just accept the attempts to discipline him.</seg>
<seg id="37">Teenagers don't just let others place them in their place, they do not accept restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="38">Or, if they give the impression that they do, they somehow retaliate.</seg>
<seg id="39">And unfortunately, when a rigid person is behind the desk who imposes respect through hardness and does not communicate, students take vengeance on the taught subject.</seg>
<seg id="40">There are thousands of such adolescents who miss encountering great writers, for instance, due to the lack of tact of the Romanian teacher.</seg>
<seg id="41">There are thousands of such students who think that history is a sequence of data, that mathematics is all that can be more tiring for their immature minds.</seg>
<seg id="42">I always urge my students: if you encounter a teacher you cannot stand, who doesn't know how to communicate, do not let him get drive you away from literature. He should drive you towards it.</seg>
<seg id="43">How did it happened that I myself became a teacher?</seg>
<seg id="44">I had a very good teacher in secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="45">He opened my mind to some texts which spoke to the pubescent student and he understood.</seg>
<seg id="46">In high school I also met a university professor who opened his library door to me.</seg>
<seg id="47">I looked at him and saw man from another world: his house's walls were covered with shelves crammed with books.</seg>
<seg id="48">I lost myself in his library and dreamed about owning one myself.</seg>
<seg id="49">Now I do, but if fate hadn't crossed our paths, maybe I would have decided to become a football player.</seg>
<seg id="50">Or an engineer or a lawyer or who knows what.</seg>
<seg id="51">I do not think such encounters are coincidental.</seg>
<seg id="52">I do not believe in chance.</seg>
<seg id="53">It is vital to bump into the man who is going to take you by the hand and lead you towards his own vocation.</seg>
<seg id="54">That person is often the teacher.</seg>
<seg id="55">Now, my experience helps me to only talk about what it means to teach literature.</seg>
<seg id="56">The only thing is that literature cannot be thought.</seg>
<seg id="57">There is no such thing as a literature professor, as there is a math teacher.</seg>
<seg id="58">How can you fix the ineffable in concepts?</seg>
<seg id="59">You can, at best, approximate it, without claiming that you convey unquestionable truths.</seg>
<seg id="60">The man behind the desk can be a guide at most, telling you what to read. That's something else.</seg>
<seg id="61">But above all, he can create the opportunity for some miraculous encounters between a reader and some books.</seg>
<seg id="62">These are encounters that can change the life of the student.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are encounter that can open his mind, who can raise the scales from his eyes, as someone once said.</seg>
<seg id="64">Therefore, the literature teacher should firstly make his students understand (feel) that between literature and life there can never be a divorce.</seg>
<seg id="65">Quite the contrary!</seg>
<seg id="66">A great conversationalist, Alexandru Paleologu states something that is apparently paradoxical: "The more literature there is, the more life exists, not the other way around!" , and he was right.</seg>
<seg id="67">Therefore, a good teacher prepares you for life, he does not make you a specialist in a field which is open anyway.</seg>
<seg id="68">Fortunately, we have always something to learn.</seg>
<seg id="69">Us teachers too; or better said mostly us, the teachers.</seg>
<seg id="70">Most times, a great truth only repeats itself due to inertia: not only do disciples have something to learn from their masters, but also vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="71">Ideally, the teacher should be a master and the student an apprentice.</seg>
<seg id="72">As any successful young man, he leaves his master when he discovers his own path.</seg>
<seg id="73">The truth is that few of them find it.</seg>
<seg id="74">But the master was the one who lit the spark.</seg>
<seg id="75">I do not think there is greater happiness for a thoroughbred teacher than to endure as many such separations as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2">A Syrian artist has created a refugee version of the popular game "Super Mario", evoking the predicament of his countrymen on their way to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">Instead of presenting the adventures of Italian plumber Mario in the Mushroom Kingdom, the modified video game centres around "refugee Mario".</seg>
<seg id="4">The character attempts to pass human smugglers and then border police on his way to a refugee centre in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artist settled now in Istanbul uses the pseudonym Samir al-Mufti for security reasons and said he made the video game centred around refugee Mario after his friends ventured into a perilous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of war.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Craiova Detention Centre, the youngest student is 15 years old and he is in the 1st grade</seg>
<seg id="2">The Minister of Justice Robert Cazanciuc stated at the opening of the school year at Craiova Detention Centre that the youngest student is 15 years old and that he is in the 1st grade, and the oldest is 25 years old and in the XIth grade. He also added that that they could have had another life if they had gone to school.</seg>
<seg id="3">I chose to attend the opening of the school year in one of the National Penitentiary Administration's Centres to draw the attention on some lesser known facts.</seg>
<seg id="4">The youngest student, aged 15, is enrolled in the 1st grade and the oldest is 25 years old and is enrolled in the XIth grade.</seg>
<seg id="5">"There are complicated subjects which society is keen to discuss at this time, we are all oppressed by our own worries and problems, but we should not overlook the lesson that these 100 young people from Craiova Detention Centre offer," said Minister Robert Cazanciuc on Monday at the opening ceremony of the school year.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Minister of Justice pointed out that lack of education, motivated in many cases by the lack of financial resources, can lead to tragedy, stating that the youth in this centre might have had another chance in life if they had followed the natural school course of every child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only how to write, to read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to find out what it means to abide by the law and the consequences of not doing so.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The role of the prison system is not to permanently isolate from society the people who break the law, to imprison them behind high walls, but to try to re-educate and prepare them so that when they return into community they have more chances of reintegration" added Cazanciuc.</seg>
<seg id="8">The minister said it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, and roads, but investments must also be made in the prison system because in many cases, the imprisonment conditions are at the limit of humanity and if there is a lack of money and personnel, it will be difficult to speak of reintegration of convicted persons.</seg>
<seg id="9">We work very well with the Ministry of Education and through this partnership, every year, over 2000 people in the prison system graduate school training courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Obviously, we will not change overnight what has not been done in 25 years, but we have made great strides.</seg>
<seg id="11">"For all these efforts we also need the support of society, and this support cannot come unless we prove that we do our duty, that through your work these teenagers have an opportunity and do not pose a threat to society" said Cazanciuc.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Minister of Justice wished both the students and educators good luck, showing that success comes only through the combined efforts of all the parties involved.</seg>
<seg id="13">"And because today is the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, I would like to invite all students and teachers to visit the mausoleums of Soveja, Mărăști, among other objectives, to understand what the young people's fight for ideals means," stated Robert Cazanciuc.</seg>

<seg id="1">Doctoral schools caught with more than two plagiaries to be dissolved!</seg>
<seg id="2">Petition of prestigious academic persons from Iasi and the rest of the country</seg>
<seg id="3">Over 200 researchers, academics, staff and students in the country have signed a petition launched by the Academic Society of Romania in which they request the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research, to evaluate, sanction and even dissolve the Romanian doctoral schools "which allow and promote academic imposture".</seg>
<seg id="4">The signatories of the petition launched on September 10 include teachers and professors in Iasi.</seg>
<seg id="5">Among the academics who have signed the petition from the academic field of Iasi, is Prof. Liviu Antonesei, PhD.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nationally, the petition was signed by former ministers of Education, such as Mircea Miclea, literati who are also university professors such as Andrei Plesu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Although the Education Law provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been done so far, resulting in a lack of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools flagrantly violating ethical standards of scientific research and which do not produce relevant and internationally recognized performance" is stated in the petition.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the said petition it is specifically required the compliance with the National Education Law, the evaluation of doctoral schools and suspension of operation for any doctoral school in which more than two plagiaries are found, until the assessment and remedy of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last requirement is the suspension of operation for any doctoral school where the minimum number of scientific advisors provided by law who meet the criteria of the National Scientific Research Council in 2011 for eligibility to IDEA type projects grants does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="10">Do you respect less a general without a PhD, or a politician, or an intelligence agent in the Middle East?</seg>
<seg id="11">"Why are there not in Europe other academies which have PhD organized by secret services? And why do top military members who obtain their PhD do this in autonomous institutions, where the quality is verified by academics?" stated Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academic Society, initiator of the petition, who also comes from Iasi.</seg>
<seg id="12">This can be filled in by all interested parties on the website of the Society, and the final signatures will be submitted by the organization to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.</seg>

<seg id="1">We are not looking for 3 men with money, but 10,000 men who want to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="2">The "Pentru Iasi" party, founded by young IT managers with no political affiliations, made its debut the day before yesterday in Copou Park.</seg>
<seg id="3">The chairman of the "Pentru Iasi" Initiative Group gave an interview to "Ziarul de Iasi"</seg>
<seg id="4">Iasi will have a party exclusively dedicated to the development of the city.</seg>
<seg id="5">A group of entrepreneurs and managers with no political affiliations established the For Iasi party last week, an organization which will propose candidates in the local elections of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="6">Currently, the core of the party consists of IT specialists, but the founder of the he party says that the organization welcomes all the individuals who want to be involved in the modernization of the city.</seg>
<seg id="7">The party was announced on Saturday in Copou park, and the event was attended by over 200 supporters, nearly all of them being young people.</seg>
<seg id="8">The special guest of the event was Nicușor Dan, the president of Salvați Bucureștiul Association.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was the surprise of the local elections in 2012 when, as an independent candidate, he managed to obtain 10% of the votes of Bucharest's citizens in the race for mayor.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I think the people in the "Pentru Iasi" party are very adequate to be appointed in the public administration of Iasi".</seg>
<seg id="11">I believe in this initiative, I think is has a chance for success, and I think it is better suited for a smaller community than that of Bucharest.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I will always support "Pentru Iasi""said Dan Nicușor.</seg>
<seg id="13">ZDI: Why haven't you left Iasi to work in an IT company from abroad?</seg>
<seg id="14">Andrei Postolache: My reasons are rather sentimental and emotional.</seg>
<seg id="15">I was away in many short business trips, I have also lived in Cluj for a year.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have always come back, because I felt that this is my home.</seg>
<seg id="17">ZDI: Why did you decide to start a political party?</seg>
<seg id="18">Andrei Postolache: We've reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who got to know each other for a while.</seg>
<seg id="19">We met in a professional context and began discussing ways in which we could get involved.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the beginning, our involvement was a little shy, we got engaged in smaller projects, with NGOs, various municipal or charitable actions, and somehow things evolved naturally and organically and now we happened to decide that we need to get involved more.</seg>
<seg id="21">ZDI: Name three concrete projects to streamline the local public administration!</seg>
<seg id="22">Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimum informatization of the City Hall activities so that the various departments, institutions and administrations are able to better cooperate.</seg>
<seg id="23">But, more importantly, to be able to publish transparent data about the detailed activities: budgets, reports, projects, etc. We are talking about information organization.</seg>
<seg id="24">The second project would be transparency because it leads to efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="25">If you have a project in a particular neighbourhood, it is important to publically consult the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="26">If we are talking about efficiency, we must not forget public transportation. We have the worst busses in the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">We must purchase new means of transportation.</seg>
<seg id="28">ZDI: Today, a city's image is very important.</seg>
<seg id="29">How would you promote Iasi?</seg>
<seg id="30">Andrei Postolache: You board a plane and search for investors.</seg>
<seg id="31">There are conferences, industry events where you can "sell" the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">You have to want to do it and know how to do it.</seg>
<seg id="33">And here we have an advantage: our background is business and we have brought customers to Iasi.</seg>
<seg id="34">What is the brand of Iasi?</seg>
<seg id="35">Andrei Postolache: In my opinion, this city needs to be technological, in one way or another.</seg>
<seg id="36">We already have the IT industry and we need to expand it, to get involved in medicine, robotics, 3D printing, to continue in this spirit and merge these elements.</seg>
<seg id="37">I think the brand should be in the area of science, and I'm referring to the modern brand of the city.</seg>
<seg id="38">Of course, Iasi's brand is already history, and it should not be changed. Iasi should remain a cultural city.</seg>
<seg id="39">I see two elements in balance: culture and technology.</seg>
<seg id="40">ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures that still win elections in Romania?</seg>
<seg id="41">Andrei Postolache: The administration is a form of management which means organization, planning, communication, working with people and developing projects.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have experience in management.</seg>
<seg id="43">We do not want traditional structures, we are not interested in those.</seg>
<seg id="44">We want to involve the people. We will talk to everyone, and we do not intend to remain present only on Facebook. We're not an online party.</seg>
<seg id="45">We do not want "volunteers" who were forced into buses and brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="46">That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we believe that there are enough people like this.</seg>
<seg id="47">ZDI: Should the mayor of Iasi be more concerned with the national and international promotion of the city, or is it necessary for the scope of the concerns to be continuously municipal in nature?</seg>
<seg id="48">Andrei Postolache: You can't have one without the other, it will not work.</seg>
<seg id="49">The first things that you need to solve are the problems of the day, the emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="50">Or, if you do not make your city known, if you do not draw money to the city, at some point you are going to run out of money and you won't be able to build streets for example.</seg>
<seg id="51">You need both things simultaneously and you need competent people around you.</seg>
<seg id="52">The mayor shouldn't do everything.</seg>
<seg id="53">We must give up the chief/mayor model who drives his fist through the wall and solves everything.</seg>
<seg id="54">No.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are a team.</seg>
<seg id="56">The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="57">ZDI: Will you try to attract business men from the IT industry to the party to financially support the organisation?</seg>
<seg id="58">Andrei Postolache: We are seeking people who want to do something good, to have a spotless reputation, to have integrity and honour.</seg>
<seg id="59">From this point of view, we have no other filters.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are not looking for three men with money, we're looking for 10,000 men, or, why not, 300,000 men who want to get involved and do something for the town.</seg>
<seg id="61">Interview by Alex ANDREI</seg>
<seg id="62">Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for nearly 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="63">In July 2015 he founded Introspecials. Before this was a director of the Endava international concern for seven years (2008 to 2015), where he led a team of 300 people.</seg>
<seg id="64">He spent another four years (2003 - 2007) at Synygy.</seg>
<seg id="65">The company that he founded along with another IT specialist provides management consulting services.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Tractor "Scrappage" Program, a failure</seg>
<seg id="2">The General Manager of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Oltean, said that the program to stimulate the renewal of the national park of tractors and agricultural machinery, initiated in 2011, also called the Tractor Scrappage Program, was a failure due to bureaucracy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Regarding the Scrappage program, there were some attempts in recent years, but it turned out to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for an ordinary farmer and the approvals took too long, so people gave up.</seg>
<seg id="4">Through that program about 10 pieces were sold.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The need of tractors for the Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," said Mircea Oltean.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to him, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors annually, being the largest company of this kind in Romania, and that greater competition is exercised by foreign companies, who know the Romanian market needs.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is a huge competition with those coming from abroad, all global manufacturers have set their sights on Romania, I know what I am saying, and they have special policies.</seg>
<seg id="8">"There is huge cram at all the fairs, all the manufacturers come with all sorts of variations" said Mircea Oltean, who said that IRUM Reghin manufactures around 500 agricultural tractors and forestry tractors a year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Through the Tractor Scrappage Program, initiated in 2011, those who own old tractors or other self-propelled means of transport, such as harvesters, could hand them over and receive in exchange a voucher for 17,000 lei.</seg>

<seg id="1">The red flag has been risen</seg>
<seg id="2">The internal ballot of the Labour Party looks spectacular and politically significant, particularly as the newly elected leader is automatically spearheading in the upcoming election.</seg>
<seg id="3">Then raise the scarlet standard high / Beneath its folds we'll live and die</seg>
<seg id="4">That is what yesterday Jeremy Corbyn sang in the London pub Sanctuary House.</seg>
<seg id="5">It witnessed many a deed and vow / We must not change its colour now</seg>
<seg id="6">Readers who are not familiar with the melody of this unofficial British and international leftist anthem (The Red Flag) can search the Internet they might have a surprise.</seg>
<seg id="7">With heads uncovered swear we all / To bare it onward till we fall</seg>
<seg id="8">The author of these lines is not a fan of red flags (or of flaunting flags), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.</seg>
<seg id="9">If Jeremy Corbyn will be able to unite yesterday left with tomorrow left, this love story between him and the basis of the Labour Party will have a happy ending.</seg>
<seg id="10">I do not think it would happen so, but it seems premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat five years from now, of a leader who was elected yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="11">Now, however, we can make reference to the procedures: we have witnessed a democratic exercise at an impressive scale.</seg>
<seg id="12">The direct voting system was not invented by the Labour Party among the Western left for their leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">French socialists have been practicing a more complicated system based on motion for several years. This system allows all members and supporters to express themselves; In addition, they held a preliminary competition for the 2012 nomination of the presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, the internal ballot of the Labour Party looks spectacular and politically significant, particularly as the newly elected leader is automatically spearheading in the upcoming election.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is of course also a political system matter, the personalization of power is more pronounced in the UK than on the other side of the English Channel.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, voter turnout was high in all three "circles": the actual members, union members and other organizations affiliated to the party, and finally, the group of sympathizers (who received the ballot paper after a brief registration procedure).</seg>
<seg id="17">The latter group gives us interesting information about the perceptions of the left segments of the British society, especially those made of young or middle-aged educated individuals, interested in the political phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="18">Many will choose to be involved further in the future because of the signal provided by Corbyn's victory.</seg>
<seg id="19">As far as I know, there are no sociological surveys that tell us much about the attitudes of the Labour Party's "outer circle" so cautious speculation is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="20">I think we can find enough attitudes similar to those of Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece) supporters, noting that they will go through the traditional channels of the left.</seg>
<seg id="21">If we really want to identify an "anti-system" vocation, it is primarily reflected by the rejection of the centrist line, New Labour (for many, a disguised form of the much abused Thatcherism).</seg>
<seg id="22">The second component would be the repudiation of leaders who are considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one of the arguments being that did they were not leftist enough, not being firmly delineated from the Tony Blair era.</seg>
<seg id="23">The second reference frame - in my opinion, which is more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum for independence in Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ignoring the separatist message and strictly focusing on the aspirations on other political issues, we see that Scottish nationalists have captured the energy of audience segments which are favourable for social status and animated by the aspiration of fairness. The audience are the followers of disarmament and hostile to military involvement abroad, but also sensitive to the new fears of the left: ecology, gender, support of the poor countries.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thus, the Scottish Labour Party has lost an electorate that should have privileged access, at least in principle, but who can now be recovered (see their enthusiasm in campaign's Corbyn).</seg>
<seg id="26">Such energy can be found everywhere in the UK, but the old leadership has not been able to attract it.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the vocation of an outsider, Jeremy Corbyn has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, the Labour Party "aristocrat".</seg>
<seg id="28">I believe the comparison with Scotland tells us more than the one with the anti-system left in Europe's southern periphery.</seg>
<seg id="29">The term "anti-system" is too harsh: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="30">By next week we would have learned more about the first steps of Jeremy Corbyn as the leader of the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="31">We will see whether the red flag will resonate in the House of Commons (it would not be the first time), after the new leader will be ranked in the first row of the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, what Jeremy Corbyn wants right now from his colleagues in the Parliament is primarily unity - and in this respect he really has a reason to be worried.</seg>

<seg id="1">The manipulation trap with or without deliberate knowledge</seg>
<seg id="2">While I was writing the article it occurred to me to check the internet for the story of the ex-militant and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" who became "jihadists Laith Al-Saleh" in the second part of the article dedicated to him by V. Marin (the two categorizations - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could have made me cautious from the start).</seg>
<seg id="3">I didn't check.</seg>
<seg id="4">In last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") I commented these two pictures in parallel - one depicting little Aylan Kurdi who was found dead on the shores of the Mediterranean and one, actually two: depicting Syrian Laith Al-Saleh one as a fighter, the other as a refugee.</seg>
<seg id="5">I took over the story of Laith Al-Saleh from the "Syrian fighters mixed among the refugees" article (by Viorica Marin, published in the Adevarul issue of September 3).</seg>
<seg id="6">On Monday evening, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Tuesday, once I logged in to my Facebook account, I found, among other things, a scolding comment from my friend (also in real life) Cristian: "I subscribe. I only have one remark: Laith al Saleh is not a jihadist".</seg>
<seg id="8">On the contrary, he fights against Al Assad, for democracy ... and so on.</seg>
<seg id="9">"So you could have also mentioned the gross manipulation from the image"!</seg>
<seg id="10">I must admit, it sucked.</seg>
<seg id="11">The more so as that, while I was writing the article it occurred to me to check the internet for the story of the ex-militant and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" who became "jihadists Laith Al-Saleh" in the second part of the article dedicated to him by V. Marin (the two categorizations - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could have made me cautious from the start).</seg>
<seg id="12">This happened because I trusted Adevarul and its journalists.</seg>
<seg id="13">Still, I didn't have anything to comment to the scolding of Marius Cristian other than: "This is what I get for trusting (having trusted) Adevarul"</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, I obviously began to study the story closely and I feel indebted to the readers, owing them a fair presentation of the story of Syrian Laith Al-Saleh.</seg>
<seg id="15">The oldest information I could find was a story by the Associated Press (Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett of 17 August 2015, about a man on the island of Kos in Greece, where he was noticed among hundreds, maybe thousands of refugees, who was trying to bring order to the chaos of the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="16">The man was the Syrian Laith Al Saleh from Alep. He "is used to being in control", since he "led a unit of 700 rebels in the civil war in Syria".</seg>
<seg id="17">I also found out that Al Saleh, aged 30, had "a house, a wife and a normal life before the fighting began. The war ended over 250,000 lives and left one third of Syria's population homeless".</seg>
<seg id="18">In the interview given to the Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh says that "everyone wants to leave Syria".</seg>
<seg id="19">My city is the most dangerous city in the world.</seg>
<seg id="20">About 70% of the city is in ruins.</seg>
<seg id="21">In Syria, I am wanted by Al Qaeda, Daesh (an extremist group of the Islamic State), the government - I have fought against them all.</seg>
<seg id="22">Beyond the fact that he was kicked out of a supermarket on the island, it seems Kos offered him "an even more sinister encounter - a man in which he recognized a Syrian enemy": "Two days ago, I saw a sniper from the government forces."</seg>
<seg id="23">I did not talk to him, but I'm still very upset.</seg>
<seg id="24">The article also tells us that Laith (meaning lion in Arabic) was indeed on his way to Holland, to one of his cousins - a former senior officer in the Syrian army who also became a rebel and reached the West after being seriously injured - hoping to obtain asylum and eventually bring his family - his wife and a three year old boy (almost as old as the civil war in Syria, which broke out in March 2011).</seg>
<seg id="25">Once he manages to do this, we can't rule out that Laith Al-Saleh is going to return to Syria to continue fighting for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (backed by Russia), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, an Al-Qaeda affiliate.</seg>
<seg id="26">It's crazy - those who want freedom in Syria must fight against three enemies, not one!</seg>
<seg id="27">I also came across a Serbian article from August 22, of which I did not understand much, just that Laith Saleh is associated with terrorists that are mixed among the migrants: "TERORISTI SE KRIJU MEĐU MIGRANTIMA" is the title of a news article from http://www.telegraf.rs/vesti, in which I found a picture of the bearded Al Saleh holding a Syrian flag in his hand and one of him as a refugee wearing that "THANK YOU" shirt.</seg>
<seg id="28">On 7 September, on the BBC website, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of manipulation in which pictures of the Syrian fighter are used: This viral photo falsely claims to show an IS fighter posing as a refugee.</seg>
<seg id="29">We find out that the picture (actually: pictures - the one in which Laith has a beard and a gun and the one with the THANK YOU shirt) was published by a user on Facebook. That user allegedly apologized in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="30">But before this happened, just from his Facebook wall the image containing the two pictures was shared over 70,000 times, getting thousands of comments.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thus the saying: too late, there's nothing you can do about it.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Romania, on September 9, Carla Dinu of Hotnews picks up the manipulation story from BBC, although the title is erroneously translated: "A fake photo which has become viral shows an ISIS fighter posing as a refugee".</seg>
<seg id="33">Obviously, the picture is not a fake, but the interpretation was false, wrong, in short: manipulative.</seg>
