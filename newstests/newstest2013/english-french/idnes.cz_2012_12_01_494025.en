Poland and the Cosmos.
Last week the council of ministers of the European Space Agency admitted Poland as the twentieth member of the agency, being the second nation from the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became a fully fledged member of the ESA on the 12th of November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects.
Of course, Poland's path to the space had begun much earlier.
Polish boffins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War, but were not always met with understanding.
I look back, for instance, to the lecture of A Sternfeld in Warsaw's astronomy observatory, who, on the 6th of December 1933, presented ideas on his pioneering work Entry into space.
The thoughts of the young engineer (born 1905) left his audience cold, and years later Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown an interest in his work.
In 1934, for his work Entry into space, Sternfeld received the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch prize in France.
The above mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a strong promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals, and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects.
Gadomski became a world-known promoter of astronautics and his contribution was, notably, recognised when a crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
In 1925, Poland had already built a handcar which was supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, both the project's designer, and the project's details, are unknown.
It is not even clear, whether the rocket was intended to start the handcar or to slow it down.
Information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time.
In 1933 the Polish artillery started their engagement in flying bombs.
The research was undertaken by the Weapons Technology Division in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzycki.
From the documents, it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests.
Of course, the advance of the German army interrupted the research.
In 1937, the concept of a photoelectric homing rocket designed by engineer Rohozinski appeared in the trade press, and in the following year The Rocket - air torpedo and flying rocket-bomb appeared, authored by Leliwy-Krywoblocki.
Both projects were destined for military use of rocket engines.
Immediately prior to the War, all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Board (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) that coordinated all the work.
The Board was appointed in 1937, but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War.
Further work devoted to astronautics appeared in the Polish Press after the War thanks to the Polish Astronautics Company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine Problems in 1954, in which four in-depth articles are on the subject of astronautics.
In one of these, by Prof. Subotowicz, the establishment of a company is proposed, which would dedicate itself to astronautics.
At the time, there were already projects underway for artificial satellites and it was clear that cosmic research was an emerging sector.
From the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Company (PTA) sought entry to the International Astronautics Federation (est. 1951) and by autumn the PTA was already a full member.
In the following year, the PTA's first chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) was appointed Deputy Chairman for the International Astronautics Federation.
He served in this capacity until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA played a significant role in the successful development of meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to enable scientific research.
The first RM-1 model was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on the 10th of October 1958.
The rocket, with a ceiling of 1800 metres, measured around 80 cm in length and weighed a little under 5 kg.
Later, the improved RM-1A version was constructed and in the summer of 1959 launch tests were initiated for the two-stage RM-2 rocket in the Bledowsky Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres in length and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development model was designed for real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to reach 14.5 km and be tasked with monitoring high altitude winds.
Of course, in 1962 further research was stopped.
The successor to the RM rocket type was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B, and -1C), which differed in the room available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, a space of 0.4 litres was available, Meteor-1B had 0.34 litres, and Meteor-1C had 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three models was 37km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the development of Meteor-2 was underway in the Aeronautics Institute, with its first launch tests in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg, and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60km.
Subsequently built models were the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
Poland's admission to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 should be mentioned, as well as the appointment of a national COSPAR board two years later.
Poland also participated in the Interkosmos space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remkov.
