Israel: Chaos Lab.
"Nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could," from Sting's Fragile, where one of the main verses from the refrain is "Lest we forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want war, there would be none," said the dying Gutle Schnapper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, as always, has sparked a lot of reaction.
Some stand by Israel, arguing it has the right to self-defence, and Palestinians are portrayed as terrorists, while others support the Palestinians, claiming racism by the Israeli state, claiming that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Arabs, and that Israel is a terrorist state.
I do not want to dwell, in these repeated periodic waves of killing, on who is the transgressor and who is the victim, after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation, and did not live through the start of the violence.
I would like to offer the readers a peek behind the scenes, a look at whom, most of all, this 95-year long tension is serving (starting from Balfour's declaration in November 1917) on this small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts, while others are derived from my own understanding of who, that is, which group of people is the main source of events in modern history.
Human history is in the first instance about the struggle for power.
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people, who had chosen their path independently, or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre-calculated goal.
We must accept that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of wealth and the power it exudes could not happen in one generation's lifespan.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out, which could be considered the puppet master (whether someone else stands above them, I am unsure, but I would not rule it out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 90's of the 19th century, in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high criminality, which appeared in their background and which always meant securing power, increasing wealth, or both.
They hold majority stakes in almost every central bank in the world, and against the countries, where they do not hold a stake, they are either waging or preparing for war (before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after Iraq it was 5, after the overthrow of Kaddafi 4 remained, but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government).
Whoever attempted to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the Civil War he began to issue his own (that is state-issued) money and was assassinated in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to close the Fed (Federal Reserve), and was killed in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936, after he had intended to sue the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 1929.
Their thirst for global power led in the years of 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a three-world-war plan by the freemason leader of the 33rd degree, Albert Pike.
The first war was to remove the large monarchic state bodies in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule, especially from Great Britain, and the third will reduce the world's population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people (this number of slaves will suffice for their comfort and luxury, and will not use up so many resources), the creation of one universal faith (ecumenism is just an appetiser for this solution), and finally the seizing of absolute power.
The method, which the group of wealthy families with the Rothschilds leading the way, employ is the instigation of crises, followed by the offering of a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
These solutions are false, however, and always lead to a worse situation (vide establishment of the Fed, so that the crisis of 1907 would not be repeated).
Thus, having succeeded in assassinating Ferdinand, the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo thereby unleashing World War I, they destroyed tsarist Russia with the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly, militarily and economically unsubstantiated, with German capitulation (the war was no longer needed to destroy tsarist Russia) and the central European powers of Austria-Hungary were subsequently dismantled.
To facilitate the inception of the Second World War, they allowed bankers and politicians to create a latent conflict situation by saddling Germany with huge war reparations, thereby making a radicalist example of the impoverished masses, it remained only to introduce a sufficiently convincing culprit and a leader with a simple solution, while also creating a multi-racial Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed did, the role of a fifth colony, once the war had been ignited.
At the end of the 19th Century, the Rothschilds instigated the establishment of the Zionist movement, one branch of which strove to form the Jewish State, seeking out an area of historic Judea, Jerusalem, to make its capital (the Return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the leash, which international bankers were holding him on, or whether his actions were all part of the plan, is difficult to determine, nevertheless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the world's acceptance of the Jewish State.
Israel was officially formed in 1948, and just as the war reparations for World War II were layed on Germany, the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war's hotbed.
Provided the international bankers succeed, the Jewish Nation, as with the second, will be the victims on the front line, now together with the Arabic - or more generally, Muslim - population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but on an international level (just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the wrong-doer and who is the victim in the Palestine-Israel conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless cycle of violence, while everything began from the greed of a few and their lust for global power?
Here, we must differentiate between Israel's general population and their leaders, because, just as it happens here, the international bankers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for.
Israel's current prime minister, Netanyahu 'the hawk', is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything to instigate war with Iran, which would, due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, ...) lead to a greater threat of global conflict, and through its control of the Hormuz Strait, where 20% of the world's oil must sail (the channel is only 2 miles wide), to the destruction of the world's economy.
In what light stand the words, spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order."
The New World Order in their eyes is one of master and slave.
A world where the rest of the human population serve the luxury of a handful of financial aristocrats.
A world, where each new-born is implanted with a chip, which makes their existence completely subjugated.
"He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.
If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast,
for it is man's number. His number is six hundred and sixty six."
