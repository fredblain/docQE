With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file exchange.
Around 200,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15,000 computers on the network.
Close to a thousand web sites accept bitcoins as donations or means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, returning today to around a dozen dollars (rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as 'credits', used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, on each occasion, a central authority controls and handles the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does the network operate?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
A set of information associated with this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-key encryption system.
So the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of accounts, broadcast across the entire network.
The key step is entering the new transaction in the book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge issued to the computers, and the winner, a kind of interim central banker, will have the privilege of adding this extra line.
This is a file hashing phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it, then "hash" it all up.
The goal being to find the number that gives a special imprint (lots of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all the other transactions; any modification would alter the imprint.
If a user wanted to defraud by paying twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other would remain an orphan because the two have different imprints.
The computer that resolves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is regularly divided by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible down to the hundred millionth, which leaves some margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has had its ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen.
"The loophole used is not the protocol itself" says Pierre Noizat reassuringly, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also highlights the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
But cash also has this weakness.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analysed the accounting books and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "huge sell-offs" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged" welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless payment by mobile, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper.
Also the user manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement by merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognise" says Pierre Noizat, who confirms he has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to reappraise hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to become firmly established, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, says it will reassess the various risks, currently regarded as high, in the event of the currency's success.
