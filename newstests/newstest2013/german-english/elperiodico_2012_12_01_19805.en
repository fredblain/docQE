What is private offline is private online
Privacy.
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it means the quality of private life or "the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference."
What is privacy for an under 16?
How do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks?
Do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by airing information over the Internet which they probably would not share offline?
ElPeriódico interviewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very much mine" on a personal level, and "in the user name and password" when applied to social networks.
"I wouldn't upload my deepest secrets in a post" says Jorge, aged ten, when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, with which he has had accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, I'll tell my mother, but not everybody" he says.
On FB I upload nice pictures or games.
And I have fun with people I know.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or that belongs to somebody who's doing something stupid" he says.
The child recognises that it is bad to post obscene pictures of naked people, crimes, or write humiliating or aggressive comments.
Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
His mother is included, and she has the password to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and post interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I only upload them" he adds.
"Social networking is fun, I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends" he says.
He does not hesitate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Nor would he take any notice of someone who recommends a stranger to him.
The case of Joseph, aged 14, is different.
This teenager has accounts with Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the last case he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list.
"It doesn't bother me, because we have something in common, like music" he says.
The boy says that no-one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number.
"If they pressured me or asked me for it, I'd just delete them from my account" he states.
Joseph became a follower on Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
This teenager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being pestered on a social network.
They were threatening him and demanding money from him.
"I never found out who it was" he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He just made it private."
He then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
I would do it if I didn't like somebody, or they made me want to do it.
"However, I know that's cyberbullying" he admits.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and teenagers, they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these websites, the rules of the game changed" he says.
Porras says the scholar Marc Prensky, with a Master's degree in Education from Yale University and author of the work Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are those children and young people born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, when we are still in fact learning" he says.
He says that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or divulge, at an age at which maturity is not conducive to this."
"They also have to be selective when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends, without thinking of the consequences" he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is, is through questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it is no good" he adds.
Porras then lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do it online?
Or, would you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When tagging party photos, did you ask the other people's permission to tag them?
And one more question: does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
Another point is to make them see that they must behave online as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Outside the Internet, people act with respect, morality and other principles, so they should act the same way on social networks" he says.
Monitoring
Stuart Guard, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says it is essential for parents to read social networks' policies thoroughly.
By understanding all the clauses, they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account.
"For example, the age at which you are allowed to share or publish" he says.
According to Guardia, it is important to remind children the "don't talk to strangers" lesson.
