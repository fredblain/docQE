NKU Head: Svarc System audit has failed because of politicians.
The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts, but it lags behind in their application.
This was said by Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office (NKU) in an interview for Aktualne.cz.
"The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion," states Kala, commenting on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German auditors.
As an example of improper practice, they cite Petr Necas's approach to the so-called "Svarc System."
The Prime Minister recently claimed that the ODS will not be burdening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed?
"The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohibits something, then even the Government's head cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce," asserts Kala.
At the audit committee's session in the House of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany, within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared.
What exactly was this about?
This is about parallel auditing, which we began around two years ago.
Simply put, this is about how European legislation governs the handling of public contracts, followed by individual state legislations and then the actual practice itself.
We brought all this together, and although the audit is not yet complete, some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms, our legislation might be even "more concise and complete," however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany.
This confirms that creating more and more concise rules is not enough, and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws.
What does this project actually help you with, and what do you think its outcome will bring?
This kind of joint audit could contribute to curtailing these efforts to specify our law, to reduce and perfect boundaries, when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price, so that profiteering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided.
However, just because we have reduced the order limits, does not mean something will be procured.
The system might become overloaded with the amount of paperwork, and those, who wish to look for loopholes in it, will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher.
These are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts.
How does the audit system work in Germany?
Is there an office like the NKU, or is it organised differently?
As far as the office is concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof functions like our NKU, and it is organised like ours, it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently, but basically both offices operate similarly.
Powers are also similar to a degree, though of course Germany is organised federally, so these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly differs from our own.
The BRH can only audit federal money, known to us as state funds.
Public funds, which, for us, are administered by regional and municipal authorities, are audited by the federal courts of auditors there.
When it comes to their legislation, is it more straightforward than ours?
Overall, I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data, nevertheless in certain respects Germany serves as an example, but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect.
Is this because, perhaps, they have better enforcement?
That is certainly not true, but again, I prefer not to make such comparisons.
It should be said that even in a country we perceive as exemplary, they encounter a whole range of problems.
If that were not the case, they would gain nothing from working with our office, would they?
Coming back to domestic legislation, what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office, is its impact being felt already?
The period since the amendment came into force has been quite short, so it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet.
Since we carry out our audits ex-post, a certain delay has to be taken into account.
As yet, we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audits - we have launched our new "fiscal failure risk detection" system, with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts, and these have been analysed - that is where changes will clearly be seen, because of the changed limits, the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes, and so on.
So do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit, or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction, and I hope this will be confirmed.
A problem, which may arise here, is that the law becomes "too constrained" and will not be enforceable.
Under the previous rules, parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes, the regional office) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth constraining the law in this way, in that case?
I do not think this is the way.
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it, but not penalise those, who make a mistake on a technicality, which does not affect the final decision.
This kind of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy.
So how can we get out of this?
Let's see where this dead-end takes us.
The Prime Minister recently said the ODS will not be burdening businessmen with audits of the so-called "Svarc System" - what does this mean?
Is the Svarc System prohibited or allowed?
The Law must be set out one way or the other, and if it prohibits something, then even the Government's head cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce.
He may say: "Let us change this law and relax it," but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there.
The law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the formalities which must be adhered to - which is the right way to ensure public tenders are protected.
On the other hand, it is a tragedy, when a bidder with the best offer is excluded on a technicality.
The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion.
