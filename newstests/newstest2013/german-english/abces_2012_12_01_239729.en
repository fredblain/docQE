"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the "Valentino: Master of Couture," an exhibition that opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other of the Italian designer's famous clients.
Somerset House, former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valentino Garavani exhibition.
During the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Couture," the designer acknowledged a retrospective apotheosis that brings together over 130 couture gowns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace" he says, in his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "signore" Garavani, although it could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until March 3, there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece to Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as if they were trophies of his social ascent from humble couturier in Voghera, northern Italy, to idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't drop cigarette ends on your magnificent carpet, like some beautiful pop music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host whose entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad" says "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife, a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he is a star.

The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also recalls the couturier's charisma.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went for dinner at his flat.
There were twenty of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
You could see and feel his "spirit" in every detail of the flat and its decor, the food and the music.
"All the guests were made to feel important and loved" recalls the top model, who started working with him during Haute Couture Week Paris, in 1995.
"His designs are works of art and so never go out of fashion" she concludes.
Nobility parade 
Garavani's life is not a story of obsession, but of well reciprocated love.
He loves well-educated people who come from good backgrounds, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous, sixty-foot long catwalk which offers a role reversal: visitors take the place of the models and have to parade down the catwalk while looking at a dream "audience" wearing Valentino masterpieces, for example, the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte" and the wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this crowd of mannequins, names stand out such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say your first Valentino is like your first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a "gilet" waistcoat and jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
"It was a gift he gave me" says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to other designers because of his femininity, his great love of women, and because he enhances our beauty" added the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colours he uses, they really stand out and "lend themselves" to your face.
Their proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion advisor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also remembers the first time she wore a Valentino.
As a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of reaching the age when I'd have the chance to wear one of his evening gowns...
My time finally came in the late '90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in the castle belonging to my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress, with a frilly skirt, draped "corsage" and a strapless neckline.
"It was a dream come true" says Princess D'Arenberg, the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless" says this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg looks after her couturier gowns with "the utmost care ... because a dress not just a dress, it's also the many memories that go with it."
The "king" of fashion
The "grand finale" of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months' work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses) to create the pearl-encrusted, ivory-coloured silk gown with twelve different types of lace and a train four and a half metres long.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the leading authority of the specialist press, that dress represents a high fashion milestone of the late 20th century, "the return of high society clients."
Dazzled for years with the "savoir-Ãªtre" of the elite, Valentino is now its finest exponent.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of his clients' husbands.
"I've always been struck by his refined and calm manner, and his neat and perfect appearance" acknowledges D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was on the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was immaculate, time stands still for him."
If a princess says that...
