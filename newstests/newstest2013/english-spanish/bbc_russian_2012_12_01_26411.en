The Ministry of the Interior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circulation
The share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to toughen up the law for owners of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents: CLICK shots at weddings, where there were no casualties, and the massacre staged by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, resulting in CLICK the death of seven people.
Policemen want to prohibit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons licensing from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Safety and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by "tightening the screws."
An open letter appeared online, whose authors - representatives of different social rifle organizations - demand to abandon the "senseless toughening."
The percentage of crime involving registered weapons is minimal, said criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov to BBC Russia.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's statistics, 142 crimes using firearms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012, whereas 1,168,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period.
Authors of the open letter are certain that the toughening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the "black" market.
According to them, one can find any weapon at a low price right now.
Nonetheless, the Ministry of the Interior asserts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
The "black" market of weapons is replenished through several channels.
There are five such channels, explains retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for 10 years.

First: "army or military loot," i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Caucasians," says Baranets.
Next are "black weapons," stolen by criminals from representatives of defence agencies.
Baranets explains that this covers weapons taken from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement agencies' employees.
Illegal arms are taken to be sold from military warehouses.
Explosions have often been heard at military warehouses.
"There are proven theories that some of the fires were intentional, in order to cover the shortage," says the former military man.
Manufacturers of weapons make their contribution, according to Baranets.
"There are so many private weapons factories now, which do not endure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market, including in Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is trafficking.
An especially high number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There's production there, sometimes handmade; and a mafia has formed, which has organized a stream," explains the former military man.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts counted the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
A report about this was prepared by the Centre of Problems Analysis and Public Management Planning in 2011.
Experts analysed the reports of the Department of the Interior and Rosstat, criminology literature and open data from portals on weapons.
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, comes from the military and security forces.
Half of all arms on the black market are there "because of officials, whose work is connected with weapons," states the report.
According to researchers' data, 17% of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas, 14% is theft during production, 5% is "black archaeology."
A sales consultant of one of the weapons stores, who wished to remain anonymous, asserts that the weapons found by "black" diggers are not being bought any more, because they're too old.
According to him, dealers go to the military warehouse for a new batch of goods.
One piece, for example a TT gun can be bought from a warrant officer.
It is issued to him, and given through the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines," he says.
"The truth is that police are aware of everything, that is why periodically, when the crime detection rate is low, it conducts test purchases from illegal weapons merchants," says the consultant.
"Like in a luxury store"
The buyer and seller often find each other through friends.
I looked at sites, blogs, till someone responded, offering me to go to Begovaya station, where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the "corner" so we can negotiate.
I found out the price of the weapon only there
military commentator Viktor Baranets
To get a weapon, I need someone with connections, says the sales consultant. - I have an acquaintance, but I'm not sure it's reliable.
There are salesmen on labour markets, but one needs to "come" there conditionally "from John Doe, who asked to tell that his daughter lost a tooth."
Right now, even if I need a few knuckledusters, I get them through someone I trust.
He also supplies them only to me, because he knows that I won't give him away.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990's, when he was preparing to publish an article about this.
The formulas are still the same, according to him.
He was given an album of pictures with "anything and everything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," he recalls.
According to Baranets, the buyer is not offered a pig in a poke - you can try out everything.
I, the potential client, am not just buying; we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there.
"I am given the opportunity to shoot, and when I am certain that the weapon is good, we begin to negotiate," describes the expert.
Store on a sofa
Internet searches lead to sites and "Vkontakte" groups, where weapons "for different purposes" are on offer.
No documents or personal meetings are needed.
"It's enough to have a certain sum of money," says the advertisement heading on the website "Buy a pistol or rifle."
Users leave their requests and ask questions.
Can a minor buy?
"Without a license, of course," asks user "John" (name is changed).
"Want to buy a TT, Moscow," concisely requests "Fedorenkov."
Federal Security Service now spread a big network of fake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons.
People come like hungry fish to bait, and then mine coal in Siberia.

I heard about this: normally the site is registered outside the area of applicability of the laws of Russia.
People accept orders.
The buyer pays at an ATM.
"In response, a photo is sent with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," says Press Secretary of the Rights to Weapons non-governmental organization Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranets confirms that after leaving a request on the site you can stay without a weapon and go to jail.

Makarov for 100 dollars
When buying illegal firearms, 100 to 900 dollars is enough according to experts.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the Rights to Weapons organization, a Makarov gun can be acquired for 100-300 dollars.
The wait time is a month to a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the mid-level management of these warehouses.
According to official statistics of the authorities, the number of such crimes in Russia on the whole dropped 7% as compared to January-October 2011, amounting to 22,900, while the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and explosive devices dropped by 7.8%.
