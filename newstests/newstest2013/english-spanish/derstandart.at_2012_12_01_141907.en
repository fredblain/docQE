The MVRDV architects prove that true adventures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently erected Bücherberg (literally "book mountain") - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, looks futuristic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at," said Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by at the road-side.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a major firm based nearby commented: "It's definitely a thing of beauty, the building."
However, I do wonder why people would need another library in this day and age.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and eBooks.
No-one goes into one of these old-style libraries voluntarily nowadays, or am I wrong?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy town outside the gates of Rotterdam, which barely merits a visit, is a special record-holder.
The 80,000-resident municipality has the lowest literacy rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this asinine situation, the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty, painted reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam-based architectural firm MVRDV, master of audacious bar charts and producer of humorous and often cynical buildings, took the project on with his customary composure, and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And with the judging panel still looking at him with bewilderment, shrugging their shoulders, the impertinent Maas stacked his chosen props by order of size to form a pyramid and rounded off his presentation - now suitably backed up with action - with the words: "Dear Municipality!"
So this is my suggestion for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain - for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain has been lifted up.
It is part of a revitalisation project, which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and terraced houses, with a total of 50 dwellings.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded second place in the "Best Library of NL 2012" competition.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small-town retort, that until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunningly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would expect to find a dairy plant, has been bolstered by a piece of contemporary architecture.
First and foremost, however, Spijkenisse now has its first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long journey to the book
The first impression: the Eldorado of books beneath a cheese dome.
There is in fact a lift that climbs through the centre of the mountain massif, however, the true joys of space and literature are revealed when scaling the topography on foot.
The interior space, glazed throughout, is bright and open, the fired clinker floors and the elegant street lamps speak the unmistakable language of a public town square.
The urban ambiance is perfect.
You are already on the lookout for a park bench, a dog, and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere there are books, books, books.
"Normally book shelves run along the facade, and in the centre there is a large, dark space, which is usually unpleasant and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classical spatial configuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: in the centre there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental centre and the central technical support room.
One particularly special feature are the black book shelves, which simultaneously act as wall cladding, parapets and railings for the stairway.
The appearance, feel and scent are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown construction materials.
"Here we wanted to work with recyclable materials," explained Joop Trouborst, Project Manager for the Municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the Standard.
And thus one day we stumbled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture, on a Frisian farm.
For many years, millimetre-thick artificial fabric has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a base layer.
It is inexpensive and saves time.
The thin textile lasts for two seasons and is then disposed of as bulk waste.
For the library, the fabric was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four-centimetre-thick boards.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouw plastic (KLP) changes colour to a dark, homogeneous and robust material, that smells like a mixture of new car smell and the smell of trainers.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the 500-meter-long journey, you are rewarded in the Literature Café, not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
These provide atmosphere, but most importantly, regulate the air humidity in the literary mountain range.
Donations for the new soul
"You would hardly believe it, but this building, in spite of the many glass panels, is a showcase project in the area of ecology," said Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled using geothermal heat.
Although the Bücherberg has a glass cover, the sun only shines only briefly into the interior, even on sunny days.
The broad, laminated wood glue beams positioned at right-angles to the glass facade, provide shade and absorb the majority of the sunlight.
The indoor temperature is very pleasant.
The rest is taken care of by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, initially a sceptic of the IT sector, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig has also visited already.
So too has TCM-teacher, Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul."
The reason: At the inauguration just a few weeks ago, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his/her personal collection.
This was, for the time being, to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently there are 70,000 items.
The concept has been a success.
The shelves are full to capacity.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," said architect Winy Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain bond with this new building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of the building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
As such, MVRDV have succeeded in mastering the master discipline that specialist jargon refers to as the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
However young and uneducated it may be.
This is ultimately a starting point for identity.
