Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
In the vote on the incorporation of Palestine, Germany abstained from voting.
According to Stephen Szabo, Expert in US-European relations, in so doing Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the Palestinians' application for observer status within the United Nations.
However, Berlin subsequently abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, due to their special relationship with Israel, Germany must be cautious.
At the same time, however, I do not believe that it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - albeit without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany likewise abstained from voting, when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was ultimately implemented by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs?
Yes, it does.
That is because it has just reorganised its foreign policy, indeed moving away from a policy that was, so to speak, managed by the USA, in favour of a German foreign policy.
This situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standardised policy.
The Germans thus find themselves caught between two fronts.
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, yet this is something that they are not accustomed to.
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role, but they are en route to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of France, or Great Britain.
So what specifically does a "normal" foreign policy entail, from a German perspective?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters, which are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, that is, by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia, China or the Near East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Near East conflict and their voting in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East, and particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore it must be careful not to affront the public, but also the elite in the Arabic countries.
In any case, this plays a role.
However, I wouldn't want to ascribe too much weight to this. This is not an entirely one-sided relationship.
Nonetheless, it does play an important role in Germany's considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA, by abstaining to vote on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the USA, a great understanding for the German position prevails.
Therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fracture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya.
Perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respect.
After all, it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered.
In Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative.
The USA, on the other hand, have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nations?
Due to the American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think that secretly, the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation.
However, due to the political situation here, the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly.
It is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is really not quite so enthused by Netanjahu's policies.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand, and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that this is precisely what makes things so difficult for the Germans.
It would of course be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and standardised European policy, which is currently not the case.
Thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position.
This is precisely what they are doing with the Euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in urging Europe towards a standardised European position.
This is, of course, no simple task for Germany, on account of its relations with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
Yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role?
Or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, the country continues to be uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role.
If we look at the Euro crisis for example, every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role, various anti-German feelings become apparent.
This does not make matters simple for the Germans.
This is actually the same old problem: one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this stance, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions, and this is not easy.
The influence of the USA over European politics is continually diminishing, yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacuum, so who is filling the gap?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it, even if it is uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
