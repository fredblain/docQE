Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth (Texas), became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "JR," in the television series "Dallas," in which he played a ruthless, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon predator JR Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as JR in a new season of "Dallas," died on Friday afternoon of cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to the Associated Press by the Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again representing the iconic role he most liked" the family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him dearly.
"He was an original guy and lived life to the full" said Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years.
In 1995 a malignant tumour as found in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
He played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive genie, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live with him.
He also starred in two sitcoms that were not aired for long, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included roles well received by critics in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of delightfully detestable JR that led to Hagman reaching his peak of stardom.
The drama series on CBS about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The tagline "Who shot JR?," designed to generate hype around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars wagered in gaming establishments.
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment programme in history, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was JR's sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
JR got her pregnant then threatened to say she was a prostitute unless she left town, but there were others who also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as a corrupt insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and cheating husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), sectioned.
"I know what I want on JR's tombstone" Hagman said in 1988.
It should read: "Here lies the honest citizen JR Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off screen."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for TNT.
He had already finished recording five episodes for the second series and a sixth was in process, the chain reported.
Immediately after, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would handle the loss of Hagman.
Hagman, born in Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck in the New York theatre scene in the early '50s, and later served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956, in England.
While there, he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two sons, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales About My Life."
"I didn't put anything in it that I believed would hurt anyone or affect them in any way" he told Associated Press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an organ donation promoter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital, helping fearful patients.
"I advise them, encourage them, meet with them when they come for their surgery, and afterwards" he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, such as "Don't be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but then you'll be fine."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and took part in several campaigns.
