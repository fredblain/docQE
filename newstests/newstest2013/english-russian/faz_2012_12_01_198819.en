"Brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren likewise.
However, what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name hides a fully officially registered brand in China, however, one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies.
Nonetheless, it is enjoying protection, provided the actual creators of the names do not sue.
And even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights.
"It is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," said Thomas Pattloch, lawyer within the Taylor Wessing law firm, who specialises in copyright infringement in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
All the copycats require are a few additional letters in order that they can register their brands.
Thus Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, Prada-Kny is registered in place of Prada.
German companies are also 'legally' copied in this manner, such as manufacturer of sporting apparel, Puma.
Pattloch opens a file containing registrations with the trademark office in Peking.
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company copyrighted the brand name Zegna DF Puma there, an alias that also helps itself to the name of fashion retailer Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property is well-known.
In the major cities there are multi-level department stores that sell counterfeit goods almost exclusively.
Pattloch's cases, however, are slightly different: on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office, fully officially, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai," a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
This refers to women who latch onto rich men.
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing.
"This harms business and we must fight against it," challenges Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, its uniqueness disappears - the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and process costs of the affected branches amount into the millions, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to information from market research company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros annually, China is the third largest market for luxury items, and the fastest growing.
However, the deletion of dubious entries in the trademark registry are difficult to achieve, and cost a pretty penny.
The process can last for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of instances whereby the court dismisses cases, because after a long period of time, the name to which the objection is being raised has become a "market reality."
If the complainant is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money for having infringed on his trademark in China, said Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Even today, the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo-purchaser Geely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled the BMW logo; the dispute was arbitrated and Geely was forced to change it.
Fashion house Lacoste lost a suit in China against copycats from Hong Kong and Singapore, who were using the famous crocodile looking in the other direction. 
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing.
The CTMO trademark office in Peking does acknowledge that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to limited staffing and equipment.
In the past year, however, things reportedly "returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow."
Thus the stock of unprocessed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cased were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nonetheless, there are still 81,500 appeals waiting to be resolved in the office.
To remedy this is very expensive
As is so often the case in China, the figures are imposing.
In the past year, more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the CTMO, almost one third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China, for the tenth time in succession, is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications, informed the authority.
The same applies for the inventory of valid trademarks, totalling 5.5 million in number.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were received.
Put simply, this means that each application costs on average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
To appeal against an application costs many times this amount, as can be seen in the case of the German family business, Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been contesting against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans did in fact manage to expose the company's illegal manufacturing of copied motor vehicle parts.
However, the copycat still secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
This is something we missed ourselves, as family names cannot be protected in Germany, said Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Management at Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office then also dismissed the Munich-based company's appeal.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was proven right, however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day.
You have to pay extremely careful attention.
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves." 
The internal costs can barely be calculated, the company archive even had to look through century-old records in order to provide proof.
Five years ago Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "high six-figure sum in euros" as settlement.
"This shows how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to spilling over, back into Europe.
Particularly if imitators secure unprotected brand names there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany.
This is a business sector that the group had long vacated, yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration.
"You have to pay extremely careful attention," says Wentzler.
Both he and Pattloch advise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, rather foreigners should also register "everything" that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well," said Wentzler.
Otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the registration fee.
In actual fact: if Freudenberg were to loose at the final hurdle of its trademark drama, they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name, explained Wentzler.
Or alternatively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector.
