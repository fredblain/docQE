Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case 
Gaspar Llamazares, the general coordinator of IU and member of the party Izquierda Unida, confirmed today that the decision for the case concerning the councillor for Youth and Sport of the city of Siviglia, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after the accusation of cronyism. The case will be up to the regional federation for training. 
"I'm very federalist when considering this kind of issues, and the Andalusian organization needs to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the resolution the party should adopt with the man who was an alderman in Siviglian board until now. 
Moreover, the leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding whatever irregularity Silva had committed, "The UI always wanted these kind of investigations to have the maximum transparency." 
Similarly, he stressed that training goes under "very strict codes of ethics for all public functions."
