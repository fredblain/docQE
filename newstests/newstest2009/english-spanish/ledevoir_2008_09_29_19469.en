The interview - Blood becomes safe again 
Héma-Québec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient suppliers of blood in the world. 
And most importantly, it has regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As we know, national reserves managed by the blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross had been infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C during the 1980s. 
Faced with this tragedy and public discontent, the Government of Canada established in February 1994 a public inquiry, headed by Justice Horace Krever, which aimed at shedding light on the circumstances which led to such a tragedy and making recommendations so that such a disaster never happens again. 
While Judge Krever delayed in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau has fulfilled that mandate. 
In the wake of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and Canadian Blood Supply for all other provinces and the two territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began operations, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
By dint of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and field work during the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public", she says before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Héma-Québec. 
Dr. Décary, nonetheless, thinks "confidence is something extremely fragile". 
From its inception on the 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle. 
At that time, there were in Europe with the outbreak of a number of cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, said he who has been holding the fort since its founding in 1998. 
"And we did not know at all if the disease could be transmitted through blood. 
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports according to which when we are uncertain and when a serious illness may result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, one establishes an excluding action. 
In April 1999, the blood of people who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused. 
But a few years ago, it was demonstrated beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
This episode has shown that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense." 
In 1999, on the market a technique appeared which was much more sensitive for HIV testing: the nucleic acid testing (NAT) allowed to detect directly in donated blood the virus itself rather than antibodies against the virus, which is what previous tests were based on. 
The TAN helped to shorten the silent period, which runs between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains. 
It was able to reduce that period to less than a week. 
Thus, it has substantially reduced the risk that some donors were infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them. 
These improvements have helped reduce the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion. 
Today, a person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV contaminated blood. 
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will be distributed before someone is infected with HIV. 
Since Héma-Quebec each year distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs. 
I believe that now we can feel at ease when receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recuperate our health", affirmed the CEO of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
One never knows what disease will emerge in the system. 
As recently as last year, there appeared on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
We must be constantly vigilant, "continues Dr. Décary before emphasizing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide them in sufficient quantities. 
"The demand is increasing as the population ages. 
The treatments being more aggressive, patients often need to refill in red blood cells or platelets. 
The aging population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which includes an average of only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate blood." 
Any healthy person, aged 18 and over fits the suitability criteria to give blood every 56 days, six times a year. 
On average, 14% of those offering their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled in a country where malaria is rife, they would be excluded for a period of one year. 
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals. 
The shortages are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and cannot donate their blood. 
It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but even more so to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors. 
Life today runs so fast, there is rarely time to find an hour to donate one's blood", says Francine Décary miserably. 
With an annual budget of $ 297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns. 
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which manages also the only bank of placental blood in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that was once regarded as biomedical waste is full of a rich blood stem cells which can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia. 
" A few weeks ago, we celebrated the banking of the thousandth sample of placental cord blood and we expect to draw more than a thousand per year. 
We should start to propose transplants at the beginning of next year, "says Dr. Décary describing this program for collecting placental cord blood as very popular. 
"Many mothers are disappointed at not being able to access it" because Héma-Québec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
