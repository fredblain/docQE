Listen to the four renderings of the new version of the Czech national anthem. 
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my Country) on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood. 
The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theater Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek. 
Four versions are available - versions with male or female solo vocals, a choral version and an instrumental version. 
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka did the singing. 
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček. 
You can listen to all four versions on the server iHNed.cz. 
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful national anthems. 
He told Czech Radio earlier that he had intentionally selected singers with young, representative voices that were striking and popular for the solo variants. 
"From the beginning, with both of them and also with the chorus, I tried to make sure that they had clear articulation, so that the text could be understood well, so that they were in harmony," he said. 
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year. 
The song Kde domov můj (Where is my Country) was heard for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Estates Theater in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl with the music of František Škroup. 
It gained popularity and the people spontaneously took it as their own. 
The first stanza of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem following the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918. 
It remained one of the seven state symbols even following the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
