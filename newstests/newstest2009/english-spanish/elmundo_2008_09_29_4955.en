The best fashion award 
Probably there is not a more appropriate place in the world than Paris to present a fashion award, and probably there is not a living designer as exquisite as Valentino. 
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to support the international promotion of new talents in the fashion field. 
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros. 
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in the Mango's window at the number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann – Paris, and was almost crying for emotion. 
Moreover, the company's store is the second largest in Europe, recently opened on 1335 square meters' space. 
The most important one is located in London. 
The numerous events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who chaired the jury of the contest, brought us to a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris. 
The proximity of the most exquisite paintings by Chagal made the presidential gala table prepared by Mango even more spectacular. 
Nati, with a broken heart and making a virtue of necessity, because of the recent death of her brother, wore a dress of the company and fashion complements by ELAH that took your breath away. So, arm in arm with her son Luis - a two meters height boy - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner she had organized. 
Andik, owner and master of Mango, welcomed the guests and as the gentleman he is, along with Baron Rotchil arrived at the end of the night without his jacket, because both had granted it to two ladies. 
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and shirt - designed by herself – changed her dress for the dinner, wearing a very sensual long black dress. She got very excited when, during the night walk inside the opera house, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the room for dance recitals, and recalling other times, she grabbed a bar and outlined a "grand plie". 
Inés Sastre did not join the walk inside the building, but before leaving, showed us her son's photos on her mobile phone. 
Next morning we welcomed the presence of Olivier Martinez - another boy who likes moving by motorbike - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel of Paris, bringing his own sheets, towels and only after asking to have no smells in his room. 
Stars under the starlit Paris sky. 
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
