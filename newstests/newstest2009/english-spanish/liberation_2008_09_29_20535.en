In Minsk, "have you noticed that there was an election, have you?" 
Young people and other opponents demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the outcome of legislation. 
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening at the closing of polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent elections. 
While no results have as yet been announced, many young people came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation." 
Some confess to not having even voted: "What for, since they will do whatever they want of my voice," said a youth. 
They do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression with foreign observers in order to resume discussions with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn. 
The sanctions, which include visa bans for 40 Belarusian officials and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if the elections are seen as appropriate by the observers. 
They have not been according to the opposition. 
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the count," lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties. 
"It's a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because it's who counts the votes that is important, and here, that is the executive power. 
If opposition members enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected. 
But their entry into parliament could mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and proposed laws." 
The opposition should therefore enter the political game because "we must open a dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy which is heavily in debt with Russia, enters into a crisis, and if we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
We want to be independent". 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the electoral process, does not recognize the validity of the ballot. 
She stressed that the participation figures seem too high, and that the spread in voter turnout (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the vote to all sorts of manipulations. 
"Have you noticed that there was an election, have you? Queries the Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of two political prisoners released in August this year. 
There was nobody at the voting offices. 
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in parliament, those who are most convenient to those in power." 
The silence of the night falls on October Square. 
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Committee welcomed their success.
