Both Barack Obama and McCain support the bank rescue package 
Both Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates of the two main American parties, confirmed on Sunday to back the government's 700 billion dollar bank rescue package, though there are politicians calling for the treasury secretary to resign. 
After several days of marathon negotiations, the congressional and government representatives announced at Sunday dawn: they have reached an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package. 
Wall Street crisis and the financial package aiming to render the frozen credit market have become central issues of the presidential campaign. 
Both Obama and McCain seem to act in a way to prove: he is more suitable than his competitor to lead the country out of the economic crisis. 
According to the latest surveys, due to the economic issues which have come into the foreground, Obama has gained some advantage again, while McCain's leading position - that he had acquired after the Republican convention, by having appointed Sarah Palin as vice-president - has now melted. 
Obama expressed his hope at a campaign gathering in Detroit regarding the fast congressional approval of the act on the 700 billion dollar package. 
He emphasized that the proposal included those consumer protection passages that he had supported, too. 
"We must act now, with responsibility (...) people's jobs, their savings, entire industries, the stabilization of the whole economy are the things that are threatened", he added in front of a crowd of 35 000 people. 
He did not miss the chance to describe McCain's economic concepts as outdated. 
McCain stated in his report given to ABC that "this is a situation that will take long for all of us to digest (...) but doing nothing is just cannot be afforded". 
The Republican senator declared that the proposal included the need to set up a committee supervising the treasury secretary and to restrict the severance of top leaders, it was him who had insisted on these issues. 
Obama said to CBS that McCain had played no essential role in the reconciliations, while he had been in daily contact with the secretary. 
Nancy Pelosi, chairwoman of the House of Representatives provided the information that the House of Representatives was expected to vote on the bill on Monday.
