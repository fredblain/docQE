Stepfather abuse "led to suicide" 
Years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself, a court has been told. 
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault. 
Truro Crown Court heard he regularly tied up his step-daughter Stephanie Randle, when she was aged between five and seven. 
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for her death." 
The court heard that Ms Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, aged 34. 
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and blindfolded her before performing sexual acts, while her mother was out working at a pub. 
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall. 
His step-daughter went to Plymouth. 
But the court heard that Ms Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the abuse which had been inflicted on her twice-weekly. 
By 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court, friends said Ms Randle, who had been a keen surfer and cyclist, was "emotionally dead", and had "given up on life". 
In April 2007 her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead at her flat in Plymouth. 
She is thought to have killed herself through suffocation using a plastic bag. 
Mr Randle confronted his daughter's step-father, who wrote a confession letter which ended: "I used to tie her up and blindfold her. 
"I didn't sexually assault her. 
I feel responsible for her death." 
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven. 
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking her own life. 
Even more stark, is the fact that had she not done so, it's very doubtful that matters would have ended up in court." 
He added: "I note the effect Stephanie's father and mother describe your crime having on their daughter over the years. 
"She was plainly otherwise likely to have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
