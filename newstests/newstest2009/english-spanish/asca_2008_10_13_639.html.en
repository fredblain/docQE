UNIPOL: ROME TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS AT GROTTAFERRATA 
The president of the second penal section of the Rome tribunal, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the petition made by the estate agent, Danilo Coppola that had requested to be able to move from his home town, Grottaferrata, to an abode in Rome. 
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy within the scope of the inquiry on the counter-proposal regarding the Unipol-Bnl takeover. 
While on trial, last week, he obtained the release from house arrest transformed into an obligation to remain resident in Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the estate agent could travel from the country town within the province to an abode within the capital. 
According to the tribunal, however, these trips (against which the PM has advised)would allow him to influence his company and to have access to the evidence that is used to charge him.
