Superglue to be able to walk on walls 
To defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future be able to walk up walls like Spiderman. 
It's the aim of various American research centres and now a team of four institutes has come very close. 
With an adhesive of only 2.5 cm squared the scientists have succeeded in gluing a body of 100 kilograms onto a vertical wall. 
Studying – The American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and of the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material invented by the team of scientists is an improvement on existent materials that utilise a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes. 
«The principle behind the glue could be imagined as being like a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists were inspired by the paws of geckoes, covered with microscopic bristles which succeed in assuring a perfect adhesion to the animal. 
The tests conducted on various materials such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the paws of this reptile and at the same time"comes off from walls easier» explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Engineering Faculty of the University of Dayton. 
WALK ON WALLS? -"This material could be useful as a temporary glue» adds Liming Dai. 
Perhaps for walking on walls just like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but the researchers are thinking of a less glamorous use such as the connections between electrical devices, because the carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and of electrical current. 
Other applications could be within the aerospace industry. 
For now, no superheroes. 
OTHER RESEARCH – Even Berkeley University, in California, is dedicating itself to the research of a new adhesive. 
In an article in the journal of the  American Chemical Society the Californian scientists have presented an adhesive composed of microfibers like hair that self-clean from the dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
