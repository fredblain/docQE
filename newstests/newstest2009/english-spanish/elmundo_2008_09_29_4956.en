"I want to be a young mother, doesn't matter the candidate" 
The great resemblance with her sister has not prevented her from developing a strong personality. 
Monica Cruz is a tiny woman, but still, full of vitality. 
Currently, both the Cruz sisters have taken very seriously their new activity in the fashion field. 
According to Monica, it is much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their names. 
She went to Paris for the campaign Mango is hanging on to promote the new branch, and the presentation of the most important prizes for fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house. 
Warm and timid, she conquers you quite quickly. 
Tell us what you're doing in Paris. 
I came here to present the new collection my sister Penelope and I have designed for the new Mango autumn-winter season, to join the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentino. 
Let's say, a very intense day but a very exciting one, at the same time. 
What is the inspiration of your new collection for Mango in this fourth season of work for the Spanish fashion house? 
Both my sister that I like the cinema of the 50s and 60s. From there we get bigger inspirations. 
Then, I like to get lost in the city and look at how women dress, at the way they combine and mix their clothes. I do it quite frequently. 
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you? 
I think so, although at the very end, all merged and many elements remain cross-field ideas. 
I liked clothes since I was a child. I loved to visit my grandmother to rummage in my aunt's cupboards and discover her clothes. 
It was so good!, much better than going to the amusement park. 
Then, once a dancer, I always took great care of my dressing. 
It is known dancers really like to have their own style when going to class and dance recitals, to look themselves in the mirror and feel good. 
And in the actress role, when you are delivered the wardrobe, this is the time you actually encounter the character. 
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionals. 
Not long ago, you celebrated your 30 years, did you entered a crisis? 
Absolutely I didn't. 
I've never felt better, I like to be 30 years old. 
I find it is the age when women are mature enough and can take advantage of a good experience to enjoy life and commit fewer errors. 
I'm not scared by the biological clock. 
Since I was a child, I did all the things I liked to do and this gave me a great inner happiness. 
So, are you thinking of being mother or not? 
Yes, of course, I'm. I know it is my same body pushing me for this and also I want to be a young mom, I'm not gonna miss it. 
And about the candidate… Does not matter that much. 
I will give my son a lot of happiness and I will educate him with bigger love. 
Talking about cinema, you are waiting the release of some films you acted last year. 
That is, and I'm really curious about that. 
Coming from the theatrical experience, I am a very impatient and anxious woman, I want everything now and clearly, but I know this may not be always possible. 
I'm looking forward mainly for "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo". 
Let's see if you like it... 
Few days ago you debuted on the catwalk side by side with Naomi Campbell, didn't you? 
Well, don't put it this way. 
It's not I was on the catwalk as a professional model. 
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I know since a long time, called and invited me to go to London and attend a charity fashion show for her organization "Women for a Better World". The clothes presented during the show - I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango - have been sold at auction to raise funds for this Naomi's NGO. 
People usually ignore this Naomi's tender heart. 
It is said so many things on her, that, knowing her quite well, I can assure you are not true. 
Moreover, I like to share and get involved in this good part of hers. 
She asked me to be shown for a noble cause, but if I had asked to play a pine, I would do it anyway. 
You cannot back out of helping the third world women.
