Razor's edge battle: MP3 players vs. cell phones. 
Our advice on how to choose 
While nearly every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls. 
This makes it seem clear that it is better to only buy a phone. 
In spite of this, there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player. 
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and demands of the future owner. 
It is not likely that you will get a top-of-the-line expensive record player in order to listen to the newest album by Maxim Turbulenc. 
First of all such music products not available on LPs, but also, from the qualitative point of view there no objective reason for it. 
However, if your shelves are crowded with art rock, jazz, or blues vinyl records, you are likely at least dreaming of a record player like that. 
It's the same with music on trips, that is, compressed music, simply put, MP3 music. 
There are price and qualitative categories here as well. 
For some, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on an MP3 player, just as it is hard for Pink Floyd fan to accept twenty-crown headphones from a market hall. 
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone. 
The selection is broad. 
Battery life also decides 
Some top-of-the-line music players can do much more than merely play music, but also what most cell phones can't even do by chance. 
No contemporary machine is as universal as the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, contains a camera which is sometimes better and sometimes worse and can even navigate in some cases. 
And when we take smart phones and communication devices, you have a small computer in your pocket. 
It's a small miracle, as there is no refrigerator that knows how to grill and no television can take pictures. 
The universal nature of the cell phone also brings disadvantages. 
The more functions you use on your cell phone, the sooner the indicator on your display will send you running for the charger. 
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers. 
Very few cell phones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours, most of them much less. 
In this way, music players (particularly the simplest ones) are much more efficient. 
Which is why you should count on the fact that inexpensive cell phones will not play for more than a few hours. 
If you occasionally make calls in addition to that, to be on the safe side, get another charger for your workplace - even for more expensive devices. 
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even worse ones last at least 9 straight hours running on one charge. 
Another problem arises when recording music on the cell phone. 
Unfortunately, only a limited percentage of the devices contain a universal USB connector, and on top of that, not every one of those can be directly connected to a computer without special software. 
Of course, music can be recorded directly onto a memory card, but very few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in the cell phones without an adaptor. 
For the music players, with some exceptions (iPod), you don't need any special software. 
It's enough to fill the device with music using the USB from the computer. 
Most cell phones and music players already create a music library by themselves, organized according to the artist's name, album title, genre, or, e.g., user rating. 
Some devices only display the tree structure of the directory, similar to Windows Explorer and some are able to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an operating systems). 
Music players easier to service, cell phones can do more 
In choosing specific equipment, you should be interested above all in the life of the battery, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of the audio output, and of course also the user-friendly nature of the operation. 
If music is above all a background setting for you and if you are only going to listen to it for a little while, perhaps in the tram, any cell phone which plays MP3 is enough. 
Which almost any cell phone is truly able to do. 
You don't even have to pay too much attention to which music formats the cell phone or music player can handle. 
The MP3 can handle all of them, and in fact, most of the music you will get will be in this very format. 
It one of the most widespread formats and in addition to it, the absolute majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format. 
Less common is the appearance of AAC (the format used by the Apple company and its iPods). 
Better cell phones, at the same time, enable the purchase of music on-line. 
All you have to do to buy a song or album is visit the pages of the given operator (or another provider) using mobile Internet. 
This service by itself could be a substantial reason for obtaining a music cell phone. 
Unfortunately the offerings from the operators are paltry and are usually limited to fast-growing radio hits. 
The prices are also not among the lowest. 
It is generally assumed, however, that this very manner of music sales (whether using GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will take over the music industry in the future. 
Most people have their cell phone on them at all times. 
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you can reach for your cell phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies at home, forgotten. 
However, it still depends on whether you always have headphones or at least the wire hands-free with you. 
If not, you can utilize the integrated speaker that is in almost all cell phones, but only in a minimum of MP3 players. 
But the greatest advantage of the music cell phones for many people is the price. 
The least expensive of them regularly cost less than three thousand crowns. 
For three or four thousand crowns, you can get a very decent walkman. 
Usually, however, you'll be limited by the absence of output on ordinary headphones. 
The best and most technically well-equipped telephones, with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand crowns. 
The advantage of the music players, on the other hand, is, among other reasons, that they are easy to operate. 
Anyone can handle the operation of the simplest - not necessarily the most inexpensive (see our selection) - music players. 
The minimum of functions and similarity in operation to the formerly common cassette recorder or even the record player is apparent. 
There is no threat of a clash in the form of mobile Internet turned on by accident and the resulting enormous bill for data transmission. 
What device to reach for 
Even the least expensive cell phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have a slot for replaceable memory cards (of the type M2, microSD and the like). 
Even with the additional purchase of the respective card, you will spend less than two thousand crowns. 
Be careful, however. 
With the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB tend to be supported. 
Only the most expensive ones can also handle 8 GB memory cards. 
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
Based on capacity (maximum 2 GB) you don't have to spend more than 1,100 crowns. 
If you are a more demanding listener, reach instead for specialized cell phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung models). 
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the user-friendly nature of their operation is close to that of a separate MP3 player. 
Sony Ericsson, whose cell phones from the walkman series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately, is the most advanced in the field. 
The MP3 players from the brands mentioned above deliver the same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery endurance (normally 15 hours, maximally up to 35 hours).
