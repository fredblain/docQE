Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso, cities cancel historical theatres 
Historical cinematographic theatres close in favour of Multiplex. 
"A city without cinematographic theatres is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes". 
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore efficaciously photographs what is happening not only in the large Italian urban centres but also in provincial towns. 
The sidelining process of the cinemas, with the birth in the outskirts of large multi-hall theatres and the consequent death by consumption of the single-hall theatres within the central areas of the city, is one of those events that appears unavoidable and incontrovertible and also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime. 
Frequently, it is historical places which are full of memories that disappear,"it is as if a friend is lost, an acquaintance with whom we have shared the way and many memories», observes the director of New Cinema Paradise, the film that twenty years ago gave Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prize of the jury of Cannes, and which narrated the poem of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the cinema which, perhaps, has been lost forever. 
The numbers provided by Anec, the main cinema-operators association, speak clearly: within the last five years 316 traditional style cinemas have closed shop, and the ones to pay the price were above all the theatres in the principal cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna, and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions most badly hit by the closures, Emilia-Romagna takes the lead with 82 single-hall cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44), and by Lombardy (41). 
And to demonstrate that the arrival of the multiplex is the most responsible for their disappearance, these are exactly the three Italian regions with the largest number of new multiplex cinemas registered: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. 
«The Italian business has developed in an irrational way» observes Paolo Protti, Anec's president,"it's useful that new structures are built but it's also essential that the survival of existing ones is guaranteed, because once a theatre in a city closes, not all its patrons may be inclined to transfer to the multiplexes. 
Not to mention the missed allocation of funds in favour of operators: the previous debit by the state is of approximately 10 million Euro. 
It's disgraceful, from the ethical and from the moral point of view, that the government does not respect the existent laws. 
To sustain the sector between 16 and 18 million Euro a year are required». 
An interesting example is that of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned by the closures, has decided to take cover by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-hall cinemas both in the historical centre as well as on the outskirts. 
Among the foreseen provisions there are tax relief measures in favour of operators and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: the spectators can enter in the traffic-limited zone and have special tariffs for road parking and in some car parks. 
«It's an initiative which I like» observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and hopes that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in action other measures. 
It's certain though, that to contrast the excessive power of the multiplex, traditional theatres have also to improve the sound and image quality, because the public nowadays is more demanding. 
The defence of traditional cinemas is a theme that for me has always been important: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my infancy and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to create "New Cinema Paradiso", on which I have already been thinking for the last 10 years. 
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinal in National Street both closed by now, there where I have experienced many shared emotions, I turn away so as not to see the posters blackened by the dust».
