Drivers reticent of alcoholism should install the 'alcolock' 
The Interior Office wants the driver under three administrative penalties for excessive alcoholic rate, to install in their car a system that prevents driving the vehicle when drunk. The same if you do not blow into the measuring device. 
The measure was announced last June and has been already included in the Annual Report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a pilot project for a period of one year. 
This project's goal is the reinstatement of the driver, since he will need to attend a course of road re-education. 
The initiative is supported by the Attorney General for Road Safety, together with the General Directorate of Traffic(DGT) and the Technological Institute Foundation for Security in the Automobile(FITS). 
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers fined more than once for drunk driving, still drive a car. 
The 'alcolock' would avoid this, because the device, connected to the vehicle, measures the rate of alcohol in breath and prevents the driver from getting the car if he does not blow inside it, or in case it detects in the car an higher alcoholic concentration than permitted by law. 
The cost of the device, a bit more than 1000 euro, should be charged to the sanctioned. 
In this regard, a study conducted in 2007 in the United States proved that vehicles equipped with these devices can reduce the infringements up to 65% during the first year of introduction. 
And in Spain it was estimated it could save around 115 lives in one year. 
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: first of all to stop these behaviors before they turn into criminal offenses. 
And second, to facilitate the implementation of this practice, as the legal reform can be ordinarily made, but, on the contrary, the necessary reform of the criminal procedure requires to go through an organic law. 
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, even if it has already been introduced on an experimental basis in some trucks and public transports. 
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote a PSOE's initiative by which the party proposes to install the system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
