Indignant Dennis Quaid Strikes Back 
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about personal matters in an interview - and now she's in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan called her former husband Dennis Quaid an adulterer. 
The latter is fuming at her - and strikes back. 
Belated marital war between former spouses Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after divorcing, the two Hollywood actors are now engaged in an unsightly - and public - argument. 
In an interview with U.S. magazine `InStyle' last week, Meg Ryan had for the first time addressed the reasons for the failure of the marriage: `Dennis was cheating on me for a long time, and that was very painful.' 
She had only learned about the extent of his unfaithfulness after the divorce, she said. 
The occasion for her candor was Ryan's promotion of her new film `The Women' - which tells the story of an adultery. 
Dennis Quaid's reaction to being portrayed as a cheating husband was unequivocal: It was `outrageous,' the 54-year-old told the `New York Daily News,' that `Meg is repeatedly rehashing and revising the history of our relationship.' 
It was also `regrettable' that their common 16-year-old son Jack was again `publicly reminded of the pain and the upheavals a divorce brings for any child,' he said. 
While Ryan has been living on her own since the divorce, Quaid remarried and recently became the father of twins. 
He concluded his comments with a sideswipe. `My life has moved on, at any rate. 
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that is doing well.'
