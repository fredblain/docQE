About the financial crisis from the view of European newspapers 
The leading European newspapers were describing the ever-deepening international financial crisis as "a second September 11th" in their Tuesday comments. 
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - says the Rome-based La Repubblica blamingly - the president was not even able to have his own party back up the hastily prepared bill which is supposed to find the way out of the depressing situation... 
It is not so much a new Pearl Harbor, as Warren Buffett billionaire investor described it, but rather a second September 11th. 
Some of the Madrid press also blame Washington for the situation. 
In the view of El Mundo, the collapse of the world economy is due to the lack of political leadership in the U.S. 
The American financial system is at a growing risk of collapse, which will make the whole world suffer. 
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, now - pursuant to the congressional vote - the threatening risk is if Washington does not provide any political tool to handle the crisis. 
World economy is hanging in the air - just at the time when one of the biggest transformation of capitalism is taking place. 
"The threat cannot be ignored any more", marks the Tages-Anzeiger from Geneva. 
Some countries are still able to provide a life-belt for the weakened financial institutions and can save those from bankruptcy by the money of the taxpayers. 
However, if further banks collapse, as in a domino-effect, neither the funds nor new improvisations will help. 
What we need in the long term is that the members of the European Union shall determine themselves to overcome their own national selfishness and centralize the control over the divided financial markets. 
"The aid distributed just on Monday among the ailing financial institutes was more than 100 billion euros", recalls the Vienna-based Der Standard, adding that the worries are getting to point out that, just like the Americans, the European taxpayers will also have to dig down into their pockets in order to remedy the situation. 
The EU has not paid special attention to the crisis so far, which is now sweeping through the old continent as a tsunami. 
It is not expected from the "savers" to wave 100 billion euros in their hands right at the beginning but it would be important to determine the situations when the taxpayers' money is necessary to be used in order to prevent a more serious damage.
