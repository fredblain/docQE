Obama? The first anti-American President. Here is why? 
A famous American politician, who would like to pass off as independent, wrote: Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had dealings (as he still does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam". 
Attacks on Obama increase right as the election date nears. 
A lady from Miami has written on the web: "This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama is being cheeky: he thinks he can win the highest position in a country which has had in total two governors and five senators that were black!". 
In reality, these are attacks that don't mean a lot: they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the electors' question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; all of them say that Obama will win and by a wide margin. 
Even in this case there are those who speak from the heart and not from the head. 
A Mississippi newspaper, deep in the South of the United States, wrote an editorial: once inside the voting cabin we know well enough to whom the American patriot will give his vote. 
A side of the United States mentality that has been kept under wraps to the last, emerges. 
"Say whatever you like, afterwards we'll take care of where to put the cross, for Obama or for McCain". 
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will go away from America. 
Things that have never been said before now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain. 
However, in spite of all these arguments, the winning trump for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 people have been asked what have been the errors committed by Bush during his mandate? 89 per cent have answered: Iraq. 
America changes. 
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home with its tail between its legs. 
In Iraq 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack up and leave. 
Yet, for the majority Iraq has been the weak point of Bush. 
Whoever takes up the place of George W. will have an enormous task to do.
