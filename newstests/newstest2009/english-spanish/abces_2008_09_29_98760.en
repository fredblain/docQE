Weather hampers the Pozoblanco festival, which remains with no bullfights 
The bullfights which were to seal the days of the festival of Pozoblanco were suspended yesterday morning after the bull fighters had assured that the square's soil conditions were not adequate for the celebrations. 
Therefore, the company, together with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the bullfighting. 
The weather was rather fierce against this Festival and prevented two over three celebrations. 
Saturday, the rain had prevented the holding of the second bullfight. 
The billboard included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who would have faced a bull of Castilblanco. 
So far, the only celebration took place on Friday. 
This was the triumph of Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was brought on shoulders after he had bull fought with taste and aesthetics. 
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfights and collected greetings and one ear, granted by the public more than by the quality of the bullfight itself. 
Among all, the worst was El Juli, who passed by the bull-ring of Los Llanos gaining no glory, no penalty. 
With the second bull, after a tremendous muleta, he earned the boos of a bigger part of the public.
