Abducted Tourists in Egypt Released 
After being held hostage by their captors for ten days, the tourists abducted in Egypt have evidently been released, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister. 
The abductors from Sudan had demanded a ransom of several million Euros. 
In a shoot-out preceding the rescue, six of their captors were reportedly killed. 
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been abducted. 
Negotiations concerning a ransom are reportedly already underway. 
Time and again, Germans end up in the crosshairs of kidnappers. 
`Welt Online' reports the most notable cases. 
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara have apparently been freed. 
Reports by Egyptian state television, the Arabian TV channel al-Arabiya and Italian media are in accordance on that. 
According to Italian TV channel Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: `Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed. 
Right now we are checking their health,' Frattini said. 
The five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions were safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported. 
The 19 participants of a desert expedition were already on their way to Cairo, it said. 
The circumstances of the shoot-out preceding the release remain unclear: According to an Egyptian security agent, the captors were ready to end the abduction when the Sudanese army suddenly killed six of the abductors. 
`The problem had been solved. 
They had agreed to a ransom,' the agent said. 
It had been `only a matter of receiving the hostages,' when suddenly `this surprise' happened. 
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers had shot dead six of the abductors and taken two as prisoners in the border region between Sudan, Chad and Egypt. 
The abductors had demanded a ransom of six million Euros from Germany; the money was to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages. 
Citing a German negotiator, the daily newspaper `El Masri El Jom' reported that the release was being delayed because the kidnappers were fearing for their safety. 
According to the report, the abductors intended to release the female hostages once the ransom had been paid. 
The men were to be held captive until the abductors would have secured an escape route. 
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
