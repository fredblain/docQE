IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK IS WONDERING, IS ITALY RACIST? 
Italy "from a country of emigrants has recently been transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants" reluctantly received. 
Is this transforming the â€˜Belpaese' into a nation of racists? This is what is being questioned in a long article in the New York Times, which has dedicated a lengthy article to the debate on the theme of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for having stolen a box of biscuits. 
This case proves what the New York Times calls the "northern paradox": the northern regions are simultaneously the areas where there is "most integration and most work" but also where there is "the highest anti-immigrant feelings in the country and the highest support for the Northern League". 
As a confirmation of the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants the NYT has also cited the incidents of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino, and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
Even the new legislation from the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is advanced as a paradigm of the change in climate in Italy. 
A trend that has been highlighted by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic "Giorgio Napolitano who meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal has asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
