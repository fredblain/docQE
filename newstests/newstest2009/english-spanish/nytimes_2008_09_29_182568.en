Obscure City Street, Often Forgotten and Perhaps Soon for Sale 
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other byways, some famous, others merely utilitarian. 
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it. 
The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street - without making it to Second Street - between the Bowery and Second Avenue. 
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it resembles a dusty alleyway more than an active thoroughfare. 
There are no street signs. 
It is virtually impossible to see on a standard atlas. 
The street does, however, have admirers. 
For instance, there is Avalon Bay, the developer of recently constructed luxury buildings on First Street. 
It wants to repave Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who said they were charmed by the truncated lane simply because it was one of the last remnants of the block's pregentrified past. 
But the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in holding on to it. 
At a meeting of the neighborhood community board's land use committee this month, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the developer to buy the street. 
But the committee prefers that the street remain in the city's hands, and it asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district manager of Community Board 3. 
"There's very little city-owned space left, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," she said. 
"There could be proposals to fix it up and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access." 
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repave the little street and install seats, including some to be used by a cafe to which the developer expects to lease space. 
The idea that Avalon Bay might buy the street was first made public at this month's meeting. 
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that though the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it. 
"Avalon Bay's principal concern is refurbishing this derelict alleyway and turning it into a public amenity," she said, adding that the city had suggested the sale. 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Housing Preservation, said it was indeed the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it. 
Compared with its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a light historical footprint. 
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was split up among several of his children and the narrow strip of land was unclaimed. 
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened onto Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the setting for the cover photograph of the Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia." 
"The ground was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976. 
"It was filled with junk, shreds of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes." 
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public. 
Others have lauded Extra Place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged sliver of the city that ought to be left alone. 
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), posted part of a Talk of the Town story about Extra Place that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow little dead-end street, dark even by day and marked off by rusty iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows, with week-old newspapers blowing along the gutters." 
With a few exceptions, the street looked much the same on a recent evening. 
A rat skittered across the back of the street near a door that used to lead into CBGB, which is now the site of an upscale clothing store. 
Graffiti was on walls and an empty 22-ounce beer bottle lay near a fresh batch of discarded newspapers. 
A few passersby said that they rarely thought about Extra Place but suggested that it could use some sprucing up. 
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he thought that some people were underestimating the appeal of the street in its current state. 
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places that were dark, damp and disgusting."
