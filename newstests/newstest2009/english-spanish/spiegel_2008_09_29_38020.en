Rats Have Feelings, Too 
When in danger, a rat or roach will run away. Does it mean they experience fear, too? 
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings, as well. 
But if they act the same way we do, how could it be determined whether they also experience the same feelings? 
The Internet magazine `Edge' has been running pieces by famous scientists for years. 
In a series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a selection of responses to the question, `What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it?' 
I believe that animals have feelings, as well as other modes of awareness, although neither I nor anybody else have been able to prove it to date. For that matter, we haven't even been able to prove that other people possess awareness. 
But in that case, we can at least hope, since all human brains possess the same basic configuration. 
As soon as we turn to other species and raise questions on feelings or awareness in general, however, we are entering difficult terrain, because the hardware is not compatible. 
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: It plays possum, runs away or attacks. 
Humans behave similarly, which leads some scientists to conclude that the subjective experience is comparable. 
But I don't believe that. 
There are two aspects of our brain structure that make it difficult to project our subjective experience onto animals. 
For one thing, those circuits almost always involved in human awareness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to the part it plays in short-term memory and executive and control functions). 
This broad region is more advanced in humans than it is in other primates, and it seems to be entirely missing in other creatures. 
So at least as far as these aspects of our awareness depending on the prefrontal cortex are concerned - among them the knowledge who we are and the ability to plan and to make decisions - there is reason to assume that humans are distinct even from other primates. 
Another dramatic distinction is likely to consist in man's linguistic nature: Because such a vast part of what humans experience is tied to language, it's often said that their awareness depends on it. 
In that case, animals could be excluded. 
But even if awareness was not dependent on language, it would certainly be affected by it, meaning that animal awareness, however it may be defined, would likely be very different from most of our states of awareness. 
That's why it is so difficult to determine what animal awareness may be like. 
If you have something that, being internal and subjective, can be neither measured nor - due to its special hardware - analyzed according to our own experience, then its study comes with significant challenges. 
My explanation has mostly been concerned with the realm of conscious awareness, but aside from that, there is another important aspect of awareness that is more easily accessible scientifically. 
Animal awareness processes can be studied regardless of their content, and that's exactly what's happening in the study of the short-term memory of primates, particularly when it comes to the example of visualization. 
But this approach, which was followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, is concerned with the neural correlates of awareness rather than the causal mechanisms, which may or may not be identical. 
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the significance of the prefrontal cortex for the generation of the visualization. 
What does this mean for feelings, now? 
Let me remind you that an emotional system like that of fear is triggered in a brain that's aware of its own activity. 
What we call `fear,' consequently, is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its effects, such as physical reactions) is using virtual memory. 
From that perspective, feelings are closely tied to those regions of the cortex which are unique to primates, and humans in particular. 
In conjunction with the linguistic nature, the result are delicate emotional shades, because through words and grammar we can differentiate between states and categorize them, in order to project them onto others as well. 
In contrast to this, Antonio Damasio supposes, for instance, that feelings result from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortext and the brainstem concerned with bodily sensations. Jaak Pankseep says something similar, but his focus is more on the brainstem. 
Since this network hadn't changed in the course of human evolution, they say, it might well be a cause of cross-species sensations. 
In theory, I can't disagree with that, but I consider it improvable. 
Pankseep argues that what seemed to be fear with rats and humans probably felt like it, as well, in both cases. But how can we determine whether rats and humans feel the same thing when they act in similar ways? 
A roach's response to danger is flight. Does it experience fear? 
As far as I'm concerned, a mere similarity of actions is not sufficient proof for an identity of experiences. 
The neural comparison is helpful, granted: Rats and humans have similar brainstems, whereas roaches do not even have brains. 
But is the brainstem responsible for emotions? 
And even if it could be proved for humans - how would one want to prove it for rats? 
I believe rats and other mammals - maybe even roaches (who knows?) - have emotions. 
But I wouldn't know how to prove it. 
And because their feelings are supposedly fundamentally different from ours (since human awareness is based on specific circuits and on language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats. 
There is the promise of results on the neural level here, in any case, provided the same can be measured in rats and humans. 
Just like I don't study language and awareness in rats, neither do I study their emotions, given that I don't even know if they exist. 
One may consider that to be short-sighted, but I prefer to make progress, rather than to keep hitting a wall. 
I just happen to be a practical emotionalist.
