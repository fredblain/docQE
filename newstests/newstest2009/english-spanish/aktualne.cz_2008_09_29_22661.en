You don't think - you pay! 
Emotive campaign attacks drivers 
The most expensive action aimed at safety on the roads in Czech history. 
That's also one way to characterize the emotive media campaign which the Ministry of Transportation plans to launch on Wednesday. 
The office of minister Aleš Řebíček hopes that it will discourage drivers from behaving dangerously behind the wheel. 
The 150-million-crown campaign will appear on television, on the radio, in cinemas, on the Internet, but also on flyers. 
It should discourage drivers from speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol. 
And also remind them to fasten their seatbelts before they start driving. 
Above all, it aims to reach into the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, and last but not least, professional drivers. 
And what appears in the spots? 
Mainly human stories that attack the emotions. 
And even the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign attests to this: 
You don't think - you pay! 
The words "you don't think" are written in capital letters on a license plate. 
And then the words "you pay" are in a pool of blood. 
This is meant to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of carelessness with his/her own life. 
The spots will "haunt" the viewers until 2010. 
The ministry found inspiration in similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is common to find pictures with drastic images of accident victims. 
It hopes that the accident rate and the number of deaths on the Czech roads will thus decrease. 
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
Sugar and whip for drivers 
"The drivers are influenced by the sugar and whip system. 
The sugar for them is, for example, when they run a red light, they save time. 
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident. 
The drivers must be repeatedly reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a transportation psychologist from Na Homolce Hospital. 
And that's why information campaigns in the press and mainly negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist believes. 
Less effective in his opinion are the tables which draw the drivers' attention to the danger. 
"If a static table which warns against danger is installed, it will likely soon blend in with the surroundings and the drivers will not pay attention to it," Kořán warned.
