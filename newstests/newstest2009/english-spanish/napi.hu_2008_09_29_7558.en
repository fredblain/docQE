The written version of the bill on the 700 billion dollar economic bailout package has been drawn up. The draft law, applicable in several instalments, aims to purchase bad banking loans. 
In the first round, half of the amount is planned to be spent. 
"During the further reconciliations having come to an end on Saturday night, East Coast time, the congressional leaders managed to agree on the debate of several days, which concerned the 700 billion dollar bailout package", the Reuters confirmed. 
"We have taken an important step forward", declared Nancy Pelosi, democratic chairwoman of the House of Representatives, adding that the only thing needed was to work out the written form of the agreement. 
The compromise on the package has been supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain as well. 
Referring to the results of the compromise, Henry Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury declared: the programme is going to work well and going to be efficient, but further steps are still to be taken. According to Pelosi, it is not about rescuing Wall Street but to turn the direction of the economy. 
The written form of the package has been published at 8 pm on Sunday, Washington time, at the opening time of the Asian markets (at 2 am in Central-Europe) but it did not cause much rising on the stock exchange market. 
The draft legislation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 will be put to the vote on Monday, first in the House of Representatives, secondly in the Senate. 
President George W. Bush talked to Pelosi on Saturday night, then the news on the agreement was welcomed in the White House as well. 
"We are satisfied with what we have reached during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of the two parties in order to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", declared Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House. 
The programme differs from the proposal having been first submitted by the Bush-administration with the aim of spending the 700 billion dollars on purchasing low quality mortgage-backed securities. 
Now in the first round a maximum of 50 percent of the USD 700 billion can be used in a way that USD 250 billion shall instantly be spent since the Congress is expected to vote on the issue on Monday. One part of this amount will be spent on buying low quality mortgage-backed securities. An additional amount of USD 100 billion is still waiting for the president to decide how to be used. 
The programme will be supervised by a separate body with the involvement of the chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
On how to spend the rest of the 700 billion dollars will be decided by the Congress. 
Pursuant to the law, the Secretary of the Treasury is entitled to apply a combined tactic: it can buy bad loans, mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and other types of "poisonous" credits. 
The purchase can be realized on auctions or in a direct way, according to the Treasury. 
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the worrisome assets will be guaranteed by the Treasury and the companies will pay fees equivalent to the expected damages. 
Henry Paulson declared: pursuant to the law, the required assets are provided depending on the situation; it might be an aid of USD 700 billion urgently needed by the American financial system, due to either the widespread purchase of bad assets, or the insurance of those, or even the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of some significant financial institutes. 
"We will make the necessary arrangements in order to be ready for the implementation of the law, as soon as it has been signed", he added. 
The directors of the troubled banks waiting for state aid should count on that their severance - which is simply called golden parachute in the overseas slang - will be restricted by the government. 
The restriction of payments is introduced in certain cases only, limitations depend on the nature of the support provided by the Treasury. 
Restriction means that in case the Treasury purchases on auction, surtax is imposed on the golden parachute, unless the ruined bank director is sent to retirement. 
In the course of buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that the amounts of managerial money are not exaggerated. 
It must be added that the existing golden parachute contracts will not be amended, restriction applies only to the new ones in order to encourage participation in the programme. 
"This is the first time in American history that legal restriction will be imposed regarding the remuneration of chief executive officers", commented House Financial Service Committee Chairman Barney Frank, of the Democratic Party. 
Besides, the government will be conferred with the right of holding acquisition, this way taxpayers' risk will reduce, since they might even profit from the issue as soon as both the economy and the rescued bank is recovered. 
The bill includes that the president is obliged to submit a proposal to the Congress within the next 5 years, which specifies how the expected losses will be returned to the taxpayers from the financial sector. 
Sceptics gave voice for their doubts regarding the plan on both sides, too. 
"This is not what American citizens expect from us, this will not protect taxpayers' dollars", stated Republican Representative Darrell Issa from California. 
His Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur declared the arrangements have been encouraged by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
