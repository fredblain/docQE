"Sangre de mayo", an epic challenge by Garci. 
Jose Luis Garci, inspired by the novel Episodios Nacionales of Banito Pérez Galdós, recreates in Sangre de mayo the spanish popular riot against the French. This is the most ambitious work of his filmography, with a nearly 15 million euro budget. 
With this film, the director has tried to "explain the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he said today, during the film's presentation, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría heading a larger cast of interpreters. 
Sangre de mayo, a film longer than 2.30 hours, debuts this Friday at the cinemas, to become a four hours TV miniseries on TeleMadrid in next future. 
Great fan of Galdós' literature, Jose Luis Garci claims this shooting realized "a dream of his childhood". He likes to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who, three years earlier, had commissioned him to shoot a film to commemorate the second centenary of the Madrid 2nd of May. This was the desire expressed by the Community of Madrid. The director agreed on condition that the story grounded on the novel Episodios Nacionales. 
The 15 million budget totally allocated by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate sets and costumes to portray a "stunned Spain that chose the wrong leader to fight for and the fact that the fight for independence led people to a huge delay in development during the reign of Ferdinand VII" said Garci. 
However, the director regrets not having received equal funds of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice compared to Sangre de mayo. So far, it was not possible to shoot some scenes included in the plan, he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, his career-long collaborator. 
The difference of budget influenced the usual way of working of the director of Volver a empezar: for example, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to rehearse before shooting together with the ones who do not belong to the cast, considering this "humiliating" and thinking that "the work of the director lies in going to the theatre and to the cinema to realize how the industry he is working for is going on." 
A certain number of interpreters, some of which fall within the cast of Sangre de mayo, repeat in front of his video-camera. It is the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo. 
Four times in the Oscar nominations - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three candidate films to represent Spain at Hollywood this year, his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés, and the Los selected ulitmo girasoles ciegos do represent the Spanish cinema's younger generation, "that should be known instead." 
Garci does not expect awards from this film. 
"At first you think of working for posterity, then you realize you only work for the prosperity, and at certain point you just shoot a film more," says Garcia after more 30 years of career.
