Rome, Alemanno gives the go ahead to the Commission for the  Future of the Capital 
Today it starts, in March it concludes, in June the conclusions are drawn. 
This is the schedule set by the Campidoglio for the "Commission for the Future of the Capital", which has this morning taken up residence at its new premises behind the Caracalla Hot Springs. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will set down the guidelines for Rome. 
Once the project has been concluded in March, the Municipal Board and Council will evaluate the analysis and projects, so that in June the strategic plan for Rome can be presented with the official stamp of the Campidoglio and the mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
"The commission is absolutely independent and all political opinions, social, and cultural are represented – underlines Alemanno – It should make proposals for a development plan of Rome on which the political executives, which are always the Municipal Board and Council, can rely. 
There is no superposition of roles but only the will to have a place where a big project for Rome can be drawn up. 
In March its job will be done and it will dissolve, because this experiment should have a precise deadline. 
In June – the mayor announces – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital". 
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals. 
If the quality is there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I'm sure there will be in Rome, then its contribution will be fundamental. 
Too often politics are overwhelmed by everyday administration and by emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time. 
On the contrary, we want to look further forwards and further ahead, with a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future. 
Furthermore, the mayor of Rome would like to point out that "this commission is neither a useless agency nor an unwieldy bureaucratic organisation: it's absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a cent and it will serve to get reasoning and get involved the best minds that the Capital has to offer". 
For Alemanno, in fact, "it's essential to have a strategic reference plan, not closed or inflexible, to permit our city to do an authentic leap in quality, which it really needs, thinking with a united spirit of its future. 
A future that, specifies the Mayor of Rome "will not limit itself to the current municipal borders but will look further afield" not only with the view of a future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also with consideration to the role that Rome could and must perform as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
