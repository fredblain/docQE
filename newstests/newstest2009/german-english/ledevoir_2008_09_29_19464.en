Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals 
The Montreal Impact has qualified for the semi-final round of the playoffs for the first division of USL, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the series quarter-finals on total goals at the Saputo Stadium. 
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute on Thursday. 
After a first half with nothing but aimlessly going from one side to another, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the net of the Montreal formation. 
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders. 
Recall that during the first game of the series rounds, on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle. 
The Impacts will have to measure up to the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final. 
Saturday night at Minnesota, Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return match to win 4-3, but Whitecaps nevertheless acceded to the semi-final round 5-4 on total goals. 
Impact will face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
