Oil Falls Sharply on Renewed Economic Fears 
Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the American bailout plan for the financial markets may fail to revive the economy. 
Crude oil futures fell as much as 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange in morning trading. 
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday. 
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, and a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
After reaching a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before once again jumping back up on the back of tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets. 
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday even after Congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the bailout plan, the largest in history. 
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over. 
In the latest episode of the unfolding meltdown, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday. 
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis. 
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic weekend negotiations that led to the bailout agreement "appear to have failed to revive market sentiment." 
As the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to slow down. 
"The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate markets has become increasingly uncertain," analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors. 
"We believe commodities will be unable to escape the contagion. 
From a commodity perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the US virus spreads globally and specifically to China." 
The bank's analysts pared down their expectations for next year as oil consumption drops because of slowing economic growth, reducing their oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
