Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Prevention is crucial" 
Everyday, in Italy, at work 2500 accidents occur, 3 persons die and 27 remain permanently invalid. 
For 2007, INAIL data confirm that in fact work related deaths have been around 1200. 
Figures that witness the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the principal causes of death and causes almost double the deaths with respect to homicide. 
To recall the attention of institutions, social forces and information media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil is celebrating in all the Italian provinces the 58th National Day for Casualties of Accidents at Work, institutionalised onto the second Sunday of October. 
"The worrying data diffused by Anmil and the very same tragic current news confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at the workplace is", declares the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in his message to the president of Anmil, National Association of the Mutilated and Invalids at Work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of the State expresses his "deep appreciation of the constant associative efforts for prevention at the workplace, caring for injured workers, assistance of the casualties' families, and the sensitization of public opinion". 
"Naturally, an indignant ‘enough' has been raised, sincerely shared in front of tragedies that, due to their size, provoke an outcry by the media and the involvement of public opinion but everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, whose dynamics are even repetitive". 
Napolitano does not conceal that "undoubtedly there's also a resources problem: it's important to invest in training and information. 
A particular significance is assumed by the numerous initiatives promoted within the schools in raising awareness of the younger generation that face the work market. 
It's a duty to keep alive the awareness of the phenomenon, not give up to its serious social alarm, apply and improve the legislative provisions. 
On his part the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has underlined "as the phenomenon of accidental deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, that offends the conscience of each and every one of us and imposes on all the institutions a decisive obligation towards urgently ending it". 
"Data regarding injuries at the workplace seem to signal a small positive trend, but this does not take away the fact that the number of accidental deaths is in any case impressive", remarked the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want, in fact, that this ‘downturn trend' is translated into a reduced alertness, because it is just when the attention is reduced that tragedy explodes. 
"We believe that at a general level little is being done to oppose the phenomenon of industrial injury and the fight could be carried on through multiple actions. 
It is necessary, in our opinion, - underlined Mercandelli – to have more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the worker training, and this should start at school". 
"A greater effort is required – he added – with regards to the communication and sensitization of public opinion. 
But, above all, a greater sense of responsibility is required on behalf of employers in respect of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency". 
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of care benefit provided for casualties at work" and the "welfare drift which the system is taking in the last few years". 
"Hence, the objective is to restore to the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – so that the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on spontaneous political actions or grants which are from time to time set out by legislators".
