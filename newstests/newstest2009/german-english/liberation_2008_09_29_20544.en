Obama, who won on points the first televised duel 
To the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House has succeeded another to see who, John McCain or Barack Obama, won. 
Not surprisingly, the campaign headquarters of the Republicans and the Democrats have declared their own victory in the televised duel which was watched by a third of American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though admirable, was not "brilliant" enough to enable it to reverse its decline in the polls five weeks from the presidential election. 
The Gallup, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives a five points lead to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that the Democrats have pulled their own on Thursday. 
According to a CBS poll, among the undecided voters, who are those that count, Obama has won 39% of respondents, while 25% of them give victory to McCain. 
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin. 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her. 
She has good instincts nonetheless", warned Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagenarian McCain has repeatedly put forward his unquestionable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this initial face-to-face debate. 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that ..." he accused several times. 
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president," he also assured. 
An angle of attack hammered yesterday in Republican television advertisements. 
Obama, himself, has stressed that he represented the future. 
Without disassembling, he was concise and precise. 
He put forward his ability to make the right decisions and to restore the image of the United States in the world. 
"McCain has never understood, while Obama, if", argued this weekend, a Democratic spot criticizing the Republican of not taking the whole measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American on the streets". 
"During the ninety-ten minute debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday to 20 000 people assembled for an electoral meeting in North Carolina in the pouring rain. 
He did not even utter the words "middle class" or "workers". "The financial crisis clearly gives an advantage to Obama, who is considered by Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the brink of a precipice. 
"The coming week could be a turning point", estimated yesterday the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer. 
The Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an alumnus of the Clinton administration, compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis. 
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis "is the final verdict of eight years of poor economic policies implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain". 
Reaffirming that he would still reduce the taxes of 95% of the Americans despite the turmoil on Wall Street, the senator from Illinois also reported that the achievement of the country's energy independence by promoting renewable energy was his first priority, together with the establishment of a system of health insurance. 
McCain, he wanted to build a cluster of 45 nuclear plants by 2030. 
Cautious, both candidates have dodged questions about the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion Euro) adopted yesterday by Congress and extremely unpopular.
