Meat Loaf's epic to be honoured 
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honoured at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell. 
The singer, who will collect his special golden award at next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honoured" to gain recognition. 
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's hit 1977 album. 
Coldplay are leading the nominations for this year's awards, making the shortlists of four categories. 
Paul Rees, Q magazine's editor-in-chief, said: "There are some songs that transcend such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is assuredly one of them." 
The song, penned by Jim Steinman, required a huge vocal which was delivered by Meat Loaf. 
It opened with an instrumental section which lasted almost two minutes. 
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number 15. 
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell album spent around nine years in the chart and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide. 
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage. 
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts. 
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal chord.
