Dark Matter Affects Flight of Space Probes 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has had researchers stumped: Dark matter is affecting the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers. 
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct. 
For almost 18 years, the probe `Ulysses' has been flying through space. 
Due to freezing fuel lines, it is now threatening to shut down. 
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the Swing-By Anomaly. 
The swing-by is a flight maneuver during which space probes gain additional acceleration in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth. 
It enables the probes to save a lot of fuel. 
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens made use of this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses. 
But what researches have been wondering about for years is this: The objects in flight are not behaving precisely in the way we have come to expect according to the venerable law of gravitation. 
Rather, there are irregularities in their speed. 
The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower. 
To date, physicists have been unable to explain this effect. 
They have dubbed it the Swing-By Anomaly. 
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the gravitational pull of matter through a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein did not err, and is trying to explain the Swing-By Anomaly by way of the so-called dark matter that astronomers discovered in the universe. 
`It could be dark matter existing very close to Earth that may be responsible for the anomaly,' he writes. 
Space researchers have only been aware of the existence of dark matter for about ten years. 
Evidently, it emits a gravitational force whose effect on other celestial bodies is measurable. 
The dark matter itself is completely invisible, however, meaning that it neither sends nor emits any electromagnetic radiation whatsoever, such as, consequently, visible light in particular. 
According to the scientists' calculations, dark matter constitutes as much as one fifth of all matter in the universe.
