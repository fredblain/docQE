USA, the economic depression is being felt also by the journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, "killer" of the printed paper. 
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by PEW Research Centre what they think of the state of their profession and mental control as regards to the future. 
Well, nowadays journalists are almost all of them pessimistic regarding their future. 
Yet, to the information clerks, they have not openly declared to be less worried with respect to credibility. 
They don't feel as isolated as they used to. 
The problem for American journalists is the money, the money. 
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model. 
Furthermore the cuts carried out in the newsroom, the office where editors work to assemble the newspaper, are a big problem. 
It's a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want that traditional journalism as it is understood by the general public is substantially diminished. 
A clear but complex pessimism nowadays pervades American journalists. 
Six out of ten journalists of the printed press and senior executives are convinced that journalism at a national level is going down the wrong road. 
Within the local field the executive group is 65%. 
Printed against broadcast. 
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going. 
The major publishing houses are opening a passage for themselves towards the internet, by many seen as the "assassin" of the printed paper. 
The "economic pressure" that journalists have felt has increased up to 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology hoping that it "will do some good" for their journalism. 
The biggest rift in American journalism nowadays is between those who manage the newsrooms – that is the directors – and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of managers at national level are certain that their reporters share their values, whilst at local level the percentage decreases to 23%. 
For some this has got to do with "job security". 
On a national level, 43% of the managers believe they will lose their jobs within 3 years. 
For journalists the figure is 30%. 
As for "job security" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America it varies on a day to day basis. 
Only 13% of journalists have a work contract. 
In an immense nation such as the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journals, magazines, radio, TV, and internet employers offer whatever they want and hence it becomes a question of take it or leave it. 
Directors almost always receive huge salaries, while an editor may earn 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to the pension and paid insurances. 
As for holiday, things get complicated: so many days the first year, so many days after the third to get to a total of 15 days after a certain number of years. 
But American journalists, by their own admission, fall frequently "ill" during the year. 
It's all a question of climate.
