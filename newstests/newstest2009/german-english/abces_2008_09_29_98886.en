The actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving while addicted with drugs 
The actress Heather Locklear, Amanda of the popular series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) after driving under the influence of drugs. 
A witness viewed her performing inappropriate maneuvers while trying to take her car out from a parking in Montecito, as revealed to People magazine by a spokesman for the Californian Highway Police. 
The witness stated that around 4.30pm Ms. Locklear "crushed the accelerator very thoroughly, making excessive noise and trying to take the car out from the parking with abrupt back and forth maneuvers. By reversing, she passed several times in front of his sunglasses." 
Shortly after, the witness, who, in a first time, apparently had not recognized the actress, saw Ms. Locklear stopping in a nearby street and leaving the vehicle. 
It was this person to alert the emergency services, because "he was concerned about Ms. Locklear's life." 
When the patrol arrived, the police found the actress sitting inside her car, which was partially blocking the road. 
"She seemed confused," and for this reason the policemen led her to a specialized centre for drugs and alcohol and submitted her a test. 
According to a spokesman for the police, the actress has proven collaborative and the hypothesis of excessive alcohol was discarded since the very first moment, even if "as the officers observed at first sight, we believe Ms. Locklear was under the effect of any drug." 
Ms. Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of some - not better specified substance, and imprisoned in the local jail at 7.00pm, to be released some hours later. 
Two months ago, Ms. Locklear was out of a specialist clinic in Arizona where she was cured after an episode of anxiety and depression.
