Hepatitis: when shall we turn to a doctor? 
Approximately half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection. In Hungary, the chronic liver disease is mentioned among the main causes of mortality. 
Although the number of the Hungarians being infected by hepatitis can reach 100 000, only 7 000 of them are treated properly. The reason is that many times people are not aware of being infected. 
Hepatitis is a collective name of different infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses. 
Even though there are similarities in the symptoms, e.g. liver inflammation or jaundice, the nature of the pathogens and the caused diseases are different. 
Hepatitis viruses are transmitted in two main forms, depending on the type of the pathogens: hepatitis A and E travel through the alimentary tract (for example with infected food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and the other viruses are carried in blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal mucus, saliva). 
Those who travel a lot should protect themselves against viruses A and B by vaccination; but there is no vaccination against virus C. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear 2 or 3 weeks after having eaten the contaminated food; they are accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal problems, nausea. 
The next sign is jaundice appearing on the skin and in the white part of the eye. Additional symptoms are: light coloured faeces, dark urine. Recovery can take 2 or 3 weeks. 
Annually and worldwide, 1 million people die of the more serious type of the disease, hepatitis B, causing liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. 
The main reason is that only an estimated one-tenth of the infected receive medical treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also lead to serious problems: it may result in cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer if it is not treated. 
Most of the infected are not even aware of their illness since the pathogens destroy the liver cells over a long time, thus in many cases the first symptoms emerge 20 or 30 years later. 
From this point, early prevention, especially regular screening tests have fundamental significance. 
In three groups this illness is experienced highly above the average: among people having received blood transfusion before 1991, drug-addicts and those having tattoos. 
Currently, the number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C is around 200 million worldwide. 
Since the disease can be recognized by routine laboratory testing, it is worth seeing a doctor if any symptoms of unknown origin are observed. 
In case of early recognition, the disease can be cured, the virus can be destroyed, thus infectivity ceases and the induction of cancer can be prevented. 
30 September is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by the organizations representing the infected. 
It aims to call attention to chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, the causes of its induction and the significance of early recognition.
