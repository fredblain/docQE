Vargas Llosa admits the novel he's writing is a "chance" 
The novel sets in a place the author does not know yet and tells of an unknown subject. Despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with the new project he is working at, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who spent twenty years of his life in Congo and crossed Amazon. 
The writer, always favoured for the Nobel Prize in Literature, confessed yesterday during the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the draft he is dealing with is a "chance" and that everything indicates that I should not write it down." 
"If I had good sense, I do not write it at all, but I'm going ahead anyway and I hope to finish it once and for all," he concluded his speech at this festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that saw many guests, during the four days, passing by the Aqueduct's city. Hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people joined it. 
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was a prominent figure in the third edition of the word's festival, as forecasted. 
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize being the most voted writer by participants - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend" by Dickens, packed the theatre Juan Bravo with fans. 
Introduced by FÃ©lix Romeo, the writer faced a public whose time flew away when the Peruvian author, started to recall with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humour, the way he discovered his literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure and the pleasure of reading." This is "living beyond life", as he put it in. He explained why orderly basis in writing permits "to remove the lack of inspiration," through an intense work of documentation, editing and revising. He underlined how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas affected his vocation and said that the "images of memory" are the foundation from which his stories spring up. 
The Hispanic-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way to measure how and how much books can affect people's lives. I refuse to believe that literature is a pure and ephemeral entertainment experience," said Vargas Llosa who, also supported that "the literature has a strong impact and pushes people to be nonconformist." So he suggested the writers "not to give into frivolity" and to "take the responsibility" of their own vocation.
