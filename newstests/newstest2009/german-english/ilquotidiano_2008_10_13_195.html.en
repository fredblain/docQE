Even Kohl tested positive, it is the fourth case of doping 
A new case of positive testing during the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the team Gerolsteiner, third in classification and winner of the best grimpeur shirt. 
Reporting the news is the daily newspaper L'Equipe. 
The 26 year old Kohl is the fourth cyclist tested positive to Cera, the third generation EPO, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc√≤ and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from the Gerolsteiner team. 
The analysis of the blood samples from Kohl form part of those performed within the last few weeks by the laboratories of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry. 
If the counter-analysis confirm the tests as positive to Cera, the Austrian will lose the third place at the Tour and faces the two-year canonical disqualification. 
Confirming the news of Kohl testing positive to the third generation Epo is the French anti-doping agency's chief, Pierre Bordry who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive test results. 
The 26 year old Austrian had placed himself on the finalist podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka-dotted shirt of the best grimpeur.
