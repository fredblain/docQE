When energy is born from the waves the big come into play 
It's an immense body, that occupies 70% of the planet's surface and now the big, international energy companies are discovering it. 
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources being eyed, and subjected to attempts of development, by colossi such as Chevron. 
The possibility of extracting energy from sea movement has been under study for a hundred years and in the 70's, coinciding with the first oil crisis, research was intensified. 
When the oil prices went down, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the appeals by the environmentalists and the new increases in oil prices have given impetus to the sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated that in 2007 15 percent of the world's electrical needs could be provided for by the exploitation of the seas' undulating motion. 
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power stations. 
And then there would be the currents and the tides. 
Colossi on the attack. 
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 has signed an agreement to construct a plant in the north of Portugal. 
When the understanding was announced it looked like a revolutionary step. 
Two years on there are more companies betting on marine energy and among these, there are companies that have always been devoted to traditional energy. 
"Chevron is researching technologies for oceanic energy – a spokesperson for a company associated to the U.S. oil giant has declared to the economy daily Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of collaborating with us". 
The cooperation in question regards the obtaining of a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to start a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska. 
This is a significant sign, especially if one considers that right in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has set in motion a plan for new drilling. 
Besides Chevron there are Verdant Power Inc. Of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the path of marine energy and the sums invested so far, even though they are not known in detail, indicate according to the observers an increasing interest. 
Technology to be made ready. 
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, marine energy does not put to rest all the doubts about its environmental impact. 
Till now the plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not appear to create big problems for the ecosystem. 
To produce energy on a large scale, however technologies with a higher environmental impact need to be implemented. 
And the choices are varied: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected between themselves. 
The thrust of the waves, which makes the buoys move up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floaters. 
The pressure turns a turbine which in its turn fuels a generator. 
The electricity is sent to shore through underwater cables. 
For now there are four plants of this kind being planned, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could be used by a military installation. 
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York's East River. 
The water movement when there are the sea tides makes the fans of the turbines go round, creating a rotary motion that powers a generator. 
Verdant has said that it has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisations to benefit from the energy. 
After the waves, the tides. 
Particular interest, declare the people at the Electrical Energy Research Institute, is deserved at the moment by the potential of tides. 
Even though it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, and so is more reliable as a source of energy. 
It's exactly on tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine, and Alaska, together with others that overlook the coast, have already invested 7.5 million dollars in 2008 and are foreseen investments of up to 35 million for 2009.
