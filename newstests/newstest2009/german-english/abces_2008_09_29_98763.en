"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" G체nther Bauer, photographer 
Neither heels nor ruffles or stage clothes. 
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration which characterizes the interpretation, to face a relaxed man or woman. 
On one hand, the artist. 
On the other, the person. 
The two sides are inseparable, except in private life. In those moments, away from the public, the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen glance or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural expressions because not prepared for the stage. 
German G체nther Bauer, in the work "Flamenco-People", alternates the theatricality of some shots of singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with these masters' private and less known being. 
This is the photograph's aim when collecting an original iconography of flamenco, taken from different perspectives. 
The exhibition, included in the Month of Flamenco Photography's program, reflects the importance of international flamenco, which increases day by day" the artist explains. He also clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" even it should be ordinary people, going through the pictures, the observers get these are not the classic images of artists, interpreters or performers on stage. 
The people I portrayed on the street "are" artists able to convey passion, sadness and joy when on stage ... and finally, to capture their audience. 
To catch the personality of these artists taking pictures of the scene is over. 
It is much more an inner personality and character. 
I'm very interested in creating an intimate atmosphere which permits me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco by my camera." 
Bauer began his path to portray singers, guitarists and dancers in 1997 with a deep passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas". He likes to use a plate camera. 
Due to the choice of the camera and the equipment, These portraits remember the classic photos. 
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the iconographic traditional principles, giving the photos modernity, as Bauer considers flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots which evolves and still surprises every day more." 
It is not the dancing, the singing or the playing itself, but the artist's personality, his character, able to conquer the audience through his art. 
The search for a meeting with the essentiality, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain feeling, are and have been constant elements in this work, now on display at the gallery El Fot처mata. 
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chan Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrija, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo among others, are included in this selection of around seventy portrayed artists. 
The project has also become an anthology of flamenco, going to be published in a book which collects the portraits displayed at the exhibition. 
The passion for the portrait led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes"("SportARTproject"). 
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to penetrate into their lives for a while, being this a long or short moment. 
I think portray is the most difficult subject in photography. 
You meet or face people and characters sometimes you even know or persons who bestow you only a few minutes to take the picture. 
Beyond circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas." 
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited at the gallery El Fot처mata, Via de la Mata 20, which is a parallel street to Alameda de Hercules. The exhibition will be open to public until the 16th of October.
