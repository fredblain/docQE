No Sleep for Hypo Real Estate Creditors 
As recently as last week, German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck stressed that the banking system of Germany was relatively stable. 
It's a good thing that the politician used the term `relatively,' further interjecting that the German banking sector wouldn't be spared by the crisis. 
Because that's what happened this weekend. 
The real-estate bank Hypo Real Estate (HRE) from Munich, which is listed in the DAX stock index, is receiving credits in the billions from a consortium of German banks in order to be shielded against the market turbulences. 
An individual close to the proceedings told Reuters on Monday that the credit line could be as high as 35 billion Euros total. 
Hypo Real Estate was only required to pay interest on the sum it ends up using, they said. 
The money was coming from private as well as public banks, they added. 
The news comes in the wake of losses at subsidiary Depfa. 
According to a news report, the government-funding bank had refinanced long-term projects it was financing on very short notice - which, due to the mistrust at the markets, is no longer a possibility. 
In the first half-year of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 Euros, with the capital resource quota also slightly declining from 1.6 to 1.45 percent. 
The ongoing earnings and net earnings from financial transactions had fallen to nil compared to the same period in the previous year, while earnings from write-ups on demands and specific bonds as well as from the liquidation of accruals from credit transactions had shrunk by more than 70 percent to 5 million Euros. 
The decline in earnings remained at a moderate 16 percent only thanks to higher earnings through refunds from downstream accounting costs from restructuring the former Depfa Group, as well as from refunds of interest according to the Fiscal Code and from agency for group companies. 
After going private in 1990, the former government-funding bank had initially incurred speculation losses through commercial real-esate credits, which were then outsourced to Aareal Bank. 
Because earnings in classical government-funding were slim, Depfa had diversified internationally, increasingly engaging in infrastructure projects and in the funding of joint ventures between private investors and the government (Public-Private Partnership, PPP). 
Now Hypo Real Estate has to induce write-offs according to the subsidiary's worth that will have a `significant, material effect' on the group's profit-and-loss statement, it said rather vaguely. 
As a matter of fact, the dividend has been omitted. 
It had already been reduced by two thirds in 2007. 
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a significant financer of government and infrastructure. 
Because it does not have client deposits, it is more dependent on refinancing at the interbank market than other banks. 
With the collapse two weeks ago of American investment bank Lehman Brothers, the extension of loans among banks has largely dried up again, because banks are hoarding their assets. 
For part of Depfa's loan portfolio - approximately 50 billion Euros - Hypo Real Estate annually requires short-term capital for refinancing. 
According to Hypo Real Estate, the credits meet the group's financing requirements for the foreseeable future, shielding the corporation from `the influence of the currently largely incapacitated international financial markets.' 
Other sources say that, thanks to the credits, refinancing is covered until late 2009. 
HRE chairman of the board Georg Funke said that, in the foreseeable future, the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to draw upon the financial markets again, however. 
The Deutsche Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) are now considering the Hypo Real Estate Group's marketability to be secured. 
On behalf of the bank's shareholders and creditors, it is to be hoped they are right. 
But given the dynamics and the unpredictability of the crisis, things are likely to remain uncertain. 
It's not even unthinkable that not all of the financing will be needed. 
The opposite cannot be discounted either, however. 
After the bank was reportedly close to insolvent late Sunday night, even a bailout, temporary as it is, is incapable of easing people's minds. 
The price per share is dropping by 75 percent to 3.30 Euros. 
Bond prices are holding up reasonably well, meanwhile. 
Whereas senior debts are hardly moving, junior bonds are dropping more significantly. 
This mainly applies to bonds of former subsidiary Wuerttemberg Hypo and, understandably, to repayment periods beyond 2009. 
To date, Hypo Real Estate bonds seemed to be an alternative for speculative investment. After the financial crisis, as well as the bank's own homemade crisis caused by the acquisition of Depfa, however, their recoverability has to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system. 
As long as central banks, governments and less stricken corporate banks are still willing to support the system, bond settlement deadlines can be met. 
Alternatively, that which nobody dares to hope for yet right now comes to pass, and the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months. 
But considering that one report of partial nationalization is chasing the next, a probability bordering on certainty has now shrunk to a valid hope. 
This may be causing some sleepless nights for long-term creditors in particular, as they ponder the question whether or not to abandon their exposure. 
Short-term investors may at least use the line that has been drawn as an opportunity to draft a loss carry-forward for the capital gains compensation tax payments of the years to come.
