Franz Walter analyses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article The Bavarian revolution is eating up its parents, released in the Internet publication of the left wing news magazine. 
According to the popular political scientist, the erosion of CSU had began far before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over the office. 
Christian socialists were doing reforms in Bavaria for long decades - at the present these modern citizens are the ones who turn away. 
The beginning of a new era means a problem for all Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel as well. 
The defeat did not really surprise CSU but a whole process ended on Sunday, a process that had been likely to happen in the last 10 years: the cessation of the indisputable hegemony of a state party. 
Ten years ago, in 1998 CSU landed on 47.7 percent, the first time under 50 percent since the fifties. 
It happened again 3 years ago, during the Bundestag election 2005, namely in the oft-mentioned Stoiber era. 
The reason for it was the consistent modernization carried out by CSU in the province, which eats up its parents. 
Sociologists have predicted it for 40 years but concerning its speed they were wrong. Nevertheless, secularization, educational results, the settling of Germans from the Eastern and Northern part of the country to the developing regions of Bavaria could not remain without consequences on the CSU loyalty of the voters. 
Modernisation comes together with the growth of opportunities and it has its own political consequences. 
The right wing is untouched, only the voters of the group have become more self-conscious, critical and wilful. 
What is also remarkable is that during the last weeks, mainly classical civil groups were departing from CSU; people of the liberal professions, industrial workers, people with secondary school certificate, people with college or university degree. 
CSU support here has been diminished to below 40 percent.

"Who, with whom? Party chairmen are reserved considering coalition issues" is the title of the article in which the Vienna-based conservative daily newspaper is analyzing the confusing domestic political situation developed after the Austrian elections. 
SPÖ intends to negotiate with ÖVP. 
ÖVP prohibits SPÖ to intervene to its internal issues. 
BZÖ seems open to negotiate in all directions, the greens do not wish to reconcile on coalition yet. 
The election has already taken place, now everything is about the coalition; during the debate organized by the public television, there was hardly any chance to gain insight into the party leaders' cards. 
SPÖ Chairman Werner Faymann confirmed his willingness to negotiate with ÖVP. 
SPÖ would like to show that the cooperation of the two parties is possible - it does exist in some of the provinces as well as in social partnership. 
Faymann left the question of a coalition with Wilhelm Molter as vice-chancellor - currently ÖVP chairman - open. 
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course has been rejected. 
Turning towards this direction again is out of question. 
Molterer was cautious in handling red offers. 
According to him, the cooperation by no means will be successful in case Faymann tries to intervene to the internal issues of ÖVP. 
Whether choosing to remain opposition or entering a coalition is still an open question in the party, this issue has definitely to be discussed within ÖVP. 
BZÖ Chairman Jörg Haider repeatedly seemed to be open to all alternatives. 
"In order to prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to undertake government responsibility", declared Haider.
