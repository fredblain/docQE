Speaking while sleeping 
Some children speak during the night. 
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something happened to them the day before, but those children who talk while asleep. 
The first time it happens, at most, you get scared, but it really does not have that much importance. 
This is a benign alteration of sleep, defined somniloquy. 
It is a quite common phenomenon, especially in children and adolescents. 
Certainly, most of you have been told talked in your sleep. 
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (just once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever) or on a more regular basis (every day, once a week, once in the month ...). The day after the child does not remember anything. 
There is not a single reason to explain the presence of somniloquy. 
Sometimes it should be linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, nocturnal enuresis (do pee in bed), or sleepwalking, but it is not necessarily the case. 
As mentioned above, it may be associated with stages of very high fever, in situations of stress or over excitement. 
In any case, this phenomenon is not researched that well. 
Even its intensity is extremely variable. 
It may happen a person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper, or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches ...). 
In case the event is particularly intense, the child should be observed and possibly, a specialist should be consulted to check if the abnormal state of anxiety is due to any question, thus is generated by the child in order to vent his feelings. 
We said that this is a benign alteration, therefore there is not a specific treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders which, instead, can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or a situation of stress). 
What you can do instead is taking into consideration a number of very simple preventive measures, such as: 
Try not to over-excite the child before going to sleep. 
Propose calm games and avoid television programs or series that inspire fear or suggest violence. 
Very nervous children for whom relaxing is a very hard task, need you use relaxation techniques to help them acquire a certain inner calm. 
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully. 
Once somniloquy appears, try to keep calm. 
Remember that it is an inoffensive phenomenon for the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of it. 
Useful Tips 
Don't wake him up. 
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is going on, and you just interrupt his sleeping. 
Although he is talking, he is asleep and thus, he is resting. 
Remember that if he appears very anguished and the episodes have a certain frequency is better to consult a doctor or to verify from where such a great anxiety comes from. 
If you get what he is saying (which is not the most common situation) does not fall into temptation to make him an interrogation to obtain information. 
Do not get anything, because he is sleeping and he is not conscious to organize his thoughts. 
In addition, you are only able to hear what he says but you cannot see what he is dreaming about to say that things. Therefore, be very careful with any interpretation of the information you get and about the conclusions you might lead. 
Do not ever tell your child you could ask him something during the night to know his secrets. 
Not even jokingly. 
This can generate a huge anxiety. 
In short, do not worry, it's nothing serious, just an episode that lasts few minutes.
