1001, the number anti-stress 
It is not 1000 but 1000 and 1 the way to forget the chaotic and hectic everyday life. 
And if it seems not enough, all these ways have been collected in a book which will bring the relax to the bookstores by the 30th of September. 
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when ringing every morning at 7 o'clock, but the worst is imaging yourself involved in the frantic pace dictated by modern life. 
Office means tension, computer back pain. 
Stress is the illness of the twenty-first century. 
However, you are offered now neither one nor two ways to combat daily exhaustion and the struggle in taking a proper distance from the work's dimension, 
but no more no less than 1001 ways. 
Beyond yoga positions, the classic massage or the "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a "menu" full of options tailored to individual tastes and needs. 
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 ways to relax" and will be available in the libraries thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK publishers. 
If someone believes winning the peace in areas such as business or personal relationships is not possible, this "manual" denies that belief. 
It also suggests alternatives, such as staying in touch with nature, or provides 100% natural recipes that help to relax. 
If the adrenaline is not already flowing in your veins to produce the balance of the body and stress has become a major problem for you, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
