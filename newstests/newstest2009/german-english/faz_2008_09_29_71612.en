Duesseldorf Hopes Rest in Frankfurt 
In a letter from the WestLB board of directors to the bank's employees, grand talk is not in short supply. 
Combining units of the Duesseldorf institution with Frankfurt's Deka Bank, the notice made public on Monday claims, could `create a major capital-market institution of the Sparkassen Finanzgruppe.' 
WestLB would contribute to the deal a `bloc of expertise' with sustained earning power, it says. 
Generally, the letter suggests, this kind of jointer might provide the pivotal impulse for further concentration in the area of the German state banks, the Landesbanken. 
That's what it sounds like when a board of directors wants to demonstrate being on top of things in difficult times. 
The flagging WestLB is still exposed to tremendous pressure, after all. 
Not just from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision, which only recently warned the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there was an urgent need for a solution. 
But talks of some type of jointer between Deka Bank, which savings bank clients are familiar with due to its investment funds, and WestLB have been making the rounds for some time now - even in Frankfurt. 
Presenting the report on the first two quarters in late August, Deka Bank head Franz Waas said a fusion between the institute on Mainzer Landstrasse and a Landesbank, such as Hesse and Thuringia's Helaba or WestLB, made little sense to him. 
But the administrative board of Deka, which is owned in equal parts by the Landesbanken and the savings banks associations, has asked the board of directors to commence talks with WestLB on joint business ventures. 
The possible subject is the capital-market business, or parts of it. 
Of course, as sources in the financial community point out, negotiations have only just begun. 
It's not the first time that the name Deka Bank - with its staff of 3000 one of the more significant employers in the financial center of Frankfurt - crops up in the context of a savings banks consolidation. 
In 2003, a merger of Deka Bank with Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba briefly seemed to be within the realm of possibility. 
But in the end, the threesome didn't happen. 
As soon as the plans became public, the Hessian state government spoke out against the participation of Helaba. 
The two remaining institutions also proved unable to reach an agreement. 
Instead, Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate was bought by Stuttgart's Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg. 
But deliberations on a jointer between Deka Bank and Landesbanken have continued to rear their heads. 
Most recently, Guenther Merl, chairman of the board at Helaba, had quelled considerations of a merger with his institution. 
This aside, there seems to be an increasing awareness that a consolidation of the various institutions in the public sector is imperative. 
First up, now that the state elections in Bavaria are over, a jointer between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg may have become more likely. 
For Helaba, that's not necessarily good news. 
Should the pressure for more mergers increase, it will by degrees be running out of potential partners. 
In the South, it would merely be a junior partner, although it has to date weathered the financial crisis much better than the institutions in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A merger with WestLB, in turn, was squashed early this year by the Savings Bank Association of Hesse and Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba. 
Remains only NordLB. 
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the equation. 
On the other stands the question in how far the institutions' different business models are compatible with another. 
In June, Merl said that the key issue of finding an appropriate business model to ensure the sustainability of the Landesbanken had not yet been resolved by the German Savings Bank Association. 
Ultimately, WestLB might also be split up, although, of course, that's not a solution favored at WestLB. 
The letter from its board of directors, accordingly, voices the manifest desire for a `comprehensive solution.' 
Quite how this is reconcilable with a jointer between individual units of WestLB and Deka Bank remains to be seen.
