Charest placed on the North 
The prime minister does not exclude calling for an election before the end of the year 
Once the general council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest yesterday visited Jean-Talon, Quebec City, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to get elected in the by-election today. 
"Pushing the limits of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining within the broad outline of the term of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Levis yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, a kind of mill of images was projected. 
Rotating in a loop on three huge screens, were dramatic pictures of hydroelectric dams, mining developments, of Quebec seen through "Google Maps", maps, etc. 
Like the mass media during elections. 
Moreover, as a point to emphasise, the Prime Minister has refused to exclude that he might call elections this fall, although he pointed out that his schedule was very busy. 
The "North Plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the object of a presentation. 
The Prime Minister had however to explain why the North was "a jewel with an immense potential", but never given its due chance, investment money, or specific priority in future projects. 
At most, a few avenues that could be further developed: including hydropower, the forest, but most of the entire mining sector, boosted by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds", according to Mr. Charest's list. 
This territory is twice the size of France", " it is here with us, it is in Quebec. 
Not only is it with us, but it's also us", he insisted, to better show this he solicited a national founding myth. 
The province has built much by its relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James's Bay. 
"We, our future," he added after a theatrical pause contemplating the immense map behind him. 
The North, 70% of Quebec, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed", said the Prime Minister at the press briefing. 
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated. 
There is a border along which there has been no agreement for too long a time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position there on behalf of government", he said. 
Moreover, "with the climate changes, we must rethink our vision of the North", he declared, referring to the Northwest Passage, to be held open throughout the year due to melting ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit? 
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with regard to them and that the project would benefit them, especially to young people. 
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member Ungava PQ), have already started consultations with thirty communities. 
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoit Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place, started work. 
The Prime Minister has not excluded holding a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a time when "we give ourselves a common vision." 
Northern development would also be consistent with the principles of sustainable development. 
The North will be "coordinated, orderly and respectful of the environment", he promised. 
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuous with that of the Liberal prime minister who preceded him. 
"As the Liberals who have preceded us, we have alternatively thought to transform challenges into opportunities for growth and development." 
This has been one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was launched Friday by a grand cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party. 
One of the resolutions proposed to rename the Central Beauharnois Dam in Adélard-Godbout. 
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay, our party has managed to forge the future", declared Jean Charest. 
In the press briefing, he invoked another reference, conservative as this, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
Addressing the proposed hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest has stressed that it should become operational for 2012. 
"Between us, but I plan to be there," he told activists, eliciting from them a huge round of applause. 
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of calling an election this fall, it is what the law permits him. 
He stressed that his schedule is filled up, notably by a mission to the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit. 
The weekend's General Council provided the Liberal leader a platform containing the nationalists resolutions, notably some "constitutional aspirations" which passed through like a breeze: the PLQ in particular calls for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec in the Constitution. 
It also wants Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications and that they have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec. 
On the opposition side, the outline of the Northern Plan was received with scepticism. 
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, has brought up again the policy development of Northern Quebec that the Landry government had launched in 2001. 
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came into power in 2003, had waived the application. 
Had it done so, "it would be more advanced today," commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (ballot which takes place today), Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ has supported the adoption of the North Plan by the government. 
"But what is desired, is that it is not just for show", said the leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returned from vacation today.
