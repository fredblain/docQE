"This is a bad signal for the market, which saw the Congress failing to adopt a plan, "said Lindsey Piegża of FTN Financial. 
"This shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, fearing that a draft adopted in several days time can be "too late". 
"If the project is effectively dead (...) then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed (i.e. the U.S. central bank) and other central banks to manage the crisis which would further tighten the credit conditions", predicted Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight. 
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "each day that passes sees the fall of another financial institution" in the United States, emphasised Mrs Piegża. 
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities have organized the takeover of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup. 
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, pushing for emergency interventions by banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets face "not only a crisis in U.S., but a global crisis", added the analyst from FTN Financial.
