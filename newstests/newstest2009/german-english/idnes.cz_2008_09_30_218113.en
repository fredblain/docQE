Prague City Mass Transport to operate on chip for the first time on Wednesday 
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written into the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first travellers board the metro, trams and buses with an electronic coupon in their pockets instead of a paper ticket. 
The roughly one hundred thousand people in possession of their own chip card Opencard at this time can get this coupon. 
Travellers can buy a 30-day, 90-day and year-long coupon (which will be valid beginning on January 1, 2009) and at the same time have it added to their chip card at info centers and branches of the Transport Company at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka. 
Beginning yesterday, coupons can also be purchased over the Internet on the web pages of the Transport Company, www.dpp.cz. 
By the afternoon, more than four hundred customers had used the service. 
Those beginning to use Internet shopping can definitively forget about the vending windows in the metro stations, where up to now they have had to regularly stand in long lines for paper tickets. 
That is, they can buy the coupon over the Internet and it will be added to the Opencard at one of the thirteen branches of the City Library. 
"At these locations, there is a counter available for travellers with trained staff who will help interested people with their Internet purchase, and will also add the purchased coupon to their card," said the project's speaker, Martin Opatrný. 
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to add the electronic coupons to the Opencard at the self-service machines which have been set up in several vestibules of the metro. 
What do these self-service machines look like? 
They are red, resembling ticket validation machines, and travellers might have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them," Opatrný added. 
Coupon checked by self-service machine instead of driver 
Using the self-service machines, which will begin functioning tomorrow, is simple. 
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card, and the pre-paid card is automatically added to it. 
The electronic coupons are valid beginning tomorrow not only in the capital city, but in its surroundings as well. 
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines numbered 300 to 499, which are mainly used by inhabitants of Central Bohemian towns to travel into the capital city. 
"In trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, the conductors are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they can check the time and zone validity of the coupons," Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid, which creates the timetables of the Prague Mass Transport, explained the ticket-checking procedures. 
The suburban buses have card readers built into the cash register next to the driver's seat. 
Upon boarding, it is thus necessary to not only show the chip card to the driver, but in addition it is necessary to place the Opencard on the designated spot on the side of the cash register. 
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons recorded. 
"If the traveller needs to confirm the validity of the coupons recorded, there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver," Drápal added. 
Travelers who do not use suburban buses, and will not remember when the validity of a coupon ends, can head again for the self-service machines where the coupons are added to the card. 
Here the information on the validity of their documents will appear on the machine's screen.
