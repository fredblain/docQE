First virtual operator to arrive in Czechia this year. 
Maybe 
The mobile market in Czechia is quite advanced and local operators offer practically all the same services as their partners in Western Europe. 
In spite of this, there is something missing here - a virtual operator who would force the classic operators to lower their prices. 
It might be missing for a long time. 
We have already written many times on Mobil.cz about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe. 
This has also been confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Bureau, who called attention to the fact that the price of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the Union. 
Following the most recent steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of the roaming fees, a paradoxical situation may occur - text messages for some customers of Czech mobile operators will be cheaper from abroad than at home. 
How is it possible that the prices in Czechia remain so high in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competitors who would really like to enter into battle. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, after all, we have three mobile networks here and over 100% coverage. 
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to pretend that the Czech market is extremely competitive. 
This is often seconded by the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Bureau (CTB) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past has claimed several times that there is no room for another operator in Czechia. 
It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network no longer has much chance (for that matter, it would be very difficult to find frequencies). 
But there is one more opportunity - a virtual operator. 
It is precisely the entrance of the virtual operators on the mobile market that brought the significant lowering of prices, to which even the classic operators had to react. 
At the same time, even before the entrance on the market of aggressive competitors such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, voices similar to those here could be heard. 
But it has turned out that there is a place for such operators and they can be truly successful. 
For that matter, we don't have to go far to find examples. 
In February of this year, we informed you of the start of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland. 
Over the course of merely half a year, this operator was able to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator. 
At the same time, the financial group Penta, which owns, among others, U:fon, stands behind Mobilking. 
The advantage of the virtual operators is the opportunity to concentrate on a much more specific target group. 
In order to function effectively, they require many fewer customers than a classic operator does. 
That is, they do not carry the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In this way, virtual operators around the world usually profile themselves as low-cost - they offer inexpensive calling and text messages, which is often balanced out by a more limited offer of services, though. 
That's how, for example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain can offer text messaging for at least fifty percent less than its competitors. 
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a rather good move and a bet on a novel target group. 
That is, this operator is specifically oriented toward men. 
"Real men choose Mobilking - the operator that they like and can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which runs this virtual operator. 
It is hard to say if a concept similar to the one in Poland could catch on here. 
Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmented approach on which most virtual operators are founded. 
In addition, it's relatively saturated from the perspective of the offer of services." 
No chance in Czechia, say mobile operators 
It seems almost certain that if there is to be a virtual operator in Czechia, it won't be Mobilking. 
"We have been talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in Czechia don't look very hopeful. 
More likely, Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region," said Jana Studničková, speaker for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz. 
She also confirmed indirectly that the current mobile operators in Czechia are definitely not inclined toward this idea. 
Rather, on the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can so that no potential competitor comes into existence. 
For a longer period of time now, the GTS Novera group has made no secret of its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator, and in this way it would like to take another step in the direction of becoming a real competitor of Telefonica O2 in the area of corporate clientele. 
"We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only hardwire telecommunication services, but also mobile ones. 
The sooner, the better. 
We have held repeated negotiations on this possibility with all Czech mobile operators. 
We have already been able to make progress in the negotiations with some of them," said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps there are better times ahead. 
On the basis of unofficial information, it looks like we can expect the first virtual operator as early as the end of this year. 
In the meantime, however, its creation is accompanied by a wall of silence. 
"At this time, we do not think that there is space for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator. 
Compared to other markets, the Czech market is very specific. 
No subject has approached us thus far with a complex and serious project in this area," claimed Vlastimil Sršeň from the public relations department of Telefonica 02 in a statement for Mobil.cz. 
Other operators also refer to the specific nature of the Czech market. 
In a rare shared opinion with a statement by O2, T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová added: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous business project that it would be possible to build upon." 
And she added: "No virtual operator is likely to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year. 
At this moment, in order to be talking about such a short timeframe, we would already have to have a concrete agreement on the table." 
Vodafone is placing its attention more upon fulfilling the requirements of its own 3G license. 
Regarding this, Miroslav Čepický said: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, above all in the area of shared costs and infrastructure. 
From the perspective of the customers, we consider this to be the most beneficial. 
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner for the construction of a shared network for fast mobile Internet." 
Responsible authorities - buddy-buddy with operators 
The procedure of the mobile operators is easy to understand, the entrance of another operator would mean increased competition, it would lead to a decrease in prices and hence to a decrease in their profits. 
Why, then, make this entrance easy for such a competitor? 
The tug-of-war surrounding the creation of U:fon attests to the fact that when something is important to the operators, they are able to pull for the same team. 
Probably the greatest pressure on the Czech Telecommunication Office was during the time of the creation of U:fon by T-Mobile. 
Information publicly available from the Czech Telecommunication Office's web pages attests to this. 
But now this is a suitable argument for U:fon to not allow the entrance of the virtual operator. 
Regarding that matter, Martina Kemrová pointed out: "The competitive environment of the mobile market was also recently amplified by the entrance of the fourth mobile operator onto the market. 
Considering the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is evident that the entrance of another player would place higher demands on it and above all on its services." 
But considering this approach by the mobile operators, the lack of interest by the Czech regulatory organs is, in fact, startling. 
This means not only the attitude of the CTO, which unfortunately in Czechia - unlike in Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the authority to intervene in economic competition. 
This authority belongs to the Office for the Protection of Competition (OPC) exclusively. 
But this office has assumed its typical position on this whole issue. 
"The entrance of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the signing of a contract on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator. 
No such contract has ever been signed, because the supply of potential interested parties was most likely not sufficiently interesting for classic operators," claimed Kristián Chalupa from the external relations department of the OPC in his answer to our question. 
A statement formulated in that way by representatives of the operators probably won't surprise anyone. 
From the office that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, make sure that no one abuses his/her position on the market, it is more than serious. 
All the more so when Kristián Chalupa added: "In other countries, where virtual operators commonly function, we can observe that their entrance on the market contributed to the decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services." 
But evidently the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices are not among the interests of the OPC. 
In truth, the shocking element of the whole case is the almost fluid harmony between the three mobile operators that is implicit in their reactions. 
The question as to whether this is really just a coincidence arises entirely by itself. 
Just like the exact same price of gasoline at the gas stations is surely just the product of coincidence and the tough competitive battle. 
"The Office did not find any signs of actions violating the rules of competition, and thus has no reason to intervene in any way. 
None of the operators have a dominant position, and hence none of them have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market. 
The telecommunications regulator is most likely also lacking the instruments necessary to open the mobile market for the virtual operators," Chalupa claimed in his statement. 
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the disputed points. 
Of course, an analysis of the relevant markets does exist, conducted by CTO, according to which telecommunications are, from the perspective of competition, the only market. 
On such a market, none of the Czech operators then have a dominant position. 
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - in order to create a virtual operator, it is always necessary to gain the permission of the network operator. 
And the mobile operator - entirely logically - has a monopoly on its network. 
So in a certain segment, it must necessarily be dominant. 
But even if we did not consider this argument, for the OPC it could be at least alarming that the three mobile operators are proceeding in a strikingly similar manner. 
At the same time, complaints from a series of interested parties (including the GTS Novera company mentioned above) demonstrate that they are encountering very similar hurdles in their negotiations with all the operators. 
Placing the responsibility on the CTO is a rather common trick in telecommunications, through which the OPC can have nothing to do with the whole matter. 
We have already encountered it in several similar cases. 
Unfortunately, it was not possible to establish the extension of the CTO's authority to the area of competition in telecommunications in the recently approved amendment to the Telecommunications Act, even though many experts had expected that this would improve the situation. 
The representatives of the OPC must know this very well, but their interests are evidently elsewhere. 
It can be done when nobody's looking 
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are already several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed. 
These are companies which publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, which are only partially public. 
These are usually companies dealing with multilevel marketing. 
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile telephone services. 
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected individuals. 
The trick lies in the fact that, in relation to the operator, the company acts like a classic company client who orders a great amount of SIM cards. 
As a significant client, it then gets special price offers (and other types of offers). 
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such advance sales. 
"If the cases you are talking about were to occur, this could be a violation of the contract conditions, which we would investigate, and it could culminate in the termination of our cooperation with the given company," Martina Kemrová answered our question on this problem. 
But it is highly unlikely that activities like this would not be reported to the responsible people from the mobile operators. 
This could be a question of thousands of customers, above all in the case of the three companies mentioned above. 
But at the same time, none of the operators are opposed to such a procedure. 
Namely, they make considerable profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they do not present any sort of threat to them through their own official marketing. 
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to potential problems: "The law enables such speculation, nevertheless only an insignificant percentage of customers use the services of these companies. 
On top of that, they must accept that the SIM card in their telephone is not registered under their name, and thus they cannot use all of its features like the regular customers of the mobile operators can." 
This is precisely what should seem at least strange to the CTO. 
In addition, another question for the OPC arises. 
If the mobile operators are looking the other way concerning this procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator? 
It must be added that the OPC has rather considerable power to uncover such activities, and if it does not wish to, it does not have to be satisfied with operators' claims that they have no idea about any such thing and that their trading conditions prohibit it. 
When we won't be the most expensive 
As mentioned already several times in this article, the entrance of the virtual operators onto the mobile market was brought about by a notable drop in the prices of services. 
At the same time, classical operators have more or less tried to prevent the creation of virtual operators practically in all countries where they have been created. 
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small, too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
But in developed countries, the regulatory organs, which supported the interests not of the mobile operators, but of their customers, intervened at that very moment. 
Either through formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator, and others continued in its footsteps. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory organs have been tossing the whole case back and forth like a hot potato. 
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that the lack of clarity in competencies in these cases suits them very well. 
But let's not throw in the towel. 
If the behind-the-scenes information are correct and a virtual operator appears here soon, the Czech mobile market might be set in motion once again. 
If one of the operators permits the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for OPC to be able to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of further interested parties. 
And we might stop making calls that are more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
