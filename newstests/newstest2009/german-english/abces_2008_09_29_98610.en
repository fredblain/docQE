A van loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish skips a road block in Alava 
Ten to six in the morning. 
Traffic control by the Ertzaintza in the municipal district of Armiñón (Alava). 
The officials order the two occupants of a van to stop but they, instead, give to flee. 
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason for not stopping. 
The officers chase after them, are succeed in arresting one over two occupants. The man, 28 years old, is identified as A. A. J., as reported in a press release by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government. 
The arrested person is charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents. 
This occurred when some officials of the Alava Highway Police were conducting an audit of transports along the N-1, at the point which it crosses the district town of Armiñón. 
They were going to stop a van for inspection when the driver, breached of the orders, sharply accelerated and just skipped the road block. 
The officials chased the van until the vehicle stopped after a couple of miles on the edge of the road, and its two occupants flew into a wooded area. 
The Ertzaintza officials managed to arrest one of the fugitives and, after the inspection of the van – an Iveco Daily, seized 2178 kilograms of hashish. 
The blocks of hashish, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for a deep investigation and detection of weight. 
Moreover, since officials found that the chassis number had been "duplicated" because it did not coincide with the one reported in the van's documentation, the arrested man was also charged for public documents' falsification. 
The Ertzaintza is continuing its investigations to arrest the second suspected person who managed to flee as mentioned above, and to determine the origin of seized drugs. 
The prisoner, A. A. J., 28 years old, was conducted to the police station to perform the appropriate procedures. He will be available to the court in the coming hours.
