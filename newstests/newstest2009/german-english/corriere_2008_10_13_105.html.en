Drugs: Never with fruit juices. 
Be careful of grapefruit juice, orange juice, and apple juice. 
These drinks, especially consumed in summer because they are thirst quenching and rich in vitamins, if taken together with some lifesaving drugs may alter their absorption, amplifying or diminishing, depending on the case, their efficiency with consequences that may also be serious for health. 
Confirming the risks associated with the assumption of fruit juices whether they are pre-packaged or fresh with certain medicines is David Bailey, professor at the university of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia launches a new warning: a glass of grapefruit juice, orange juice, or apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain lifesaving drugs, nullifying their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients. 
Grapefruit juice has already been accused because it was thought to be responsible for raising, up to levels thought to be toxic, the effects of some antirhythmic, antibiotic, tranquilising, antihistaminic, and neurological medicines. 
DRUGS AT RISK – The very same Italian Drug Agency had given the same advice in an information bill two years ago, alerting doctors and patients to not underestimate the dangers deriving from this mix and to pay attention as to what is drunk in cases when drugs are taken such as for example Diazepam or Methadone. 
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT JUICE – According to experts even orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs. 
The list of active principles inhibited by grapefruit and other fruit juices is very long. 
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the State University of Milan:"Usually, such discoveries are immediately brought to the attention of the various international and national drug agencies that then change the information slips of medicines. 
Therefore, always read the explanatory notes of the medicines taken and if there is something that is not clear, do not be afraid to ask the doctor or chemist for clarifications» emphasised the expert from the Ansa Agency.
