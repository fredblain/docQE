Fears for Afghan anti-polio drive 
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan missed out on a recent polio immunisation drive because of violence linked to the Taleban, the UN says. 
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week. 
But it says it could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons. 
A UN spokesman said this was despite pledges from the Taleban that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of staff carrying out the vaccinations.
