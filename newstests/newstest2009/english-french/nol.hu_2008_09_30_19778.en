Lukashenko-Opposition: 110-0 
No opposition representative was elected to the Belarusian parliament during the Sunday's election. 
According to Russian observers, the reasons for this are the welfare and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, while Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) explains it as vote counting frauds. 
OSCE delegating 450 observers from 43 countries refuses to recognize the election. 
Although the 100 member legislation of the country of 10 million has been missing opposition for more than a decade, before the election yesterday joined forces of the opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (UDF) had seriously expected that Lukashenko, who renewed his presidency for the fourth time during the controversial elections in 2006 after the amendments of the constitution, was going to "allow" presence of some opposition representatives in the parliament this time. 
Based on this, UDF desisted from the formerly considered boycott, too. 
The background of the expectations of the opposition was that the economically increasingly Russia-dependent Belarus - that had raised a loan to reduce the more and more expensive Russian gas import and agreed to Beltransgas owning gas pipelines crossing the country becoming Russian property - wished to improve its relations with the EU, where visa is not granted for Lukashenko and for a number of top politicians due to the Belarusian political system, which is considered anti-democratic. 
The fact that OSCE when having evaluated the election campaign rather focused on positive changes instead of deficiencies - like banning one third of the opposition candidates from taking part in the elections - indicated d√©tente formerly. 
However, OESC's Monday minute sheet raised objections against the campaign during which opposition candidates were practically not allowed to appear in the media and especially opposition not being permitted to be present at the counting of votes. 
According to the opposition, improvement is still perceptible in the political system: political prisoners have been discharged and Minsk is inclined to confront with Moscow in a minor way by still not recognizing South Ossetia and Abkhazia which have seceded from Georgia, although Russia - forming a federal state with Belarus on paper - has already been considering the two territories independent for a month. 
"We have taken two steps ahead and one backwards, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started", told Alexander Milinkevich to our paper. 
According to the opposition candidate of the presidential election of 2006, this dialogue needs to be maintained in spite of the fact that the "power has got afraid of allowing even one opposition member to enter the parliament of no weight". 
Seeing the results, the opposition does not plan protesting actions, rather aims to reach voters with its message about the importance of economic reforms. 
"We have much trouble with this of course, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, distribution is hindered by the local authorities, but I can still see that changes are favoured by more and more people, amongst the old, too", said Milinkevich referring to the fact that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the establishment of the social security as its most important result, is considered inappropriate even by pensioners who are officially most supported class of society of all. 
"Owing to the indebtedness of the country and the increase of trade deficit, the break-down of social security 'similar to dead silence' is a question of time", Milinkevich claimed. 
Russian observers described the elections as democratic, in contradiction to the opposition politician. 
Commonwealth of Independent States mission leader Sergei Lebedev told Russian news agency, Ria Novosti: "People believe in actions not words", so the lack of opposition is nothing else than the evidence of Belarusian voters' maturity.
