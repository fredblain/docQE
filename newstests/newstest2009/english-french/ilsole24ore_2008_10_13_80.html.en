Open Office, here is the third edition of the"anti-MicrosoftÂ» package. 
Today sees the release of Openoffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite which aims at gaining more users, from domestic to home users, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative for the better known Microsoft Office. 
After a effort lasting for almost a year on behalf of volunteer developers, with SUN Microsystem supervising at their backs, the new Open Office is revealed to the general public with various novelties: to the welcome screen and to a revisited, less Spartan user interface, are added others more substantial such as native compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO version standard. 
Attention was also placed on interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is capable of opening documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). 
Interesting are some functions specific to some modules such as the one that allows for the reduction in size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them via email, or the possibility of importing a PDF file into the graphics module, maintaining the original appearance of the page. 
Always on the same track, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents, that join the standard graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor. 
Collaboration is one of the features within the applications that has been considerably improved: in the spreadsheet application several users can operate simultaneously, avoiding conflicts on the modifications, in the word processor, each users is assigned a commenting colour to improve recognition during revision. 
Some companies are also working on porting some of the functionalities of OpenOffice onto the Web (on the cloud), and during the next few weeks they should release the definitive product. 
The Italian version is available for download at the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version which has been available on mirror sites since Friday. 
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system. 
On request the installation cd can be sent to your home or workplace. 
And if the gimmick of free could be a driving force for the diffusion into houses, it is in the business setting that Open Office is trying the big bet since it can already count on several projects realised within the public administration and schools. 
And there are even institutions that offer training services, consultancy, and assistance, ideal small to medium enterprises, which could create more business opportunities. 
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for onscreen typing corresponding to Word; Calc, the spreadsheet application aiming at substituting Excel; Impress, for presentations in emulation of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access is the application that consents working on databases; Draw, is the graphic module. 
The aim for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and considering that up till today we are at almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is probable that the predicted figure could even be exceeded.
