Sarkozy meets angry fishermen. 
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to make a trip to Brittany. 
Facing the display of force by the fishermen who on Monday had badly disturbed the access to several ports in Brittany and Normandy, on Tuesday morning at Guilvinec port, in Finistère, the president of the Republic has decided to yield and to meet their representatives. 
The latter have promised to accept "with a constructive spirit" and they hope he "will arrive with practical proposals". 
A presidential visit which occurs at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by fishermen in Brittany to come up with measures of addressing the soaring prices of oil, which peaked at an average of more than 1.14 Euro per litre. 
According to the Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be devised to help their enterprise to recover competitiveness and secure employment conditions and sailors' remuneration" 
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen. 
On Tuesday morning, they conducted slow driving operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams for almost 10 km. 
The leisure craft harbour of Quiberon was also blocked, but the roads to Belle-Isle were not blocked. 
A filtering roadblock was set up on the Quiberon peninsula. 
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, since dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at the port of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc. 
The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and on the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained docked at the quayside or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked any movement of any merchant ships. 
Fishermen in La Turballe and Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, in the evening stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery at Donges. 
Those at Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until after the meeting at the ministry on Wednesday to decide on possible actions. 
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" has to decide on Tuesday whether to comply with the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris. 
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Committee of Fisheries, which did not support their movement. 
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up" and "do not want to have to move onto Paris", for example, announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient. 
Professional fishermen, who pay no taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but believe that the threshold of profitability for a vessel is achieved with diesel fuel prices less than 0.30 Euro per litre .
