In Mexico, and without her peep-toes" 
In line with the British punctuality, at 17.40 pm, perfectly on schedule, the Spanish airline landed at the presidential hangar of Benito Ju√°rez airport in Mexico City, bringing there the Prices of Asturias. 
The sunset was almost done but the sun's rays still forced you to use your hand as a visor to see the royal couple getting off the plane. 
The Spanish ambassador and other authorities stood at the foot of the ladder. 
A few hours before I had asked a taxi driver, along the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were about visiting the city to formalize an official travel. 
- Ah, very good, so we cannot go to the airport and collect people in that time band... Is she from here or... 
- No, no sir, she is Spanish, but lived in your country for a couple of years. 
- Ah, well... 
On the way round, the Mexican press perfectly knows who are the princes of Asturias and is aware of the importance of the travel. 
Many are those who wait for them at the airport's hangar, crowded together on the red carpet and closed to a military line composed by 27 navy soldiers offering the honour greeting. 
The prince appears smiling, with a navy blue dress, and she, the princess, hair in the wind, very sober, does not wear her "peep-toes" as usual. Perhaps she had been reported Mexico City is threatened by bad weather. 
They give photographers a smile and a brief stopover before moving to the room where the official group is looking forward to them. 
By the door of the hotel where they're going to stay, one of the biggest four in the city, a funny reporter of Mexican television waits for them.
