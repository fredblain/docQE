Does it hurt less if you believe in God? 
According to a recent research, religious belief can be used as a kind of pain killer, which could have eased the death of catholic martyrs as well. 
"The scientists of Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment about the influence of believing in God on the degree of people's sensitivity to pain", says the British Telegraph. 
Within the framework of this highly bizarre experiment 12 catholic believers and 12 atheists were given electric shock. In the meanwhile, all of them were studying a painting of Virgin Mary. 
The results showed that the practising Catholics were able to exclude most of their pain. 
Due to the brain scanning technology, it turned out that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation. 
This was the first experiment in a series of research, which besides academicians includes scientists, philosophers, theologians from different departments of the university. 
To be exact, a sparking object providing electric shock was attached to the left hand of the volunteers in the experiment. 
The researchers asked the experimental subjects to thoroughly study two paintings; Sassoferrato's Virgin Mary from the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine from the 15th century. 
The researchers expected that - seeing the picture of Virgin Mary - the believers would enter a sort of religious state of mind. Da Vinci's painting was selected because of its similar style and calming nature. 
The volunteers spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and received 20 electric shocks within four consecutive time periods, while they were looking at one of the above-mentioned paintings. 
The Catholics described the situation as "safe" and "protecting" which made them "relaxed and peaceful". 
12 percent less pain was reported while the experimental subjects were studying the religious painting - comparing to the feeling they experienced by the sight of Leonardo's work. 
According to psychologist Miguel Farias, taking part in the experiment himself, similar effect could be produced by any kind of painting having strong emotional influence on the certain person, even among atheists. It is all about finding the right picture. 
"We should find a photo of someone who they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father", says the psychologist. 
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings of the research. 
"Practising faith should change and often does change our personality", he added. 
After these great results the question now is how Leonardo's or another highly appreciated painter's picture of Madonna would influence the believers' pain regulation? 
Would the sight of a quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?
