The Nobel Prize for Economy to Paul Krugman 
The Nobel Prize for Economy goes to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on market models and on the localisation of economic activities. 
55 year old Krugman is a neo-Keynesian that teaches at Princeton University and he is a well-known leader writer of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the major critics of the choices made in economy and foreign policy made by the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, in the days when Enron was going bankrupt, Krugman had forecasted in an editorial published on the New York Times that the second incident would have been more determining than the first, in terms of its consequences on the history of the United States. 
A prediction that started a fair number of disputes and that for years had been thrown in the economist's face, but has now been revealed to have been exact. 
«I am surprised and also a bit annoyed by the speed with which recollections of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from public attention», declared Krugman towards the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an"economist of great value», but also an orator with a"very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses in liberalism of the Bush administration».
