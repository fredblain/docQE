In brief â€“ Kovalev's victorious aim 
The Canadian number one trio is ready for the season. 
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack for a Canadian win of 3-2 in a shootout against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre. 
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec has raised two aides, and Kovalev has collected a pass in this win, the Habs' fourth in six preparatory games. 
Kovalev gained the victory by scoring the only goal of the shootout. 
"I am not yet ready, warned the Russian. 
I need another match to feel at ease." 
"He tried to do too much in the first period, Guy Carbonneau noted. 
But I think he appreciated the way the match ended. 
He had a nice ovation."
