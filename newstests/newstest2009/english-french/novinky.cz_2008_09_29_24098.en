Olmert would return nearly all occupied territories in exchange for peace 
The prime minister of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, expressed his opinion in favour of the restitution of practically all territories occupied in 1967, that is, even Transjordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and with Syria. 
He did this in an interview which was printed by the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth on Monday. 
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return nearly all of the (occupied) territories, if not all of them," Olmert told the newspaper. 
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similar percentage (of Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because there will be no peace if we don't do that," he added. 
He admitted that the possible restitution would also include East Jerusalem. 
"Whoever wants to be safe in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his or her legs, like what happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and tens injured. 
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mount, a sacred and historic place", which lies inside the Old City. 
"Whoever will want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs. 
That won't work," he stressed further. 
Leaving Golan Heights 
Olmert also expressed his opinion in favour of the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which according to him is an essential condition for entering into a peace agreement with Syria. 
But that would also require certain effort from Damascus. 
"I am not proposing to agree on peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan Heights," he warned. 
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to gain the Golan Heights. 
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship to the (Shi-ite movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the ongoing support they provide to the terrorism of the (Shi-ite movement) Hamas, (the terrorist network) Al-Qaeda and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq," the prime minister specified.
