Letters - A country dishonoured 
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice" (oh irony) in the Harper cabinet, which allowed himself last summer to say that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada. 
Thus casting opprobrium on the woman who led a struggle for justice and who deserves our admiration also speaks volumes about the entourage of the Prime Minister and on Stephen Harper himself. 
Here, we have before us a government that is the only one among all western countries involved, not to have repatriated its nationals locked in the concentration camp at Guantanamo. 
A government which ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the crimes for which he is charged. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, has gone back on his word and let languish in inhumane conditions a child soldier. 
The only one that relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Remember, for the record, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, pleaded for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he receives a fair trial in Canada. 
This same government turns a blind eye to torture: little does it matter to it that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, doubtlessly forever, after so many years of abuses. 
One does not yet realise, but we are witnessing right now a creeping erosion of our rights, of our liberties, and our "democracy", this word that Harper continues to brandish and that sounds hollow in his mouth. 
Now comes the time when there are no more morals: one can bully, torture, arbitrarily detain a Canadian citizen at the whim of the head of a minor government so far (so what will happen so after 14 October ...). 
A number of voters believe they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law, and Order: they do not see that this government has abandoned what was the reputation and dignity of our country. 
Shame, Mr. Toews, it is here, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
