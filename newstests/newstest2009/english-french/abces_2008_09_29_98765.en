We like America a bit less without Paul Newman 
"Sometimes God creates perfect people. 
Paul Newman was one of those." 
The sentence is by Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the feeling of American cinema's impotence, and throughout America, facing the shock that Newman has gone. 
And awarding him with an Oscar had been quite hard. 
And in 2007 he had retired. 
And people also knew he was very ill. 
Although this, it was a very hard blow for all. 
"Sometimes your feelings go far beyond any word, and now I lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country improved quite a lot thanks to his existence." 
No one was afraid of result ridiculous or exaggerate. 
A father of the cinema and of the country had died in a particularly dark period, with the fear of terrorists and markets, with American people's self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking new reasons to feel worthy.

For all people he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth. 
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and a supporter of lost and won causes, starting from the foundation to fight drugs he created in honour of the firstborn who died of overdoses until the promotion of a new brand for home-made and organic food.

Another English man, Sam Mendes, a director who won the Oscar, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the highest peak of his career. 
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, arrived to define Paul Newman as his biggest inspiration. 
"He left an example of the highest level for all of us," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who try to live today as Paul Newman did: maintaining in high consideration the need for rectitude and having a serious private life, away from the cameras. 
This is not always easy or possible in contemporary media jungle.

After the divorce, his second marriage with Joanne Woodward lasted fifty years long, and he remained faithful having certainly opportunities for not being so. 
"Why am I going out to have my hamburgers, when I can have a good steak at home?" used to joke himself. 
In the sky he is accompanied by the pride of his daughters who are also his fans on the earth, something not so common in America. 
"Of all the major roles he interpreted, none he was so proud of than that of devoted husband, loving father, attentive grandfather and passionate philanthropist" they say.
