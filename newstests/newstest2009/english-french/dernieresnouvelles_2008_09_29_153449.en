Illhaeusern... finally 
Illhaeusern has finally regained its path to victory on its own soil after a long period of draught. 
Without playing a great match, the Yellow and Black have created the most occasions and managed to turn one of these into the match winner. 
The rhythm was not very steady during the match and the attackers found it hard to express themselves. 
After a first attempt by the guest captain Kauffmann who narrowly missed the goal from a far shot, Illhaeusern went on to take a slight lead and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn from high, Romain with the tip of his foot or again Diebold came to tickle the Dannemarie defence. 
At the front, there was a midfield block that allowed just the centre forward Riahi at the forefront of the attack. 
The beginning of the second half was decisive with the first two occasions dominated by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, immediately after the score was opened for Illhaeuserns by Marais, well positioned to pick up a ball bounced off an initial attempt by Diebold (53'). 
But the Illhaeusern striker did not enjoy his success for long and was forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later, leaving his team-mates numerically inferior. 
But Dannemarie could not profit and could not cause any major problems to the Illhaeusern Eleven who just fell back a little to make its defence more "compact", except in the very last few seconds of the game where, after a big mess, the ball went very near the crosspiece.
