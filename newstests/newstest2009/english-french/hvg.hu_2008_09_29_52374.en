The psychology of overbidding: what do we spend more money on? 
At an auction, the customers tend to spend more money on a product and overvalue it. 
The neurologist and economist researchers of New York University managed to disclose the neurological-economic basis of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behaviour. 
According to their study published in the periodical called Science, people don not want to lose in a competition like the auction of eBay, thus they rather pay an unrealistically high price. 
The research aimed at mapping the neurological scheme of this "game" with the help of experimental auctions. 
A group of volunteers was playing lottery and another group was taking part in an auction. In the meanwhile, the active brain area of the experimental persons was being examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 
The participants had the chance to gain money in both games but during the auction game - in which overbidding the other person plays a significant role - the complex called striatum, situated under the cerebral cortex, was coming into operation upon the person's defeat. 
This area of the brain - besides its other functions - plays role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system. 
Thus, according to the researchers, raising the price can be explained by the avoidance of the violent reaction of the striatum. 
In order to justify their theory, the economist members of the research group conducted financial researches as well. 
In this research three groups were making bids against someone, under various conditions. 
The control group was simply informed about the real value of the certain product and they made their bids. 
Another group got a promise of receiving an extra amount of 15 dollars in case of their victory. 
The third group was provided by 15 dollars before the auction but in case of defeat, they would lose this amount. 
As it seems, the only difference between the two groups was the emphasis of victory or defeat. 
Proving the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group "playing for not losing money" were ready to make higher bids than the control group or the group "playing for gaining money". 
"These results cannot be deduced from any existing economic theory. 
The earlier theories explained the phenomenon experienced at auctions by the delight of victory and risk avoidance. 
It was the neurological imaging methods that helped us to dissolve the contradiction between the two theories in a way that we got to a third explanation at the end", said Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic faculty of New York University.
