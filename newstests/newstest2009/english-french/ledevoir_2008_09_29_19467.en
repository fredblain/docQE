Operation Save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree 
The Bush administration and leaders of Congress, both the Republicans and the Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s. 
The new version of the 700 billion U.S. dollars plan to curb the financial crisis that rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress. 
In particular, it foresees: a better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money committed, new provisions to limit the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to executives of companies rescued. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative to the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, following a marathon two-day negotiations. 
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market," declared the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been done in order to shield the real economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis on Wall Street," said the Democrat. 
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," declared Republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations turned into a sprint in the final hours for fear of the effect another failure would cause on the mood of investors. 
The deadline we had given was the opening of the markets this morning. 
Associated late to the negotiations, the two American presidential candidates were rather supportive to the agreement, without failing, however, to express their dissatisfaction that one is compelled to reach this extreme. 
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has asked for the addition of certain provisions in the agreement, particularly those that enable owners to keep their homes and ones on the wages of leaders of enterprises rescued by the state. 
"When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to congratulate. 
But these measures are necessary, "he commented on the airwaves of American television. 
Asked by another channel whether he will vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so." 
"The outline that I read [show] that this is something we will all have to digest and with which we can go forwards. 
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable", he said. 
The plan of 700 billion aims to buy with the money of taxpayers bad debts, assets at risk and unsellable U.S. financial institutions. 
It comes after a 14 month crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble which first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (subprime) before spreading to other forms of more widespread credit titles (PCAA) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and the stampede of banks and financial institutions. 
This is a group of elected Republicans who had derailed the first draft agreement last week. 
It is believed to have come out of this impasse ever since the Democrats have agreed that certain "toxic" shares of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased. 
To round off the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision has also been added stipulating that if the government had to take losses for five years because of this program, it could introduce new taxes to help recover its investment. 
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial tranche of 250 billion to which could be added another 100 billion if the President deems necessary. 
The other payment of 350 billion has to be endorsed by another vote of Congress. 
In exchange for its support, Washington will get stakes in the companies it has rescued, earning dividends in case of profits and that it can sell when the storm has passed. 
The federal government will be able to delay the proceedings on the seizure of housing attached to mortgage loans under this plan and to set limits to compensation and severance packages paid to executives of companies affected. 
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light. 
Voices have indeed continued to be raised against the project yesterday, both in the Republican camp as well as by the Democrats. 
"Obviously, Washington does not hear you," said while addressing his constituents the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Finance Committee of the House. 
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, solutions do exist. 
But not ones that take advantage of taxpayers". 
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed "the Sceptics' Caucus", the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but reaches the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to tell us: one asks the Congress not to hurry and to examine carefully the way forward", he said yesterday. 
At the same time, Europe has once again demonstrated the global nature of the crisis. 
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries have announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion Euro (16.3 billion U.S.). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas has indicated that it would renounce acquiring its rival in full bankruptcy since it has lost 2 billion Euro (2.9 billion U.S.) in the risky mortgages crisis in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
"This is not lost money, declared yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos. 
In return, we get the right to vote with the bank and some influence. 
It's just something that investors and households appreciate now that uncertain times are ahead." 
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government seems about to nationalize another bank hit by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government to endorse all outstanding loans in the bank Bradford and Bingley, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion U.S.) in real estate loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander has indicated yesterday that it will buy branches and customer accounts of the British bank. 
The Bradford and Bingley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, the British government will have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
