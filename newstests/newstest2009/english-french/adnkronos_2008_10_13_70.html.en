Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work " 
It has never happened in all the history of the Chigi Palace that there were revolving doors at the employee entrance and exit. 
But as from today, a new measure starts against crafty skivers, against those who clock in and then go to the bar for a coffee during working hours. 
The novel anti-slackers measure has been presented today by the Public Administration Minister, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Office of the President of the Council, Mauro Masi. 
"The revolving doors – says Brunetta – are a tool for working better, with a higher productivity, higher presence and more services" specifies the minister. 
"Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens. 
This is reformism", underlines again Brunetta. 
With the Chigi Palace, the installation in all the buildings of the Office of the President of the Council is complete. 
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic viewpoint". 
There has been no opposition from the employees, assures the Secretary General: "It has been a process shared by the workers and everybody collaborated". 
To conclude, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant. 
A word from Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at seven is blessed". 
During a convention at the High School of Public Administration 
of Rome, the minister, afterwards, makes known that "in three months the absences, by public employees, due to sickness have reduced by 50%, that is 60 thousand more people at work in a year". 
And adds that it is necessary to make Public Administration more efficient. 
Italians, "whose wage dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 8–10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and far above the inflation rate". 
Meantime thousands of public employees have united to challenge the provisions set by the Brunetta decree adhering to the petition supported by Codacons. 
"While the minister for Civil Service today parades the figures regarding the reduced absenteeism at work due to sickness – the consumers' association writes – the population of ‘the industrious skivers' is continuously increasing. 
In fact, in Italy there are thousands of honest and productive public administration employees that have united to declare war on the illegitimate provisions within the decree". 
In particular, at the TAR the exclusion of additional economic benefits for infirmity incurred during work will be contested; the extension of the hours that a sick employee has to make himself available for control medical visits, and other aspects within the new provisions insisted on by the minister.
