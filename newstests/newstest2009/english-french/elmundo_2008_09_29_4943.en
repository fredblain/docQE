Microsoft looks for a (virtual)receptionist 
During the conference on Emerging Technologies at the MIT, Microsoft presented a preview of the new recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without that much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as call a taxi (or, in the scenario described by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company's campus) "understanding" what happens in a standard conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a forms and faces' recognition system, this "receptionist" may know how many people are there in a specific room, who are they â€“ including remember what's their position - and listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them. 
It may also clustered people in groups of conversation. 
The demo showed that the receptionist notes a third person, understands he does not belong to the group he is talking with and that he is not a company's employee. 
It asks him if he's there to visit someone and says it will attend him as soon as possible. 
This without any awful blue screen. 
Awesome. 
But this is the future, of course. 
Now the company needs to focus on many other issues, such as the next Windows operating system's release. 
This week it was a big talk on Microsoft's change of strategy. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not be charged with so many programs. 
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers are equipped with the essential functions and less commercial rubbish, these should be five times faster - hey! Steve, will be for less. 
A real discovery, if one takes into account the fact that Microsoft, version after version has only added features and "extras" to Windows. 
The change of direction is very welcome. 
Microsoft is right: the operating system will be increasingly losing importance, and the software with it. 
When Google launched Chrome, I was one of those who supported the theory this was the first step Google made to compete with Windows. 
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system. 
The operating system will be always a necessity because it is the essential element through which hardware and software can communicate. 
It performs the same function of your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law. 
It's true. 
It won't ever disappear, perhaps you just need to think about the "death" of the operating system as a relative event rather than as an absolute one. 
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea. 
People give less attention to the operating system, and increasingly focus on the browser. 
They only use the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - daily and spend a longer time browsing the web rather than working in a window environment. 
What half of the operating system's applications are there for? 
Less is more. 
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista. 
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex. 
A Microsoft more interested in integrating its online services should constitute a viable alternative to Google. 
Actually, they desperately need it. Let's take a little example. 
I shot the photo of this post during the Microsoft employees' break, in Redmond, earlier this month. 
A sign, hanging on the soft drinks' machine suggested them to use the company's search engine - "Your search. Our Future". 
In 2006, an independent study reached the conclusion that the 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search on the net. 
Last week, moreover, Microsoft confirmed the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not be launched on the market at the beginning of 2009, but even at the end, maybe in 2010. 
Microsoft surely will try a joint launch, Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together. 
Our phones, at the very end, is increasingly becoming a computer. 
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on marketing, will result detrimental.
