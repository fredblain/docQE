Hamburg SV 1, Borussia Moenchengladbach 0 
With one goal and simple measures, Hamburg SV conquers the top of the chart. 
At Borussia, Luhukay remains unable to find a working team.

The Gladbach player joined the game late and missed, lifting the ball to the crossbar. 
His message was concisely phrased and left his throat convincingly. 
He simply knew that he was right. 
`We need the second goal,' Hermann Rieger hissed in the hallway at Hamburg Arena. 
Not a lot was going on in the `catacombs.' The half-time break was over and most people had returned to their seats. 
Rieger was HSV's physiotherapist for nearly three decades. He is held in higher esteem than some other lapsed actors. 
And thus, his plea was heard by the powers that be. 
Assistant Coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement. 
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's Coach-in-Chief, Martin Jol. 
The latter's order is likely to have been a similar one: Get me goal number two! 
It was never executed. 
`Not everything was fun to look at today,' Marcell Jansen later admitted. 
Bastian Reinhardt would also have `wished' for things to be `more relaxed.' 
Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric for scoring the 1-0 (1-0) with his header (11th); and the fact that a very weak Gladbach team proved unable to hit the weak Hamburg team where it hurts. 
`It was a dirty victory,' Martin Jol summed things up. 
This Monday, Hamburg SV turns 121 years old. 
Spectators began celebrating on Saturday evening - themselves, the blue sky above the Arena and the instant chart on the video screen that showed their club as top of the class. 
It's going to be a birthday without a real party. 
`We know where to file this one,' said Marcell Jansen. 
He senses that the chart's intermediate report says more about the unpredictability of the Liga than about the dominance of his HSV. 
The team and its belatedly signed-on new members - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goal-getter Petric, as well as Jansen, who was wooed away from FC Bayern - are slowly finding their form, but they are not shining brightly yet. 
`We need more style and more dribbling,' Jol demanded.
