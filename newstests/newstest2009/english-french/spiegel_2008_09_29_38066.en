UEFA President Platini: Reprieve for Poland and Ukraine 
Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Ivan Vasyunik said that preparations would soon be transferred to the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister. 
`The government considers UEFA's decision a display of trust in Ukraine and its ability to host the Eurocup together with Poland,' Vasyunik said. 
`This is no amnesty for our country. 
Work has only just begun, and there is much still to be done in both countries.' 
The two hosts are behind on the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports. 
Even a reduction of the number of Euro stadiums from eight to six is possible. 
`We cannot waste any more time. 
We have to proceed at great speed now,' said Grigoriy Surkis, president of the Ukrainian soccer association. 
`UEFA will be keeping an eye on us constantly.' 
An even more radical measure was taken in Poland. 
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki. 
The commission had been assembled at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslav Drzeviecki. 
There was `the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules,' Drzeviecki told Polish news agency PAP. 
`We have reassured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the Euro 2012 will not suffer because of this.' 
In the past season alone, several major-league teams had been convicted for manipulation and sentenced to a forced relegation. Ultimately, even the beginning of the season had to be postponed on short notice.
