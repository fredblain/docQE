Prague Stock Market falls to minus by the end of the trading day 
After a sharp drop in the morning, the Prague Stock Market corrected its losses. 
Transactions with stocks from the Czech Energy Enterprise (ÄŒEZ) reached nearly half of the regular daily trading. 
The Prague Stock Market immediately continued its fall from Monday at the beginning of Tuesday's trading, when it dropped by nearly six percent. 
This time the fall in stocks on Wall Street is responsible for the drop. 
The reaction of the market to the results of the vote in the American House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan for the stabilization of the financial sector there, has manifested itself here as well. 
Stocks fall in Asia 
Stocks in the Asian markets experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, even though the indexes ultimately erased a part of the losses during the day. 
The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange wrote off nearly four percent during the day, but later it erased a part of the losses and reduced the decrease to roughly 2.5 percent. 
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the stock market in Hong Kong, dropped by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed. 
Stocks on the market in Sydney lost more than five percent, but ultimately lowered their losses to 4.3 percent. 
The stock exchange in Taiwan dropped by 3.6 percent according to the local index. 
"The timing of the bailout action in the USA is uncertain and it will influence financial markets all over the world," remarked the head of the Hong Kong Currency Board, Joseph Yam. 
Despite the fact that it is a part of China, Hong Kong determines its currency policy separately, that is, without being dependent on the Chinese Central Bank. 
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States. 
American legislators should quickly return to their negotiations and approve the bill to support the financial system, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. 
Otherwise there reputedly looms the threat that other countries will also feel the impacts. 
American stock bloodbath 
On Monday the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, into which up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 billion Czech crowns) was to be invested. 
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's appeal for them to support the plan. 
According to Bush, the plan would tackle the basic causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy. 
American stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday and the major stock indexes registered their greatest fall in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones Index dropped by nearly seven percent, having registered a similarly-ranged fall the last time in 1987. 
The index had dropped even prior to the vote, but as soon as it was revealed that the bill had not passed in the House, the index went into free fall.
