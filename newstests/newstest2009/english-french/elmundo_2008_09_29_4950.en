The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid 
Yes, the dream of many of us is that one day Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt in 2012, this could happen in 2016. 
But I wonder, are we ready? 
If we follow the example of yesterday race, I just say no! 
They called it the "perfect race" but in my opinion it was by far the worst I witnessed. 
All a nonsense, that if taken into account during the evaluation and I had to examine it, the output would be totally negative. 
But let's go with order and start from the very beginning. 
The nonsense began with the collection of the back number, which presupposed you went there before the race. 
It did not seem a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, it should be to withdraw all things (including the chip to avoid queues during the race). 
But this was not. 
We went there just to collect the back number (first nonsense, just go for this only reason) and (after the queue), surprise! they only had "S" size T-shirts (second nonsense, because I need an XL). 
What kind of world are we living in? 
Is it to blame the crisis if they bought only small T-shirts, made with smaller tissue and therefore less expensive? 
Well, these things were nothing if compared with the day of the race. 
We had to go very early to collect the chip but the queue was 15 minutes long and, furthermore, you had to deposit your backpack. 
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where you expect more than 11,000 people. 
Then, as expected, the race started when we had not even handed over the backpack, although, once succeeded, the recovery was even worse. 
In addition, the rain threatened the waiting longer than 40 minutes, which went along with a kind of popular rebellion and an attempted assault to stand. 
I believe we will be around 500 people surely with pneumonia tomorrow, and some, like me, not even resulted in the proper arrival order because of the chip, which, I suppose, did not record the arrival time properly. 
In future, if I will be asked for the perfect race, this one wont't certainly enter in my thoughts. 
At the end of the day, I think we will continue to dream of an Olympic and well prepared city.
