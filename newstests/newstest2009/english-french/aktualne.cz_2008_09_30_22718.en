Questions after accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal? 
Law doesn't know them, walking in coach bus not permitted 
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question has arisen as to whether stewards and passengers can move around the bus while it is in motion. 
"If we would like to strictly and formally uphold the law, the activities of the steward are in conflict with the Traffic Law," says speaker for the Ministry of Transportation Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, during which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week, was evidently caused by the driver of the truck that crossed into the path of the bus. 
Unluckily, at that moment, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the vehicle, even though there are two more seats reserved for her. 
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply even when the steward is handing out coffee or newspapers. 
The question of whether the bus is equipped with standing room in accordance with its registration plays a role. 
If this is not approved in the bus, the passengers must sit. 
The Student Agency coach buses do not have standing room; which the head of the company, Radim Jančura, also confirmed for Aktuálně.cz. 
"We tried to find a solution to this with the ministry, and initially they did not permit the movement of the passengers. 
Eventually they revoked this and we reached the conclusion that the passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their own seat," he conveyed his position. 
The law does not know the steward 
"There is no straightforward legal interpretation of the steward - no legal enactments deal with this role. 
However, nor do any legal enactments prohibit the transporters from providing services. 
The Traffic Law only knows the term vehicle conductor; it does not define the rights and responsibilities of that person," speaker Hanzelka added less unambiguously. 
The head of the Department of Motor Vehicle Operation of the Ministry of Transportation, Josef Pokorný, on the contrary, said that the law treats this issue sufficiently. 
"It depends on whether the bus has standing room permitted in its certification. 
That's all there is to it," he says. 
Buses are divided into the categories of city bus, where there is standing room and limited maximum speed, inter-city buses with standing room and a higher maximum speed permitted, and coach buses, with no standing room and the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts. 
Like in an airplane, says expert 
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert on traffic safety for the National Strategy for Traffic Safety (BESIP), does not see any essential problem in the movement of stewards on the buses. 
"During a smooth ride, there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service in airplanes. 
Even there it is not certain when turbulence will occur and the stewardess can hit her head." 
"However, if the bus were to brake sharply, of course, the laws of physics are valid. 
Just like in a city bus or a tram. 
The transport provider must deal with the safety of the stewards through internal regulations," he says, and he also thinks that from the legal perspective, this issue is unresolved. 
Jančura willing to discontinue services 
Student Agency is the only bus transport provider to offer the steward service. 
It employs nearly two hundred of them. 
Even after the accident, the head does not consider their job to be risky. 
"But as soon as I gain the impression that the stewards' job is risky, I will discontinue them. 
Passengers can get coffee and newspapers when boarding. 
It would also save costs," he says. 
Alexej Litvin, head of Asiana, which operates a fraction of the bus lines that SA does, explained the absence of stewards in his vehicles as due to safety interests. 
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been against it from the very beginning. 
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he told Týden.cz nearly a year ago. 
Enormous tragedy occurred 
A young stewardess from the Pilsen area, who had worked for the company for two years, died in an accident on the bus line to Naples. 
A Slovenian tractor trailer truck likely left the emergency lane without signalling and blocked the path of the bus. 
The bus driver tried to avoid it using a sharp manoeuvre, however, the front right part of the bus grazed it. 
Jančura rebuffs the claim that the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest had been sold out. 
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in the coach buses, they are blocked." 
The company plans to sue the driver of the truck. 
The agency will not wait for the court verdict to compensate the girl's family, but it expects financial compensation from the guilty party. 
Adaptation of the law? 
Far away 
An adaptation of the law, on which a thirty-member expert group from the Ministry of Transportation has been working for over a year, could bring about the specification of the movement of stewards on board the buses. 
"But no concrete conclusion has been reached. 
They are not dealing with buses much, it is more the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of cell phones while driving," says expert Hořín. 
"The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that would threaten the safety of the passengers in any essential way," concludes speaker Hanzelka, adding that the enforcement of safety in buses is under the jurisdiction of the police and the Labor Safety Office.
