Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, is asked to introduce herself on her first day at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to giggle: The German girl is totally `kawaii'! 
What this means? 
Sylvana is familiar with the term from reading manga - in her new exchange log she tells about Japan. 
`First day at school in Japan. 
I was so excited. 
The way to school alone gave me the jitters. 
I live at the edge of Tokyo, towards Kawasaki, and the train ride to Tachibana High School is 40 minutes. 
I had to find the way on my own, and luckily I didn't get lost. 
The beginning of class isn't organized as strictly as back home in Lower Saxony. 
Students begin trickling in at eight o'clock, until a brief conference with the teacher, the `home room,' starts at 8:40. 
But before class began, it was my turn to introduce myself. 
I'm not someone who likes to talk in front of other people, mind you, let alone a class of 40. 
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I was dressed in one of my host mother's old skirts, as well as a blouse, blue stockings and black leather shoes. 
In this attire, I stood before the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is a week from now. 
At that moment, I was very glad that I'd been learning the language for two years already. 
The 31 girls in class were all whispering and giggling among themselves and waving at me, and I kept hearing the word `kawaii.' 
I already knew it from my manga. 
It's part of the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls and means `cute,' `sweet.' 
Then I scurried to my seat. 
The girl beside me was smiling rather brightly. She thought it was an honor that the exchange student should be seated next to her. 
The rest of class was pretty uneventful, but when the bell rang, they were all practically crowding me. 
They were talking all at once and giggled and bombarded me with one question after another, even though Japanese English is really hard to understand. 
Then, during the break, everybody got out their bentos. 
My host mother had prepared such a lunch box for me, too - it's something else than the bleak German lunch break sandwiches. 
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad made from cucumber and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in a tofu coat. 
Most of the time I don't have the first clue what I'm eating here in Japan. 
The stuff looks weird and has a completely novel taste. 
I can say this: It's all delicious. 
Well, except for the salty plums in oil, that is. Yeuch! 
At Japanese schools, the bentos aren't just lunch. 
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a homemade bento that she's fixed in a particularly fancy way to a boy, in the hope of getting to know him better during lunch break. 
I read about that in my manga. 
I'm looking forward to finding out whether that's happening here, too. 
`Why Japan, of all places?,' my girlfriends asked when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year. 
And I always told them: 
`Because it happens to fascinate me.' 
After all, manga have been my favorite reading material for years. 
And in order to have a better understanding of the comics and the culture in them, I eventually started to learn a little Japanese, as well. 
So for me it's been a no-brainer that I would have to come here eventually. 
Because I also have a penchant for tradition, manners and customs. 
And those are considered very important here. 
On the one hand, Japan is the land of the latest technologies and trends, but on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well-organized, I haven't felt lost yet, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen.
