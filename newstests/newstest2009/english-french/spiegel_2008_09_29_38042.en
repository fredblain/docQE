Flight and Hotel Rates Drop 
In the first half-year of 2008, flights and rooms in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year. 
In Germany, flight rates even dropped by as much as 50 percent, a current survey says. 
Rates for flights and hotel rooms have dropped again, according to a survey by travel and financial services provider American Express. 
Analyzing its booking data from the first half-year of 2008, the company found that, after an increase of rates in the first quarter, there was a significant drop in the second quarter. 
Following years of increasing rates in the hotel market, rooms have already become cheaper in many places. 
From January to March, rates in 41 out of 48 analyzed European cities were still increasing by an average 6.9 percent compared to 2007. 
But from April to June, rates had already dropped by 3.6 percent versus the previous year. 
The trend was most visible in Paris and Rome, the survey says, where travelers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year ago. 
American Express considers the weak dollar to be the reason for this, as it results in a `decreasing desire for travel among American tourists.' 
Financial centers like Frankfurt and London were hit harder by the dropping hotel rates than industry locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger, it further says. 
With an increase of 26.3 percent, hotel rates in the Norwegian city are holding the record for Europe, even. 
Flight rates were also still trending up in the first quarter. 
Due to the increasing cost of kerosene, economy-class travelers had to pay 7.1 percent more on average than in 2007, while rates for more fuel-intensive long-range flights even went up by as much as 29.2 percent. 
From April to June, economy-class flight rates dropped by an average 12.5 percent versus the preceding quarter, whereas business- and first-class price changes were much less noticeable. 
In Germany, rates dropped even more sharply than in other European countries. 
From January to March, rates had increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they dropped by 23.6 percent. 
The rates of domestic German flights were halved even, a survey says. 
On the one hand, the sudden drop in rates was the result of the slowing economic growth, the company says. 
Demand was receding in many segments of the air-travel market, it says. 
On the other hand, there was an increase in competitive pressure through the Open Skies Agreement, which deregulates air travel between the U.S. and Europe. 
Among the signs of increasing tension were the cancelation of unprofitable routes at airlines, it says, as well as the high number of airlines filing for bankruptcy in the first half-year of 2008 - in Europe alone, it was 24 airlines, it says.
