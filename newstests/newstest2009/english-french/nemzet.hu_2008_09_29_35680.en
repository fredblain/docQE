Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty, segregation must be eliminated 
The European Equality Summit has been opened today in Paris, which is organized by France this year, representing the Presidency-in-office of the European Union. 
In her message that she addressed to the plenum, Lívia Járóka of Fidesz, Representative of the European People's Party called attention for the educational segregation since it is one of the most serious infringement affecting Roma children. Moreover, this is the largest barrier to their prosperity. 
The high level conference has been opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labor and Social Affairs and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities. 
Representatives of the governments, the European social partners and the most significant European legal aid organizations and NGOs from the field of equal opportunities were invited to have a seat on the conference. 
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group in the EP - pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination experienced when applying for a job, Roma people are segregated from the labour market mainly because of their low educational qualification. 
"Most of the young Roma people do not have a secondary school qualification, and due to the low quality of the basic education only an insignificant part of them can obtain college or university degree". 
Járóka also emphasized that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights. 
Investing in the early education of Roma children can contribute to strengthening the economy of the European Union member states. 
According to the representative, it is necessary to inform the widest range of people - Roma and non-Roma people as well - about these interrelationships. 
The earlier a young Roma student starts attending school, the bigger their chances will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through the income and the taxes paid by them they would contribute to the national budget. 
"On grounds of the citizenship right applied in the European Union, the right of quality education must be ensured for Roma people and low quality, segregated education must be eliminated", added Lívia Járóka. 
She also said that in order to instantly accelerate the processes of school desegregation, it is necessary to guarantee an objective- and action-oriented cooperation within the European Union. To accomplish this goal, it is fundamental to properly enforce the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives. 
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment must be eliminated, Roma children must be provided with the opportunities of democratic life so that they could contribute to the future of Europe as citizens with full rights", demanded Járóka. 
Within the framework of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", the European Equality Summit - first organized in Berlin last year and since then held on an annual basis - aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and anti-discrimination at European and member state level as well.
