MSS announces a protocol for finding obesity gene
Social Security directs a research to find the gene for obesity in children and young people; it is supported by specialists from the IPN
The Mexican Social Security Institute (MSSI) has announced that conducts a research to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, called the protocol of 'Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence', which will provide counting on markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of Specialties Hospital, XXI Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that it was integrated a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social workers.
The team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
The research invites the population entitled or not, to participate by going to the participant sport units of the MSSI in the Valley of Mexico, where there will be carried out the tests to children, every Saturday from 8:00 o'clock.
He stressed that the protocol started in the Cuauht√©moc sports unit (West Mexico State) and since October 8th, the activity takes place in the Netzahualcoyotl Sport unit (East State of Mexico).
Once reached the goal of bringing 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Independence Sport Unit (South the Mexico City) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (North the Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to understand the components and the importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and identify in children and young Mexicans the risk factors for preventing the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
On November 14th, there will be celebrated the World Diabetes Day, and the goal is to collect three thousand children and young people between 6 and 14 years, with the consent and parental supervision for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family hereditary history of disease, in order to avoid risk factors that give rise to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday to all participants will be applied anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and waist circumference), blood pressure measurements, and determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (seeking to identify genes that are associated to childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in children.
Health Surveys made between 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years there was an increase in the case of the boys, 77 percent were obese, and 47 percent in the case of the girls; in terms of overweight there was also observed a dramatic rise, "said the specialist of the MSSI.
He said the justification for searching the markers is based on that the population of the country differs from other in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has a 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that generally, the genetics of obesity result in the inability to burn off the excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children, which can detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthuses) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of suffering of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is handled with confidentiality, doctors deliver it in writing to the parents, to whom they explain each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle that have to be undertaken in order to prevent disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three major components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day and watching TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
Also it is due to the high caloric intake, meaning, and the increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrate (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein and genetics analyzed in this protocol.
