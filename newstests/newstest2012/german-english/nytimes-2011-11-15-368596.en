After an Earlier Misstep, a Minutely Planned Raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
The overnight hours of Monday into Tuesday were chosen because Zuccotti Park would be at its emptiest.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, with others initially being told that they were embarking on an exercise. 
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repeat of episodes in recent weeks, like the pepper-spraying of protesters, that violated department rules and created a firestorm of public sympathy for the squatters.
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters unfolded after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared by watching how occupations in other cities played out.
A major disaster drill was held on Randalls Island, with an eye toward Zuccotti.
Officials increased so-called disorder training - counterterrorism measures that involve moving large numbers of police officers quickly - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move into the park came down at the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the assignment only as "an exercise."
"The few cops that I know that were called into this thing, they were not told it was for going into Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
"The only people who were aware of them going into Zuccotti Park were at the very highest levels of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On Oct. 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then backed off as hundreds of protesters streamed in ahead of time after hearing of the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including boroughwide task forces - scores of mobile officers who are usually used to flood high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said many people, almost like commuters, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to move in.
"It was appropriate to do it when the smallest number of people were in the park," he said.
Emergency Service Unit trucks with klieg lights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving out.
The lights and prerecorded messages booming from the loudspeakers seemed to cow many protesters.
As the community affairs officers moved into the park in their light-blue windbreakers, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, giving the protesters time to gather their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to move in if arrests were needed in the park.
Reporters in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said it was for their safety.
But many journalists said that they had been prevented from seeing the police take action in the park, and that they had been roughly handled by officers.
Mr. Browne said television camera trucks on Church Street, along the park's western border, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense tangle of protesters" personal belongings, including luggage and plastic lawn and leaf bags stuffed with clothing, crews from the Sanitation Department followed, scooping up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, the images appearing on the Internet soon after.
A core group of protesters took up positions close to the encampment's kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police moved in to methodically arrest them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the encampment locked themselves together by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service officers were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "disorderly conduct and resisting arrest," he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of department, the top uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, was "not directing operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of officers waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to move in.
Barricades were set up at Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and at Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, the police were seen expanding the perimeter even farther outward from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, several officers, many with shields, were seen pushing people farther out.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the rowdiest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, one protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen releasing the air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood came flying from the crowd.
In the end, one officer and one protester were hospitalized.
