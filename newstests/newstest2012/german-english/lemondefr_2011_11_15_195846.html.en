CDU intends to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig took place without any real problems arising for the Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also President of the Christian Democratic party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned to be on the programme, but imposed itself in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who will be watching the government's policy on Greece today and perhaps that on Italy tomorrow....
The motion on the preidency of the European Commission, tabled by the directorate, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained from voting.
The standing ovation lasting several minutes which they, Angela Merkel and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, received at the end of their respective speeches, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and of the motion, is embodied in the slogan "the right response to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the Euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has arrived for a breakthrough in Europe ."
This could mean modifications of the Treaty of Lisbon, making it possible to strengthen the control by the European Union of the budgetary policies of the countries of the Eurozone, but this could also affect the election of the president of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to impart a face to Europe."
This is, generally speaking, the case of one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress, whose inspiration clearly comes from Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is not probable that the Twenty-Seven will rapidly agree to this solution; Great Britain is opposed to it and the heads of CDU think that Nicolas Sarkozy is also opposed to it.
But the marker is in place.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the vote of each country-Member of the directorate of the European Central Bank according the size of its economy, which would clearly increase the weight of the German economy.
Anxious to calm the climate in her party, the Chancellor increased the number of her references to Konrad Adenauer and to Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence the congress on the back of the "small" European countries, or of countries in difficulty, which are quick to criticise "arrogant" Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except when in a hole.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
