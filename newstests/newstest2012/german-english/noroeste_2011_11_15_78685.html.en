There must be made contributions to works
The social works referred to in the programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk not to be completed or to have serious delays due to the lack of funds, said Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although so far the work programs have advanced they are at risk because the State Government failed to make the contributions that correspond, which represent a resource superior to 11 million pesos in all three programs.
He noted that the total investment in these three programs is of nearly 50 million pesos, of which the State has to contribute with 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so the possible delay in the completion of these is in force.
"They have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a dime, since starting with July they had to give us a part," he said, "in order not to delay we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions it had to make, so that at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to borrow money in order to cover more than 7 million, a sum that was not provided on that occasion by the state administration.
"It happened to us in the previous administration because the State did not have the financial capacity to participate and the programs continued advancing, and this year in order to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending," he explained.
Although there is a commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he said that the request was made ​​to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to speed up the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them to come as quickly as possible.
"They have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a dime."
