Moleskine, a brand card.
Created fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine will restore the taste of writing.
It is a scent of adventure, of hours sent in writing by a the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognised, by its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its broken white pages, as if aged over time.
Nevertheless, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a designer notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant of the company, has assumed responsibility for the launch of the new product.
The notebook draws its inspiration from an old production technique, the mole skin which means varnished cotton used for covering benches, for example.
This type of notebook is said to be highly prized by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has been updated to meet current taste for an old and forgotten object, which was an avantgarde artists' icon up to the XXth century," related Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the manager of the brand name at Modo Modo.
Success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 25% to reach 12.7 million units.
One has travelled far from the production of the first years, when only 3000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine is crossing the Italian frontiers and is exporting to 70 countries, from France to the USA.
It is difficult to establish a profile of the typical purchaser, because the notebook attracts equally a businessman, a student and a professional.
Moleskine consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had only 12 employees at the start, now has almost 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
Its distributes its notebooks to Fnac libraries, small shops in town centres and has succeeded in becoming well known.
"We followed the spirit of the times and this need for new means of writing, notwithstanding the rise of e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine; recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, it also launched a leopardskin pattern cover on the occasion of the Film Festival in Locarno.
Exploiting its success and the cultural aura, Moleskine diversified its products to include handbags, pens, computer bags. The brand includes every kind of support.
A success, which aroused envy; in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, to write a new page in the history of Moleskine.
