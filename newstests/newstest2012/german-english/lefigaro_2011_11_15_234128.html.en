The terrorist front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is disquieted by links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspected for a long time, the links between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian deputy foreign minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algiers is now certain.
"The manner in which the two organisations operate and the reports of secret services show that there is a lot of cooperation, he explained without elaborating.
Paris appears to make a similar analysis.
The inquiry into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January discovered two bridges.
The men kidnapped men in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqui, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory had to be killed on the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by special French forces.
Among the rubble left behind by the action, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of calls exchanged indicates several interlocutors based in Mali, in Niger and in Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers interest the investigators in particular; one leads to a Nigerian who lived for a long time in Maiduguri, a town in Northern Nigeria,the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man said to be close to Aqmi and to the sect.
"This is an advance, but it is undoubtedly necessary to await more exact proofs before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it is possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect benefits from outside financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active, says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support became more and more evident from the developments and statements by Boko Haram and from its methods of operation, which increasingly include resort to kamikazes and to increasingly complex explosive engines of the same type as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, is now exerting pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems caused by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities have in fact long considered the group to be a community of enlightened persons not worthy of interest.
Rapid success
Founded in 2002 at Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and a fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa "with Western education" is a criminal, who promotes the installation of an islamic emirate in the Moslem north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is enjoying rapid success.
It is politicised and demands rigid respect of sharia, whilst its militants engage in a struggle with the impious central government.
The latter target primarily churches, bars and administrations.
In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram showed themselves particularly active, multiplying attacks on police establishments.
The reaction of Abuja is, as usual, without light and shade.
The army surrounds a town and leaves 800 dead behind.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect will become radicalised and will leave its northern fiefs.
Last Christmas it claimed an attack, which left 80 dead at Jos and then more at Abuja.
In June at Abuja, Boko Haram takes a secured police QG during a suicide attack,its first.
In August, the local United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will move from Mauritania to Somalia via Nigeria, now disquiets all security specialists.
Now that Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger and the Somalis of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new menace in the continent.
Last week during an interview in Nigeria with president Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and declared himself ready to share all intelligence.
