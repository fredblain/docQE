Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation headed by the Uruguayan President Jos√© Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin this Tuesday a visit to Mexico in order to expand trade between the two countries and to approach political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday his Mexican equal, Felipe Calderon, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the schedule released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between both presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "favorable for the exchange of information as regards the political issues between the two nations," as published the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to the local media, Mujica seeks to get Calderon's support for Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when the French President Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that caused the refusal of Uruguay and the call to consultation of its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico presides since November, the G20, a group composed of the world's most powerful developed and emerging countries, and has in effect with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has attempted in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax exchanging arrangements in order to leave the "gray list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), composed of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
On the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between both countries.
