Athens feeds back the doubts
Papademos said that adjustments will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk subsidies launched and uncertainty reinstated in the parks, Greece is still entangled in the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consent" of the new transitional government of Hellene comes imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of political forces began to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papademos warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in his appointment may be underestimated for applying them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, ensured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled on February 19th.
"The main task of this Government is implementing the decisions of the summit of October 26th," Papademos said yesterday when opening a parliamentary debate that it will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not clear the doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we are not committed to anything."
The Conservative leader was one step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the entities that must unfreeze the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needed, and made ​​clear he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still having a nappy rash by the impact caused by the all or nothing statement of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is clear: it will not unlock the help if the new Government and the leaders of Hellene major parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and this as soon as possible."
The Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, said the troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what has to be done to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although there is no definite date.
The Greek hank still has a thread for the moment.
