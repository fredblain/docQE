A Stylist Must Also Be a Good Psychologist, Professionals Claim
In the opening article on stylist training, I was complaining a bit about the amount of information in the introductory lessons.
I had no idea what was coming.
Lectures by three experts from the field; dressing tips for difficult figures; and a seminar on how it works in practise.
And more is yet to come.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really packed with information.
This time, together with Alenka, the Director, (there is not a single man in the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not in perfect symmetry.
A majority of women are not perfectly symmetrical.
One has a short neck, the other has a boyish figure without proper curves, yet another is overweight.
A stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, make the neck look longer, or add the curves necessary.
We were given tips on how to accentuate the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, i.e. with bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist, and not to dress them too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers do not fit, it is worth to have at least one piece custom-made.
You will definitely not regret the investment, as perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
In a custom-made skirt, you will feel much better than in one that keeps shifting, rolling up, sticking out in your waist, etc.
Boyish figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with ruffling, appliqué, embroidery, or shirring.
Given the abundance of such information and figure types, I am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my head.
Still, I fear it is too much, with regard to the homework we were given.
Each of the course participants was given a celebrity to create two outfits for: day and night.
We must consider their current appearance, their fashion style, and figure type.
I am to dress Miranda Kerr whom you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
Inside I rejoice, as she is so much easier to dress than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about a ton (please, understand I am exaggerating), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We must cut the clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet and print and graphically process them.
Moodboard, as the result is called, then expresses our personal style and attitude to graphic depiction.
It is important to think about the graphic part of styling.
A stylist does not just dress physical people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on specific instructions, for example, trendy purses, coats, etc.).
This is what a stylist and designer, Mario Kameník, was telling us about.
But that was not until Sunday.
A stylist needs general knowledge
Saturday's lecture, filled with information on figure types, was livened up by three guests from the field.
A stylist, Honza Pokorný; a fashion designer, Jakub Polanka; and a fashion photographer, Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and a stylist should be able to use this fact.
A good stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in different ways.
In this case, variability is key.
For example, a trench coat may be worn in the standard way, over jeans and T-shirt, as a coat; but it may also be worn on naked body, with step-ins, as a dress.
Another option is rolling up the sleeves or collar, and the entire look changes completely.
"Play with it," he emphasised.
However, I appreciated the following advice the most: "For your work, you need to know the rules perfectly."
'Then you can start breaking them,' Jakub told us.
Here I finally understood why we drill all the definitions and rules of what to combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see something else.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that a stylist must have more outfit versions prepared than the number he is to take pictures of.
So, for a ten-page fashion story (equals ten outfits), I have to be ready to create at least fifteen of them.
Now I also know that in the picture, a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality.
We must therefore take that into consideration when creating an outfit.
Honza Pokorný confirmed that image and style often are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is no miraculous singer, yet her image and marketing turned her into a worldwide star.
The attitude towards stylist services is still rather cold in the Czech Republic.
Even famous people often consider it redundant (believing it is sufficient to be good at something, and how they look at it comes second).
And if someone finally lets us create their styling, then we should expect them to give us different (smaller) size than what they really wear.
Then, we are left to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote something about a celebrity gaining/losing weight, etc.
On Sunday, both Honza and Mario were stressing the fact that for a stylist it is not enough to know about fashion and be able to create an outfit.
Our work chiefly consists of communicating with people we dress; it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to estimate people, not to pander, and stick to one's opinion.
"If a manager asks you to go through her clothes and add some nice pieces, you cannot throw out her entire wardrobe telling her how awful the clothes are."
"Find at least a few pieces you can praise, and recommend what to wear them with" Mario says.
He also showed us what specifically a duty bag must contain.
That is the bag you fasten around your waist to carry all the props you need.
Aside from the obvious things, such as scissors, a sticky roller, or safety pins, it should have a nylon thread (for the stylist to use when taking pictures of products such as purses or hats), special clip-ons for holding the clothes in the back in case it is too large (pins and similar things are forbidden as they damage the clothes), or a sewing set.
To have some change from listening, and gain some practical experience, we learned how to properly underlay shoe soles.
Even when taking photographs in a studio where the surface is even, the soles might get damaged - not to mention shooting outside.
And so we were sticking away.
You must not touch the shoes with the scissors, to avoid any damage.
This requires real skill.
Mario pleased me by praising my job.
The skills mentioned are really not my cup of tea.
This is just a fragment of what we heard during the second weekend course session.
I am beginning to realise that to be a professional stylist is no piece of cake, no matter what people say.
