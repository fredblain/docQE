V Need for Speed: The Run takes place across America.
Review
An originally carefree ride turned into a routine morning drive to work because of a series of completely superfluous and sloppy mistakes.
The ambitions were met to a certain point, but it does not matter since nobody obviously wanted to do any extra work.
Before it was released, the new version subtitled The Run created high expectations.
It promised to shift the old Need For Speed racing series in a new direction; the demos made it look like a game that might stand up in the action racing genre.
We were curious to see the sections where the main character gets out of the car and runs.
Typical for the NFS series though, in the end many things are different from what we expected.
The game represents a possibly decent arcade race, but the whole is burdened by several unnecessary mistakes featured in the series for a number of years.
This means they are not really mistakes, but the expression of an incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure opens very well.
You are introduced into a story, where the main character, Jack, decides to solve some personal issues by participating in an illegal race across America.
You get in the car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to be the first one to reach New York.
The idea brings several interesting features.
The route is divided into ten stages, subdivided into over fifty races.
This means each race takes place on a different route, and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments.
One thus does not feel the game keeps offering the same things.
Despite the graphics being on the same level of previous parts of the series, some of the environments are very nice to look at.
Still, it is nothing world-shattering.
Driving through the desert, autumnal countryside, or high in snow-covered mountains is visually very pleasant though.
In addition, the races are, from time to time, enlivened by an untypical feature.
For example, in the desert, you get into a sandstorm, significantly decreasing the visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to get under an avalanche.
Individual races are ordered fairly well.
There are just a few types, but it is sufficient.
For a while, you try to overtake a number of competitors (basically a regular race); then you try to beat the time (standard stopwatch race); or you are in a duel with a single rival.
On top of everything else you sometimes come across the police who make your efforts more difficult.
The parts outside the car are new.
They are just interactive animations, where most of the time Jack is running away from someone and you need to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
Nothing difficult.
It is a surprise though, that these parts are much less in number than you would expect (just three to be precise).
It actually turns out to be good for the game, because this feature does not get to be boring; within what was already said, it is one of the things that make the game more entertaining.
The driving model follows the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that it is nothing special anymore, but it cannot be considered a negative.
If you are looking for a real-to-life simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
Still, this driving model is fully suitable for the action style racing, even though we could find better at the competition.
So far, everything is just right.
However, after some time, problems come.
In contrast with the driving model, the collision model is not that good.
From a game of this type, one does not expect complicated deformations and collisions, but when you have no idea, before crashing into any object, how your car will act, something is not right.
Typically, when overtaking or passing cars tightly in common traffic, you sometimes lightly touch the other car. Yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or, crashed completely.
This is not such a big deal due to the restart system, but is enough to spoil the fun.
The restarts are done so that if you crash or get far off the track, the game takes you back to the last interrupted point.
Nevertheless, there are only five restarts available per each race.
If you use them up, you have to start the race from the beginning.
This makes it an aid in case something does not work out, but you cannot rely on it completely.
Sometimes the restarts are not enough and you need to learn a given section of the race by heart.
A significant shortcoming of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns have to be driven through in a specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit in.
At other times you meet civilian cars at a given place in the very same configuration, no matter if you come first, fifth, five seconds earlier, or one minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you can see how your rival drives through the two cars coming in the opposite direction so easily, while when you get there, the cars are already positioned so that you have to either drive around or slow down.
It makes no difference when you get to them; everything is set so that the situation always occurs just in front of your nose.
The competitors have other advantages, too.
While playing the game, you find several places, where, regardless of time, the same competitor overtakes you at the very same spot.
This is most obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge, where you are driving in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your rival has to get in front of you no matter what.
The thing is that when he is driving in front of you, he makes your vision worse, which causes you to crash the car a few times in the section.
One can understand the attempt at making the game more interesting and adrenalin-filled, but it is so obvious it gets annoying quickly.
It's a pity, because despite the simple driving model, the game is entertaining and sometimes even so full of action you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you.
It is not important whether the reason you do not get bored is the concept with fifty unique tracks, ordering of races, or something else.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
You have to watch out for gas stations along the way, as that is where you car may change despite the fact that in most of the cases the one you have is fully sufficient.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; strong American cars for straight highway sections; and exotic supersports cars for technical driving, such as along crooked mountain tracks.
The key story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode; these are the races in individual locations you know from the story.
Here, you gain both medals and experience points for your profile, common for both challenges and the story.
Various features unlock fir getting a higher driver level: starting with cars and ending with profile backgrounds.
Again, the profile is interconnected with an on-line Autolog function, which, among other things, compares the results you have reached with those of other players, and ensures community functions.
Yet another setback difficult to understand; is the situation from the last race in the story.
You and your car get into a subway tunnel (let's say you do), where you speed down the tracks in the darkness (let's say you do).
Your speedometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's say it does), when suddenly, a subway train comes running down from behind you, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For several days, our editorial staff kept discussing whether when designing the game no one thought for a moment or whether its authors really think we are such morons.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary; but the overall visual impression is mostly pleasant, sometimes even great.
It is a pity though, that in some dramatic moments, the recording, in some cases rather tragically, decreases.
This especially concerns accidents with large number of participants, where fluent recoding would not help you much anyway.
The sound is all right; the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please the widest possible young audience, the soundtrack is 'flecked in from all quarters'; but there probably will not be many people buying the game because of its music.
Overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confused.
If the game avoided those clearly redundant mistakes, we could sincerely say that The Run is the best part of NFS for the past several years.
However, the game feels unfinished.
It surely is a nice entertainment, but prepare to be blinded by the mistakes with the strength of airport spotlights.
