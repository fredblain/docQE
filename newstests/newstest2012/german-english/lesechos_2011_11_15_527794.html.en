Yoshihoko Noda
threatens fresh intervention on the exchange market
The Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the exchanges market if the value of the yen continued to rise.
"We would intervene as we did the last time, if we found excessive volatility in the rate of exchange of the yen, explained M. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to near historical levels, causing the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that date, Tokyo sold the yen against the dollar on a massive scale in order to cut the value of the Japanese currency, which was setting a new record of strength since 1945.
But the yen had risen regularly since then, stimulated by purchases by investors who regard it as a "shelter" in these uncertain times of worldwide economic slowdown and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen and the Euro fell under the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to levels which triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was about 120 yen and the Euro over 160 yen.
This rise of the Japanese currency damages Japanese exports, because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the value of income of Japanese firms from abroad, when converted into the national currency.
"Japan is fighting to reconstruct itself " since the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the region of Tohoku (north-east), stressed M. Noda who fears that this rise of the yen does not kill the fragile embryonic recovery.
The world's third biggest economic power has resumed growth in the third quarter -1,5% compared with the previous quarter - for the first time for a year, thanks to a rise in exports and consumption of households affected by the catastrophe.
But the prime minister felt that the high price of the yen did to reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals ."
The minister of finance, Jun Azumi, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which on Tuesday opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take every necessary step to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken steps the "appropriate steps" stating that no additional monetary flexibility was to be expected on Wednesday
Since its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased by 5.000 million yen (47 thousand million Euro's) worth of treasury bond purchases, raising the ceiling to 55.000 thousand million yen (519 thousand million Euros), which it is devoting to the purchase of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
