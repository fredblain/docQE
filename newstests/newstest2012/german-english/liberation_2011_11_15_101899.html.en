Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
Immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from various aspects a congestion of police, legal and administrative services subjected to a policy of numbers and the compatibility of that policy with the self-proclaimed status of the country as the country of French human rights.
More recently, it is administrative harassment of foreign students, which is topical, with the minister of the interior ("Libération" on 23 May) declaring that France "does not need foreign talent, bricklayers and waiters."
But it is only rarely analysed from the economic viewpoint.
There is a lot of consensus between the Left and the Right on this subject.
On the Right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed would not become a problem in a country with 2 million of foreign workers," and on the Left by Michel Rocard explaining in 1990 that France "cannot accommodate all the world's misery."
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was felt both on the Left and on the Right.
Both sides see immigrants as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The only difference resides in the degree of generosity, which one deigns to grant to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to banalities, saying that co-development would allow our immigration problem to be solved."
This notion of immigration being a burden and a problem, may be an electoral asset, but it is economically very costly.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron, remind us in a recent book summarising the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, mai 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries, which admit immigrants.
Restraining immigration leads to anaemic growth and harms employment.
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they are liable to replace native workers, in particular unskilled ones, exerting downward pressure on wages.
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary to, rather than replacements of, local labour, exercising trades in which there is a shortage of local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors, which do not attract local labour and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, the complementarities existing between locals and immigrants bring it about that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the pay of locals.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a rise of 1% in the migratory flow causes an increase of between 0,6 and 0,9% in real long-term pay.
And does so without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth (a large proportion of naturalised immigrants are among American Nobel prizewinners, whilst Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
Th World Labour Organisation estimates that for example in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30, will make a net contribution (receipts less expenditure) of an average of 150,000 Euros to public budgets during his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished at the start of his mandate to look for missing points of growth "with the teeth."
The teeth in question, intended to serve to dissuade immigrants, had precisely the opposite effect.
