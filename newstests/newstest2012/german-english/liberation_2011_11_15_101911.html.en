Europe invented democracy, thinks in terms of European democracy
Democracy is a precious possession; it is also a fragile one.
The European continent should be able to remember that having invented it in Athens over two thousand years ago, it experienced during the XXth century the tragedies of the World War, of totalitarisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some believed that it was enough for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to do so as directly as possible.
It is known that since the time of Napoleon it was a matter of faculty of thinking.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the sine qua non of democracy, is not enough and can actually become a "tool of oppression" as once said the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No,democracy requires a lot more, a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, a separation and control of powers, education, the Lumieres, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis, which we are passing through, is an economic crisis, but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this respect, the palinode of a true-false Greek referendum will have a double revelatory value, that of a need of a powerful reversal of policy, but also that of the worrying sentiment of its impossibility and of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought through, in order that it can be bypassed.
The truth is that the lines of the forefront of democratic struggle have now moved, and that for many, the republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums organised as required and in a confused sequence.
The "free hand" of an absolute European monarch, or a jump with tied feet into the nationalist void; what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want the blades of a guillotine, but an exercise, joint, serene and ongoing, of choice and of democracy, this time on European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain or Portugal and one would not know where to stop enumerating them, because there is only a single crisis and that is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, which defers to the dictates of the markets and of rating agencies, who suffer from their incapacity and a lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe, which is humiliated on the international scene.
There is disquiet about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the entire Europe, which is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with its each of its nations.
The urgency concerns the return to popular sovereignty, the direction of the European project.
Because it is by all working together, that Europeans will be able reduce the weight of their individual debts, to free themselves from the markets and to prepare for the future by investing in it.
Emerging from the crisis will entail decisions on European level, which cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy without leading us into disaster.
After having long fought this proposal by specialists and of Jacques Delors, the whole world now calls for a European economic government.
Let is be so.
But the idea without stronger economic, political and democratic integration and lived in such by citizens, would be a fresh folly and a new impasse.
We must launch a new stage of European construction.
To establish the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The Revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must construct a Europe integrated on economic level.
This can only be done by constructing a more democratic Europe on political level, a real popular European sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
