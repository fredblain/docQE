Deutsche Bahn plans winter crisis package into the millions
Deutsche Bahn has come up with a crisis plan to prevent train cancellations in the winter.
The number of employees is to double.
The costs will run into the millions.
According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million Euros more this year in the battle to prevent winter-time cancellations and delays.
Referring to an internal crisis plan at Deutsche Bahn, the Bild newspaper has reported that investment of around 300 million Euros in total is planned up to 2015.
Investment is intended to improve the availability of locomotives and the rail network, even in the face of extreme weather conditions.
The number of internal and external employees involved in removing snow from rail facilities and platforms is to double to 16,000.
The aim is to clear platforms of snow and ice by start of business and 90 percent of the critical points within four to five hours.
RÃ¼diger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train cancellations and delays this winter at a summit with government and industry two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn had considerable difficulties in its passenger business, as it lacked reserves in the face of difficult weather conditions.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railway Office.
There is also some delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also been forced to have the axles of ICE trains checked significantly more frequently for many years, after an ICE train's axle broke in Cologne's main station.
