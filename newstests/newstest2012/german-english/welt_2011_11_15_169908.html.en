Warren Buffett pumps 10 billion into IBM
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company, IBM.
Since March, he has bought up shares totalling more than ten billion dollars.
Until now, the major American investor, Warren Buffett, had always claimed not to invest in IT and computing companies, as it was difficult to forecast the long-term development.
However, IBM's annual reports changed his mind on investing in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have realised much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
The IT veteran IBM has now earned the title of "Sir IBM."
Buffett revealed that he had purchased IBM shares totalling 10.7 billion dollars since March on the US business news broadcaster CNBC.
His investment holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has become one of the largest shareholders in IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM knew nothing of his involvement until recently.
He praised the management, which has managed to bring in profits even during the economic crisis.
"They have done a great job," said Buffett, referring to the management strategy.
For a fairly long time, IBM has focused on lucrative IT services such as data centres.
The computer pioneer - now more than 100 years old - also provides software and consultancy services, as well as powerful business computers.
Buffett had avoided technology firms to date.
He claimed only to invest in companies whose business he understands
and invested in a freight railway, for example, a lubricant manufacturer and a machine manufacturer.
His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns shares in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück) alongside around 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built it up, with clever investments, into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
His lifestyle, however, has remained humble,
making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible instinct for making money has earned him a nickname as the "Oracle from Omaha."
The IBM share price rose by one percent before the markets opened following the announcement of Buffett's investment.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also known, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world alongside Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, has said he is not planning to invest in Microsoft.
The founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend.
