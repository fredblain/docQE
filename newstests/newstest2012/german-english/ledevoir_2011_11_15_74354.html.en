It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, says a committee of experts
Canadians are living half dead, according to a report of the Royal Society of Canada
Regarding palliative medicine, the committee claims that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors work together to provide the best possible palliative care, apart from cancer cases.
Canadian society is half dead.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to speak with their doctor when they want to die and take steps to that end.
This is one the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts in different fields took part, including ethics, the law and medicine.
This committee recommends to the government to modify the criminal code, so as to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia when it is elected by a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, the experts cite a recent inquiry by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries worldwide.
Whilst Canada is placed 10th, the study notes that "the medicalisation of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to tackle the subject of death.
Medicalisation or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 86% of them end by dying in hospital
Countrywide, it is in Quebec that the rate is highest, with 86% of deaths taking place in hospital.
On the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report arrive at conclusions which oppose the position of the Federal government, which has already said that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Now, according to the experts who also reviewed the position of all countries where these actions have been legalised or decriminalised, there is no proof that the aid decriminalisation involves abuses of application, that is to say, the practice of euthanasia, or of assisted suicide on persons who are not competent, or not consenting.
On the contrary, affirmed during a teleconference, Jocelyn Downie, who submitted the report, more such cases were found precisely in those countries, where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalised.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia, because according to an Angus Reid enquiry in 2010, they believe that it would allow persons at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And the legalisation of euthanasia would not result in sending a message that the life of aged or handicapped persons had less value.
Regarding persons who commit assisted suicide, investigations indicate that 41% of such cases should not have been prosecuted.
Regarding the continuation, or the withdrawal of nursing care of a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
They also suggest among their other recommendations, that the penal code should state that legally valid withdrawal of nursing care is not criminal.
The committee of experts also requests that health professionals should be trained in the duty to respect a withdrawal of nursing care at the end of life without having to fear criminal prosecution.
Regarding palliative care, the committee calls on governments, nursing institutions, and doctors to work together to provide the best possible palliative care and not only in cases of cancer.
Lastly, concerning palliative sedation already widely used in Canadian health institutions,the committee asks that it should be considered where it only serves to reduce physical pain, as does euthanasia and that it should be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Certain experts in the field of the health-related legislation have already voiced reservations concerning the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada experts' report.
Ma√Ætre Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health legislation, described as "extreme" the position of the experts who signed the report, because among other things, it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to terminal cases.
"This opens the door on a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old, could ask for help to commit suicide, says Me Deschamps, who yesterday consulted a summary of the report.
Me Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report appear to place the independence of the person above all other values which contribute to the fabric of society
He says that "in society there are signposts and constraints.
The specialist in health legislation, Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition to the conclusions of the report, which she described as being "obviously pro-euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests, in particular, the data of the report concerning abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legalised as in The Netherlands and in Oregon.
