The court validates "digital television transition" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog with digital is one of the most important changes that has hit the world in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice (SCJ) rejected the constitutional controversies brought by the Senate and House of Representatives against the presidential decree that brings forward the so-called "digital television transition" from 2021 to 2015, since the eight votes needed to invalidate it were not obtained.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed his authority by issuing a decree detailing the actions to take in order to achieve the transition to the digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate, was rejected for not meeting the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The sentence project prepared by the Minister Olga S치nchez Cordero, proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree, because the regulation of radio and television materials is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve.
Only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S치nchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to contradict the decree, and to support the claims, the minister S치nchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions stipulated there regarding the digital transition.
At the ministers" meeting there was also decided to reject the claim filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of the minister S치nchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to get prepared.
"Nor do I consider that if made would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the guidance of the State.
The replacement of analog to digital is one of the most important changes that have hit the world in recent years, and results in a better utilization of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Delaying the change, he said, would mean delaying the benefits of digitization, which involves a public interest decision, which has not only a technical dimension, "as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he said, "require the operation of the entire system established under the principle of the state economic stewardship, comprises a group of powers which the Constitution leads to the state executive power."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world has now completed the digital transition, and has done it through the executive, despite of having highly specialized technical bodies.
There cannot be concluded that the government, by issuing the contested decree, that invades in any way the competence of the Congress, is providing in the administrative area the observation of the laws issued by the Legislature, he said.
