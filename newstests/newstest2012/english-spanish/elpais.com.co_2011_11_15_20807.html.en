What did the candidate of Valley lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Serna Melina Ramirez for not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley gets its title number 14 of princess.
Once again Cauca Valley remains with the desire of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with being on the winning podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and scepter, the department counts with 14 Princess titles and Melina joins the legion of women of Valley of Cauca who have been close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Aljure Garcés (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Now the big question many are asking is:
What was missing? Because the result is the defeat of a big favorite who in each performance showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain she was elected Queen of the Police and Best Jolie Face of Vogue, titles that were obtained by queens as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first key factor in the decision of the jury to designate her as First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question" 'What is the book that has marked you and why? Asked ​​by Martin Murillo Gomez from the Literary Cart Let's read.
To the questioner she answered
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it is a form of culturalization, and I definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is "The little Prince' is a pretty deep book.
Today I read "Crime and Punishment' it is a book of universal literature that we all should read; and now I'm reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The heat of blood.'
A response that the jury did not like due to the term "culturalization' and second of all for not specifically explaining how each of the cited books have marked her.
But after the ceremony Melina said she was calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise it happens what it has to happen."
And for you all, please read a little bit, 'The Little Prince' it is a great book "
Among the launched hypotheses it is said that Valley got burned by favoritism.
A reporter from Bogota suggested that for being the preferred, the acclaimed, and the candidate who received all preliminary awards (Oster food challenge, the public vote for the best traditional costume, and Mother Queen), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and therefore she did not shine on stage.
And that was noted in her first appearance in swimsuit on the beach of Hilton and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although in both she looked confident, it was noted that she lacked the strength and energy that Magdalena and Atlántico representatives did show.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program "Like home', of the RCN channel said that the fact that Melina was designated as princess "means that the candidate who more awards wins during the competition is not the queen."
In addition, Valley lately avoided talking to the press, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valley failed to convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
This is why, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were seeking a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the physical appearance and focus on social awareness, before entering the contest they must be already involved in projects," she said.
There is also a speculation that Valley sinned for her defects on the posterior and the fibrosis that could be seen on her abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury specifically chose her as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which for me was not very noticeable, made her lose points the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, of Cromos magazine considers that the error of the Valley of Cauca were the surgical interventions she suffered.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valley did not know how to do them.
Her body was never her strong advantage and here is where she was punished.
For this award, which for the first time is given by the National Beauty Contest, after the swimsuit parade a cruel prophecy was fulfilled last night, it was said that this was the flicker that Raymundo granted to Melina for not giving her the pleasure of taking the crown.
Reality or not, the fact is that Melina today begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions designated by the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens that despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, found difficulties in getting the crown.
