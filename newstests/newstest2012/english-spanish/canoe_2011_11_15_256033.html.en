A Russian scientist has assisted an Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, assisted Iran to develop a detonator usable with a nuclear weapon, confirmed on Monday an American agency specialising in the field of atomic hazard.
The Institute of Science of International Safety ISIS) bases itself on the recent report from the International Atomic Safety Agency (AIEA) and other documents from this UNO agency, to identify this researcher.
Last week, AIEA announced its serious disquiet concerning a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS drawing largely on AIEA documents, M. Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for 30 years from the 'sixties onward, in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk (Ural), and was involved in the manufacture by explosion of synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991 he left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated on an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, AIEA mentions "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a system of nuclear detonation "was aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who also informed the Agency that he had worked for most of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
