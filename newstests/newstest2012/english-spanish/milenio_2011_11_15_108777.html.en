They analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoac치n
According to the data transmitted by the PERP the difference between the first and second place in the gubernatorial election is of only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total of 6.074 minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality as regards the electoral process of this year in Michoac치n, where according to the data obtained from the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PERP) the difference between the first and the second place of the governor's election is of only 27 percent, even without counting the votes that correspond to 879 of the total 6.074 minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of Michoac치n Electoral Institute (MEI), Maria de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the last November 9th, the electoral body approved a set of guidelines in order to harmonize the local regulations with the electoral federal reform.
As it will be recalled, Michoac치n did not authorize the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Justice Act, since the Congress of the state approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to come into force in this electoral process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the periods specified in the Law in the State Official Gazette, arguing that he had some objections.
The same November 9th, the Supreme Court of Justice (SCJ) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislature and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state representative for the constitutional reforms, since he has no right "to sanction or vote them."
Interviewed about the possibility of the "vote by vote," Maria de los Angeles Llanderal stated that with the adoption of the appropriate guidelines by the General Council of the MEI it will be possible to perform partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial recount of one or more electoral boxes may occur in the assumptions that: the results of the records do not match; there is no record of the count on the record of the box or they are not included in the power of the president; or when there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all boxes of the election may take place when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election in question and the one who has obtained the second place in the voting, is equal to or less than one percentage point, as long as at the beginning of the session there is a request of the representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the second of the mentioned candidates.
The total vote count will also be done if at the end of the ordinary calculation is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate placed on second position is equal to or less than one percentage point, as long as there is a request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came on the second position, case in which there will be excluded the electoral boxes that have been considered during the partial recount.
There should be noted that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to PERP the difference between the first and the second place is of just 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
