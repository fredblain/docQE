Deutsche Bank pays multi-million pound fine in the USA
Fresh trouble is following hard on the heels of the uproar around Josef Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a multi-million pound fine in the USA.
As if the problems at home were not already enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant's past in the USA is now also catching up with it. Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank will pay 145 million dollars (106 million Euros) to settle disputes arising from the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis.
The issue centres on the sale of mortgage securities.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a string of major banks of having used false promises to mislead credit unions into buying the financial products.
The value of the securities dropped dramatically during the financial crisis and brought down the credit unions.
"We are happy to have resolved the issue without the parties going to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in new York.
The bank did not admit culpability in the settlement.
The same is true of Citigroup, which agreed to pay 20.5 million dollars.
The NCUA chairman, Debbie Matz, welcomed the responsiveness of the two banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcies to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for losses that run into the billions.
The current settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also approached other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The dubious mortgage securities are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
They are underpinned by home loans.
This sealed the fate of a number of financial companies when the US property bubble exploded in 2007.
The US investment bank, Lehman Brothers, went belly up in September 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.
The banks battling against a strong wind in the USA several years later.
Investors and regulators have brought a vast number of claims for compensation or to punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has been behind the largest wave of claims.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having taken in US lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on mortgage transactions valued at around 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also faces legal action by the FHFA covering multiple transactions with a total value of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The regulator is demanding that the Frankfurt-based bank take responsibility for "substantial losses," but has not yet specified the exact sum.
Deutsche Bank has rejected the claims as baseless and has declared its intention to fend off the claims.
