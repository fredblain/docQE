The Secretary Dionisio Perez Jacome gives details of the crash where the Interior Minister, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Ministry of Communications and Transportation (MCT) reported that the results obtained on the accident in which the Interior Secretary Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others died, indicate that the helicopter hit directly the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot attempting a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades came into contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it fulfilled the necessary requirements to transport people.
He also said that the investigations made ​​in the area of impact do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a research it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship in another place, the impact is presented in a structural way.
"The design of the helicopter conceived for 19 passengers, fulfilled the appropriate requirements for transporting passengers.
The land has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
For now, the secretary said it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation may take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential helicopter was operating in cruising speed and that this happened in a soft ascending land.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of the impact," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Perez Jacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation regulations the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, this means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Weather Conditions:
AICM reports were indicating suitable conditions for taking off as the aircraft moved towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State there were layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew has searched an area of lower elevation and greater visibility into the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft radar match, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change in the flight direction.
Dispersion of wreckage on a small area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and lateral line.
The dispersion of the wreckage suggests that the helicopter struck the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
There was not detected evidence of fire or explosion:
On the area of the accident there remains undisclosed evidence in the wreckage of the craft, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent research results indicate it may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work there have been found pieces of the aircraft at an altitude of 9.200 feet above mean sea level, the ground has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it dismantled along that journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After a thorough research in a wider area than the surrendered off area, near the place the accident took place, there have not been found scattered pieces of the aircraft, which strengthens the assumption that the impact is presented in terms of structural integrity.
