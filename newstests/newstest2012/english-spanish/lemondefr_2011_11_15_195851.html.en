Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new programme of adjustment to rescue its economy.
This was declared on Monday 14 November by the Prime Minister Lucas Papad√©mos in parliament, adding that the 100 days granted to his coalition government were not long enough for the accomplishment of this task.
"To pursue the efforts of rescuing the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment " declared the head of government, who made his first public speech opening the debate on the vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the Eurozone on 27 October shall be the "principal task" of the new government, because participation of the country in the Eurozone "is at stake," he added.
Consequently, M. Papademos forecast that the country's public deficit would be reduced to "about 9%" of the PIB by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right rejects new austerity measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the Right, gave his support to already approved measures to try and emerge from the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the deputies of his New Democracy party.
He declared his agreement with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and of the debt and of the struggle against waste, but also his opposition to any policy which would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who warned that the FMI and the EU would not unblock the loan of 8 thousand million Euros required, without a written guarantee of all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under outside pressure.
