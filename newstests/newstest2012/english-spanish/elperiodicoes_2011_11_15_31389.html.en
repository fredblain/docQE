Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was created to prevent the fall on the margins of the society of untrained young men
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this century quarter.
To this there are added over a hundred jobs currently created ​​for this social group.
The anniversary served to make a balance at a ceremony held in the old factory complex Fabra i Coats where attended over 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little education, no job, and drug problems or at risk of falling into marginality.
The yesterday celebration at Sant Andreu gathered a large number of responsible entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The diverse political representation, in the election time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Next to the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the ceremony the ex counselor of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the ex lieutenant of the mayor and current eco socialist Councilman Ricard Goma.
Also attended at the Fabra i Coats the actual Counselor for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and CEO of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
He said Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base."
The president gave Trinijove as an example for fighting against the bad circumstances and giving hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not new to the entity and the work done by it," he said.
