Support Workers' Union Will Sue City Over Layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon available to the union, District Council 37, in its effort to reverse the layoffs.
Six hundred seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city's lowest paid lost their jobs on Oct. 7, in a move union leaders have described as political payback for their refusal to let the city access a health care fund run by labor groups to close its budget gap last spring.
City officials have categorically denied that accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Schools Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget they signed off on in June.
One council member fired back, telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be laid off.
District Council 37 officials said they filed a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued; it will hold a news conference on Wednesday to announce the lawsuit's filing formally, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The suit will list Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants, and counts eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino women, as were most of the aides who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Law Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the complaint obtained by The New York Times, the union has zeroed in on the number of layoffs at schools in poor parts of the city to support a claim of inequitable treatment, saying poor schools lost more aides because they had been chronically underfinanced.
It points out that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aides lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were let go in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aides employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a neighborhood of well-heeled parents who can fund-raise to make up the budget shortfalls."
P.S. 36"s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the extra financing for each poor student schools enroll.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by the language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memo used the word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" more commonly describes the act of moving a teacher from a school's payroll into a pool of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were laid off," the draft complaint says, "and not merely excessed."
