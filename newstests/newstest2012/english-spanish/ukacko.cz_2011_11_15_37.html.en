EU Ambassadress Vicenová:
Czechs have the reputation of being negative and euro-sceptical
"Lisbon Treaty caused significant imbalance between individual institutions."
"I did not expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five or six years before the situation becomes somewhat stable, calm, and before all players get used to their new roles," EU Ambassadress Milena Vicenová opened her lecture at the Law Department sharply.
She proved how true she is to her "Clearly and openly about Europe" motto in the very first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU organs and the relationships between them in such a clear and intelligible, way that many lecturers from the UK Law Dept. could be jealous.
Moreover, Vicenová praised the work of new long-term President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, critics said he was plain, a grey office mouse who cannot fulfil any roles; I have to say everyone was amazed at how wonderfully he acquitted his role."
"He is a person who can listen to all twenty-seven member states, communicate with them perfectly, and who has a clear vision of where the EU should be headed."
She explained her new position of foreign affairs and security policy representative as a reply to a question: "Who is the European Union? Which phone number should I call?"; i.e. as an important step to unification and better clarity of Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
No One Wants To Ban Our Cheese Specialties
Vicenová further focused on the agenda crucial for the EU in the past, present, and near future.
She described Czech presidency from the year before last as a success.
Czechs were dealing with the coming financial crisis; they solved the as crisis; and organised the East Partnership Summit.
She said the fall of the government at the time was a great negative causing significant damage to the Czech Republic.
Currently, Czech representatives in the EU has been very busy.
As the ambassadress said, both the presidency and the following financial crisis caused an ongoing stirring.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget needs to be passed, which is very complicated due to the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be slim and frugal; which fields will be given preference; which countries will be supported more and which less; all of that is on the coming agenda.
The ambassadress reminded the key slogans she took to Brussels: "About Europe, Clearly."
"I really do not like all the abbreviations, foreign words, and jargon no one understands.
How are citizens supposed to understand that in Brussels, people are not trying to come up with crooked or round cucumbers, different size bananas, or that someone wants to ban our cheese specialties.'
She also wants to use the EU environment better, and get more Czechs into European institutions.
Multispeed Europe Is Coming
The ambassadress says Czechs are said to be Euro-sceptics; as well as people noticing the negative rather than the positive sides of things.
She wishes more Czech representatives were involved in European institutions.
She thinks numerous factors are to blame: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters; together with low support from the Czech side.
Along with the success of Czech presidency, she highlighted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak is coming to join us, the Frenchman next to me says: "Hey, what's that gathering about, is that the Visegrad Group again?' and he is not happy about it in the slightest.'
In the Union's future, Vicenová expects mainly new strict rules for the budget policy of member states.
Rather than a new European Federation, she finds the concept of two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, very realistic.
"We have both countries inside and outside the Eurozone."
"We have Schengen area, and we already have an institute of reinforced cooperation."
"For the first time it was said that the countries who want are to cooperate, while those who are not willing can stand off."
"The number of such institutes will be growing; it will be a highly two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this regard, she appreciated the roles of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in pushing forward the rule based on which, all topics influencing the entire EU should be negotiated by all member states, and not just those belonging into the Eurozone.
