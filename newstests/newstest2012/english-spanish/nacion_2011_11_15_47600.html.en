The familiarity of the Spanish is higher than that of the Ticos
Of the 22 players called in Spain, ten passed 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica only one of 22 called players reached 50 games.
A minor contrast to Costa Rica, comparing the 22 players called by both countries for the friendly game today, at 3:05 pm at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and Europe champions, number one in the monthly top of FIFA, have a long record of Class A inter selection, the Tricolor has only the defender Michael Umana as the only one who has 50 international games.
That number was reached Friday before the game against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernandez.
Spanish football players playing in the All-Star League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England are during the year very active in league and local cup competitions and there are high-level shocks in the European Cups and Champions League.
To this is added the Spanish Fury experience in complicated qualifications for Euro and World Cup.
The Ticos players, however, have a limited international experience in an area such as CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA
We see that the peak of the Spanish selection is the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (game lost with 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the ex goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will impose a new record of 127 international matches for Spain.
Xavi Hernandez, the player of Barcelona, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Xavi were recognized last week by UEFA together with the other player of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta with 126 matches and Schalke striker Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Almost near the centennial number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Xabi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres, with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andres Iniesta, with 62, Cesc Fabregas, with 61, and David Silva, with 53.
On Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana, are the left-lateral Junior Diaz, with 48 matches and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After this, only five exceeded the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
The least.
More than 30 matches in Spain have Gerard Piqu√© (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, there are Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't come near the 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder did not debut yet.
The leading scorer of Spain is David Villa is, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that registers more points, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
