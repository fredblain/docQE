Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversies over fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopened the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In mid 80's at the height of the now extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (MCB), this Administration printed promotional leaflets of Collserola.
The booklet defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
On the death of the MCB, in 1987, the park was placed again in the minds of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, ​​being the Catalan capital one of the few that is not oriented towards the north-south but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park redounds in this idea.
The reference was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with the wild boar on the role of Yogi Bear.
This was all about until, in September, the council called for a mega competition composed of 16 contests for as many other doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put gates to the field.
The question comes alone: Collserola? Park or mountain?
The competition, both as for its merely organizational side as for its reflection on the city is a topic of conversation among all architects of Barcelona.
It's almost a recurrent theme to make use of when two members of this ancient lineage of elected persons recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise precisely to one of the few similarities between what three architects of Barcelona are saying and the academics, which have been presented.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roland, after approaching the coastline becomes "necessary" to discuss about "the mountain front," whenever Ildefons Cerda's speech, that of green apples has not been carried out.
"It should be assumed that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect to whom the title of "gates of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": we should not think about them "as access to a park, but as the delimitation of some areas where we must act."
Modolo, as Roland and Bayona with experience in the urban world, called the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers."
Hazards arising from the "uncertainty of projecting the public space" after the experience of the 80"s which had in the Forum area "his swan song."
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders where to build.
"Limiting something is setting up the next step," meaning, overcoming.
"We must think of new urban planning tools, because the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Tighter to the question, Modolo believes that simplifying the Collserola valley side "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, ​​not" by a purely topographical issue.
Modolo remembers that there is already a work done by the Board of Collserola that "should not fall on deaf ears," although he is grateful for the opportunity that the city hall offers to his profession to intervene in this project "from the very beginning."
And further, understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "he doubts" about whether this technical profile is the one that should lead multidisciplinary teams ("a success," he points) that have had to create: "The architects should be only a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because the contest rules lack a global view of Collserola: "16 cross contests have been called -he says-on sea- mountain sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, to see and understand the area as a whole."
This leads, at least in this case, to have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the gates can crash into the program and definition with the project of the architect of the next gate.
In your opinion, the council should ensure that the band immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety, an area of equipment to conduct a smooth transition between the city and the green.
