Mrs. Sofia: "They are instruments of progress and hope"
The queen highlights the "dominant" place in Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a prominent place worldwide in the role of Microfinance."
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become over the last two decades the second donor in relation to the instruments of cooperation; whose "essence" she said lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings."
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth Global Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the belief that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations for 2015, and, "especially having as a goal halving the volume of people living with less than a dollar per day, with this fixing the "poverty line."
Spain is "still working" to expand the network of beneficiaries all over the world, and assumes the task with "responsibility" said Mrs. Sofia, who hoped that the efforts and contributions originated in the Summit, which will be held until Thursday, will "ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women," the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we are facing."
The Microcredit Summit arises not only as a forum for debate, but also as a platform that promotes "two basic goals."
Thus, His Majesty explained that she hopes that at the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will have acceded to these financial services and one hundred million of these households will get out of the poverty in which they are immersed.
The impulse for the creation of micro credits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path started years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Mrs. Sofia as an "act of justice and recognition."
And she described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist of the universal cause of the fight against poverty," whose work is known for 15 years, when the Queen went to Bangladesh to find out in the field the policy of loans.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have seen the continued evolution," said His Majesty, whose link with this project made her earn yesterday the title of the "head of the family" in Valladolid from the "banker of the poor."
Finally, the Queen Mrs. Sofia concluded by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and find solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jim√©nez, said that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" to every democratic state.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic boom, as it is a "continuing obligation."
Jimenez found that microcredit supposes "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty," and now "more than ever," the governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not let this fall as victim of adjustments.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, praised the "success" to give "trust" to people "excluded to whom all doors are closed," and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors caught by the spirit of solidarity."
