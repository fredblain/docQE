Ronaldo rockets Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of Bosnians and Turks for a last minute win were short-lived.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will be at the 2012 European championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have got the final spots for the Euro 2012 championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo who scored in the 8th and 53rd minutes, Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1), rounding off their fifth Euro appearance perfectly after 0:0 in the first leg.
The Czechs only needed 1:0 (0:0) in the playoff second leg against outsider Montenegro after a clear win in the first leg (2:0).
Croatia did not miss a trick with 0:0 against Turkey and Ireland managed an easy 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Helder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other goals for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic and captain Emir Spahic evened the score with a converted 41st-minute penalty and a goal in the 65th for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a second yellow card in the 54th minute.
Bosnia had already been knocked out of the World Cup 2010 playoffs in South Africa against Portugal.
Portugal got off to a perfect start in Lisbon's Estadio da Luz.
Ronaldo pounded a free kick into the nets from about 30 meters to take an early lead.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani displayed his long-range abilities, raising the lead to 2:0 from the 25 metre line.
The Bosnians, with no opening in the first half hour, had their first opportunity with goal scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player from the English championship leader Manchester City put a header onto the bottom edge of the crossbar in the 33rd minute, but the ball did not go over the goal line.
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
The referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding then garnered some attention.
Following an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute, Stark decided the Portuguese player had simulated and gave him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a controversial penalty for handball after a foul by Fabio Coentrao - Misimovic converted.
After half-time, the vice-European champions of 2004 settled the score with four more goals.
Petr Jiracek cleared up any remaining doubt for the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The European champions of 1976 are going to the Euro Championship for the fifth time in a row.
Luck also smiled on trainer Michal Bilek's team and Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) with a potentially catastrophic error early on.
Goalie Petr Cech prevented a potential own goal from Tomas Sivok in the 9th minute with a split-second reflex.
Montenegro had its best opportunities when the Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic duo were on the field.
Damjanovic took a shot from the edge of the penalty area that just missed Cech's goal in the 40th minute.
After half-time, the crossbar saved the Czechs" already battered world-class goalie after the forward from FC Seoul retreated in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before full-time.
Turkey, meanwhile, was lacking football genius in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks could do no better than a 0:0 draw in Zagreb.
While it is now virtually a certainty that national trainer Guus Hiddink must now give up his place on the bench of the team that reached third place in 2002, the Croatians are through to the final round of a European championship for the fourth time.
The Turks almost managed the perfect start in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir stadium.
Selcuk Inan's long-range shot hit the post in the seventh minute and striker Kazim Kazim was unable to put the rebound into the net.
Croatia then woke up, taking more and more control of the game.
The Croatians continued in fine form after half-time.
The Budesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were on the field alongside Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made space for Ivan Perisic from Dortmund from the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni going to Euro 2012
The Irish in Dublin were celebrating their first appearance at the European championship since 1988 in Germany.
Trainer Giovanni Trapattoni's team - already looking assured of a place following the 4:0 victory in the first leg - took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to a goal from Stephen Ward.
Konstantin Vassiljev equalised for the away team in the 57th minute.
Ireland kept up the pace, but had to wait until the 23rd minute when Robbie Keane from Los Angeles had the first clean shot on goal.
The Estonian rearguard prevented him at the last moment from taking Ireland into the lead.
The goal came in the 32nd minute.
After a failed defence by goalie Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to bring the score to 1:0.
