Rychtářová about her Unfaithful Husband:
Iveto, keep the fool, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it is over!
After her husband, Josef Rychtář (53), became both the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still hoped he would wake up and come back home.
However, she does not want to wait any longer, and set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa may return home, but no longer as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová provided shelter for Bartošová in her house in summer, she probably had not the slightest idea of what was going to happen to her marriage.
Even though she had Iveta move out of Říčany 30 days later, Pepa would not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publically admitted he loved her.
After some time, Darina resigned, pretended to accept her husband's affair; and now she gave him her final goodbye.
Rychytář does not care who his wife sleeps with
Even if one day Rychtář and Bartošová would split up, his wife will not welcome him with open arms.
"He is the biological father to my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will chase him out."
"However, he will complete his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a person I have certain bonds to," Rychtářová said, adding she had already disengaged herself from her husband and only insists on mutual decency.
So far, Josef does not mind that his wife closed the hind gate on him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta, and I don't mean to change that."
"My wife decided for marriage on paper, and I respect it."
"Our company still operates; I am in charge of repairs, garden, the house, and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate in a completely normal way, only we do not share our bed anymore," Rychtář said for Blesk.
He claims that if Rychtářová found a new love, he would not stand in her way.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, with whom, and if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and I accept full responsibility," Josef concluded.
