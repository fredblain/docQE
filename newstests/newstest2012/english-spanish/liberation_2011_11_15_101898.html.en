Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic which cannot be dealt with via short-term considerations, or under the stress of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity affect directly the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an electoral rendezvous should be an occasion for reflecting on such stakes and the place occupied by nuclear power.
The debate will not be fruitful, unless it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on the objective facts of rational data.
Now that we are 7 thousand million human beings on the planet, demographic development will involve a doubling of demand for electricity by 2050, unless a huge proportion of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
During the same period, it will become necessary to palliate the increasing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently without forgetting the overriding need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to fight climatic imbalance, a subject which has vanished from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not modify any of these parameters.
This is why Germany is isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which subordinates its decision to the need to find a source able to replace nuclear energy, or that of Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern ones.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil to quote only a few, pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their range by resuming the construction of a centre, which was interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
Although the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes quoted as an example, the reality contradicts that argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in a rise of the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence aggravated by increased recourse to imported gas, in particular from Russia, a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and of coal centres.
In a few months all these adverse effects will already be felt.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
Champion of Europe in the construction of turbines, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and of gas due to intermittent wind; due to which its carbon dioxide emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the constancy of energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for their electricity than French households.
Since in the worldwide economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a stake in the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Due to this, any significant fall in the cost of nuclear energy would bring about a big rise of cost of electricity, which would render illusory the fine declarations on re-industrialisation of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
A price, which a large majority of the French refuse to pay, all the more so, since they do not object to this form of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the energy policy of our country made it possible to establish an industrial line of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 resulting ones.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a galaxy of specialised RME's in international markets and creates many jobs, which cannot be moved elsewhere.
If France decided to abandon nuclear power, she would sacrifice a large number of these RME's and lose the annual 6 thousand million Euro's worth of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would recommend a EPR designed to function for sixty years, if the decline of its manufacture was programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous or diabolical source of production of electricity.
The development by Areva of low carbon dioxide emission solutions, nuclear and renewable, bears witness to the complementary nature sources of energy.
For nuclear energy to maintain the highest level of safety, is absolutely vital.
In France, we have a safety authority, which exercises an intransigent and transparent control of existing generation centres such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, are accustomed to the same safety-related obsession.
In a space of 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental consequences.
At Tchernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human error brought about the drama.
At Fukushima, some people appear to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it has from its two predecessors.
The fruit of this step and of cooperation between safety authorities, the operators and French and German constructors, the EPR presents a design enabling it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is being considered by all electricians wishing to construct a generation centre, a decision to construct it at Flamanville would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF by clearing their way to seizing the leadership of the unavoidable development of nuclear energy.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best fan of energies for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres to dominate the debate, which is so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
