The climatic adversity slowed down the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopez Valdez management, in Sinaloa increased the unemployment and the informality, foreign investment declined and the economy was reduced.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, being related to the first year of Mario Lopez Valdez government also called the year of change, which generated great expectations as regards the development of the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, however there was registered a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
The low February temperatures, not only did they cause losses of millions for the agricultural sector, but they limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, causing a contraction of the economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly supported by the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report regarding the areas affected by the frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development there were damaged 835.582 hectares, out of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining of 21.07 percent had partial damage. The main damaged crops were the vegetables, corn and chickpea.
The fall in the economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase of the unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment state rate during the first three quarters of the year registered an accelerated growth, from January to March 55.053 Sinaloa habitants were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population for the second quarter, the rate became 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent, a rate that in terms of the number of people represents more than 74.000 of unemployed Sinaloa habitants, an increase compared to the first half of 18.969 individuals.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multi-factorial, for the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director at the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that the public policy has been taken.
"What we're seeing now is an increase of the unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for the purpose of a resource constraint imposed by the legislation that passed in the Congress in order to combat money laundering since for the people who illegally possess dollars is not easy work with, invest and use them in something" he said.
Stopped Immigration
Lopez Cervantes said that in the increase of unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leaves the state in search of a job abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first of all due to the difficulties to enter, and second of all because once they enter they already have too many difficulties in finding a job, that group of people is staying and demanding jobs here, in the state, causing the rate of unemployment to rise, "he said.
Informality
The labor market analysis of Sinaloa gets worse when considering the high level of informality that prevails among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the active population in the state works without being quoted as workers to any social security institution.
In addition to the unemployment and informality, another state labor reminder is represented by low wages; the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
The monthly average income of Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5.352 pesos, well below the national average, that is of 7.375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
In addition to the fall in economic activity and high unemployment rate, in 2011 there was recorded the largest decline in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance from January to June the state FDI totaled 630.697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5.143.312 dollars during the same period of last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government accounted a total investment of 17.280.000 pesos during the year, which occurred mainly in tertiary sector companies.
Debt
Against the backdrop of economic downturn, the state government asked in July during the state congress, the approval of a credit of 3 billion pesos, which would be for the investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the local congressional approval was for a total of 2.600 million pesos, and until November no benefits of the debt were observed in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of Mario Lopez Valdes government demonstrates a lack of capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really poor, one has to work hard in order to regain the ground lost this year, in 2012 we must redouble our efforts, we failed to align the efforts of all and above all the good and synchronized motion of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better" he said.
Economic slowness
Lopez Loredo said that the events such as early frost this year stopped the state economy and its performance and growth were restricted.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy which does not turn fast enough for generating an economic dynamism that allows having an acceptable flow level of the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing it below our expectations," he said.
Redefining the vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers" Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state is required to prosecute the most dynamic productive activities.
"Overall, we found that there has been working on, we believe it is necessary to develop a long term program that redefines the vocation and the economic course of the state, it is important to detonate all the material and human potential resource that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to Do
Coparmex President stressed the importance of establishing a future vision to guide better the efforts of the government.
"Overall I would say that the Government has been striving to be successful in various fields, in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its own manner of leading the public policy.
"There are elements that allow us saying that the government is becoming more inclusive, and what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to do," he said.
