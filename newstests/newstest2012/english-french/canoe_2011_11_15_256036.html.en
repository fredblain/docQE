Anti-Moslem crimes have increased by 50%
Between 2009 and 2010, anti-Moslem crimes increase by almost 50%, whilst during the same period other forms of racial and religious violence had fallen slightly, or had not changed, according to FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Moslems moved from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, equal to an increase of 49%, as against an increase of 13% of cases of violence against Catholics, a fall of 4% of attacks on Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes.
The global number of hate crimes increased very slightly to 6 628 cases, of which 47,3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to FBI.
"After a decrease in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes increasing again, stressed the rights of man organisation, Human Rights First, "the increase of cases of anti-Moslem violence is particularly significant," added the organisation in a communiqu√©.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Moslems, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be regarded as serious violations of human rights," adds one of the managers of the organisation, Paul Legendre.
"The American government can and must do more to deal with his abuse, he adds, judging that this could be due to the editing of police reports on hate crimes."
"Hate crime" in Federal law, is a legacy from the period of struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, colour of skin, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
