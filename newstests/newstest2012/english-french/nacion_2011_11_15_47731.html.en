Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
The ex President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital in order to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength that occurs in the legs, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who is sentenced at 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including cancer of the tongue for which he has been operated four times and it is kept under control.
The congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told to Canal N of television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in order to determine the reason for the pain and the loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for getting the benefit of pardon on humanitarian grounds; however, he said he did not want this because he knows he is innocent.
He had surgery four times for cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other diseases were added such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the legs, listed the doctor.
Fujimori is in prison since September 2007 in the Police National Department of Special Operations.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for killing 25 people at the hands of a squad of annihilation of the army that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
