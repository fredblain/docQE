The world according to the republican presidential candidates
Concerning China, Iran, aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplification and a lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by crisis, lead a complex world by simple and indeed, simplistic,ideas ?
To listen to republican presidential candidates, the electors might believe it.
For some days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others multiply resounding and abbreviated foreign policy declarations, which are traditionally a republican strong suit.
Concerning China, Iran and aid to Israel, the slogans, are often fused together.
Mitt Romney, the best placed for nomination of the "Grand Old Party," threatened to drag the Chinese before the OMC and to accuse them of "manipulation of their currency, a sensitive subject in an America exasperated by the migration of whole sections of its industry to Asia.
So much the worse if this should trigger a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a vision of a sophisticated foreign policy, has failed to suppress an attitude which flatters the emotions.
He called for a muscular, but a constructive, dialogue with Peking (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is stagnating at the bottom of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran, if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he trumpeted."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
Hr also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to wards that partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, declares an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for opposition to the Chinese military threat, because Peking is trying to develop a nuclear capacity - apparently unaware of the fact that China has possessed it since 1964!
The Texas governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants military strikes against Iran, says that he is ready to involve the USA army in Mexico against the drug cartels.
Resort to the torture of terrorist suspects prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and by the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from the 2008 republican candidate John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to water down his wine concerning anti-terrorism.
They insist with good reason on the setback of his naive dialogue with Iran on the premature departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his tergiversations in Libya labelling him weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population judges as positive Obama's the balance of national security, which eliminated Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it distrusts military interventions, which run into quicksands.
And in arguing that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
