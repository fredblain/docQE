General Meeting Should Find a President, Mate Threat Returns
For nearly five months, Czech football has had no President. There exists a risk that Ivan Hašek's successor, the head of Czech Republic's Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which is to take place in Nymburk on Thursday.
There is still no agreement as to which election rules to follow.
Without it, voting for the three candidates will not start.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta, and Tomáš Paclík are eager to lead Czech football.
Hašek resigned from his function in June. When leaving, he called to his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future.
However, Hašek's era sees football back in quarrels between both association chambers, unable to agree on a common candidate.
This was fully shown on September 16, when a new President was to be chosen.
General meeting delegates wasted their trip to the National House in Prague, Smíchov, as the negotiations remained blocked, not just regarding the election method.
No agreement was reached as to who is entitled to vote at the general meeting - whether the statutory representatives only, or also officials given power of attorney.
This single point has been partially settled since, thanks to a recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation based on power of attorney is not possible.
Arguments concerning the election rules continue, though.
The Executive Board has not been of much help either, though at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is mostly preoccupied by this issue.
The view of election options has changed several times, but the key point remains the same.
The question is: How to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid mate?
"The argument is based on whether to follow the by-laws or to find another model," says one of the three FAČR Vice-Presidents, Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association's management.
Based on the model given by the by-laws, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate with higher percentage support from the chamber he is the candidate for.
Moravia is said to accept a compromise to have a candidate with the highest percentage of total votes from both chambers win the election.
The Czech part stresses a condition that in the percentage total, the winner must gain at least two-third superiority.
"However, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; that would completely deny the two-chamber concept," Svoboda agrees with Moravia's arguments. He says it would be best not to bend the rules and vote according to the existing regulations.
Somewhat surprisingly Tomáš Paclík agrees with his opinion even if it is estimated that the election rules defined by the by-laws fits Pelta best of the candidates.
'I wish the elections follow the by-laws to the maximum.'
"I want to avoid all kinds of representative nonsense, as at the previous general meeting," says the owner of Viktorie Plzeň, who is a candidate for the first time; and in his statements he chiefly stood against Pelta.
Pelta remains an optimist.
He believes the new President will be known in Nymburk; he also hopes that in the future, the candidates will cooperate constructively.
"All passionate stirring will calm down with today's prospective advance of the national team into the European Championship."
"Football will be back on the happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate," a Jablonec functionary says. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience with football management on both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very ambivalent."
"It is not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts at purposeful adjustment of regulations."
"That may cause another blockage of the general meeting."
"I hope the common sense wins," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for an agreement between the parties.
Some negotiations are said to have taken place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if the football generality will be complete before the match.
An extra flight that was to take, among others, the Vice Presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl to Podgorica did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure. An alternative was sought for in order to transport part of the executive board to the scene of the barraged rematch.
Finally, a meeting at ministry level, said to happen on Wednesday, may decide.
Minister of Education, Youth, and Sports, Josef Dobeš, would like to force the split parties inside the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement.
A lot is in the game: Government grants; football trustworthiness; and the planned ČSTV general meeting dealing with new direction of Czech sports following Sazka's financial problems.
Paclík Enters the Presidential Fight As He Cannot See a Suitable Candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the Head of Pilsen football players, Tomáš Paclík, saw a strong candidate, who would meet all of his expectations of a new Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) President, he would not even apply for the top function.
"If there was a good quality candidate, I'd fight for him and not participate in the fight."
"But no such person has currently been found," Paclík said to ČTK.
Paclík's motivation to join the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to try to prevent Pelta, reportedly the favourite of the elections, from entering the top of the FAČR.
Moreover, Paclík emphasizes that should he win, he would only remain the President until 2013, when a regular general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like to see the position given to an experienced top manager, not excessively connected to football life.
"I've spoken to some people that could be considered."
"I was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at this point, they don't even want to identify themselves with Czech football."
"I'd like to change this opinion," he said.
At the moment, Paclík's strongest disagreement with Pelta is based on the latter's connection to Roman Berbr, President of Pilsen's regional football association. Berber is a man of controversial reputation, who is, behind the scenes, known as powerful lobbyist, capable of influencing the votes of general meeting delegates.
Paclík therefore finds it unacceptable for Pelta to become the President.
"If he wins, current situation will be preserved and nothing in football would move forward."
"Combined with support from Berbr, a capable businessman, this would be even more harmful for the football," Paclík said.
He is hinting at the fact that some years ago, Pelta's name was recorded during phone tapping in a corruption affair investigation; Pelta came out without a sentence.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory would bring to football."
"And how would we look in the eyes UEFA and FIFA," Paclík said. He is now more detached from his former statement saying he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became President."
In case Paclík wins on Thursday, he could imagine cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting that ended as a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
'He is very capable.'
"I can see him as the head of the representation."
'But he cannot manage the association.'
"I don't poke my nose in what I don't understand either,' said Paclík, who gained a lot of attention in September, when he supported the removal of board of referees, led by Luděk Macela, replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík claims he would dare to manage the association.
He refers to his skills from management of private companies; since last summer, he has been managing the Pilsen team that, with his support, celebrated its first league triumph in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its improvement."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, leading to disgusting situations," Paclík said. He does not hide his antipathy for, e.g. Sparta's Director, Daniel Křetínský.
One of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose support he would lobby at the political top to get more money for sports from the lottery tax.
"That's one of the key things the new President should attend to."
"If taxes are imposed on gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly say where the money will go," he said.
Paclík does not consider his connection with the Pilsen club a burden, though he claims that an FAČR President should be a non-party one.
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, and Rajchl to Prague Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"Yet, I don't see a point in transferring my shares in the Pilsen club hypocritically to someone else, while coming back there in six months, " Paclík says.
Pelta Promised New FAČR Regulations That Would Avoid Election Mate
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the Presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he is elected, he would strive for new FAČR regulations to avoid future disputes over the election rules.
Before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk, a Jablonec functionary remains an optimist and believes that the pre-election fight would be significantly suppressed by today's prospective success of our football representation.
Prior to the failed election in September, Pelta promised that if he was to win, he would focus on both the representation and gaining of financial means.
He decided to participate in the elections before the last general meeting at the last moment. A two-month delay thus could have been useful for him to defend his ideas concerning football management in wider context.
"People at all levels have been in football for long, and they expect the President to be known on Thursday."
"They feel it's high time someone leads the association," claims the man chiefly connected with the Jablonec club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the association's executive board.
This gives him the reason to believe he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes current problems with elections are caused by the euphoria there was in the time of Ivan Hašek's reign.
"Unfortunately, regulations that were not as perfect as we all thought were passed at the general meeting in June."
"If various representations were not accepted, we would have had a President since September," Pelta said.
He approached the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a decoy for the delegates.
"If I become President, I will take it as my personal task, and I'm willing to take personal responsibility in case the attempt fails."
"It is a fundamental issue we cannot exist without," Pelta claims.
Other than that, he says he does not try to define himself against the rivals.
In the past, he has already announced he can imagine his cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognises for his legal education; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first Vice President.
For a long time, he did not attack Tomáš Paclík, who has constantly criticised Pelta.
"He's been in football for over a year, and gained some success."
"However, his attacks were not decent, and many people were caught by surprise by the method of his election campaign."
"This is too, is why some of them now doubt his true character," Pelta said about his rival. Pelta himself claims to be true to the proclamations he announced in September.
He sees his strongest weapon in knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to representation.
The representation should be the shopping window of football.
"Í would also try to end all affairs, starting from the Bohemians case or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
"Right after that, I would focus on negotiations with both private and state sectors, to ensure enough money for the whole football," the forty-six year old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his arrival to the head of the football would not mean any personnel housecleaning.
"I'd need to learn about the job descriptions of individual employees." That was his message for Strahov, where the long period of interregnum causes understandable nervousness.
Despite current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the general meeting planned, he believes that on Thursday, the delegates will not come to Nymburk in vain.
"If the only questionable point is how to perform the elections in the third round that is something we can get over."
"Football needs trustworthiness it can only gain by finally having its leader," says Pelta, who, two days before the crucial day of his career of a functionary, remains an optimist.
Rajchl Promises That under Him, the FAČR Will Start Working Hard
If, on Thursday's general meeting, Jindřich Rajchl, the existing Vice President, is to become the President of Czech Football Association, many people in the Association would reportedly not be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, hard work will come.
He wants to establish system changes and make members of the executive board responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; bring more money to football; and continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Hašek.
"As President, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to representation, professional football, and performance football for the youth."
"By this, I don't mean I'd do everything on my own," Rajchl said in his interview for ČTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to distribute the competences within the executive board so that each member focuses on a certain area."
'I'll distribute tasks strictly so that in each of these segments, football makes big steps forward."
"That would probably not please many people, as it would mean hard work, not just criticizing of the work of others," he added.
Critical atmosphere in football movement supposedly made him doubt his candidature.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it has any sense; and that I won't be surrounded by people throwing sticks under my feet and question my every move," he explained his hesitation.
"However, many people told me I mustn't give up, otherwise others would follow."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
Moreover, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Hašek.
"A great amount of work was done in those two years, and I don't want to throw it all away."
"Processes have been started that may bear fruit in a few years, and I don't want someone else to stop them," he said, in fear that if the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, situation f the Association might return to the period before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic approach, which is something I don't think Mirek Pelta is competent of."
"He is chiefly surrounded by people who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen ones."
"I can be blamed for many things, but certainly not for being subjective."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone, because then everyone has a good time, not just the chosen few," Rajchl said.
Furthermore, he refutes the allegations he would only be a Czech President.
"Though some people try to claim the opposite, I plan to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is high time to consider about splitting the second league into Czech and Moravian parts, winners of which would continue into the first league."
"This would prevent the current situation, where there are just three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem concerning young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
As the Presidential fight has been joined by Pilsen club Manager, Tomáš Paclík, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances to win.
"Nevertheless, I can still feel a strong support in the Czech chamber that elected me its Vice President, and can see I have achieved some clear successes," Rajchl said. Among his successes, he includes the saving of dozens of millions of Crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiating TV contracts, and negotiations about the lottery law.
On the other hand, he considers the fact that the association does not stick together partially as his own fault.
While claiming that Pelta has been 'disqualified from returning trustworthiness to Czech football', he considers the other rival, Paclík, a strong candidate that has things to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen this year."
"If he is elected, I hope he would continue in the things Ivan Hašek started, without significant personnel changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't want to twist things for his own benefit," Rajchl said about his rival.
