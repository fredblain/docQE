The "angry persons" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were crowding round in front of Zuccotti square to camp.
A part of the protesters listened to the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the movement Occupy Wall Street challenged on Tuesday the authorities of New York when trying to enter again, under the protection of a court order, in the Manhattan Square where they were evacuated at dawn when trying to occupy another park of the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded round the Zuccotti square, where they wanted to get in thanks to a court order that allows "the angry persons" to camp on the site, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park north the city where there have been made further arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to return to camp in the square, we will camp somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said one of the spokesmen of the movement "Occupy Wall Street," Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "angry persons" to the evacuation of the camp issued personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing the demonstrators to remain camped.
In addition, the "angry persons" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the downtown Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for one hour they were able to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the precise number, while telling Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization ensures that there are several hundred people camped at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already gone to show their support to the members of the movement trying to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti square, which is a privately owned site, remains closed waiting for a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which to examine the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some of the protesters moved there were carrying and distributing at that time copies of that court order and even they gave these copies to officers guarding the place, which led to "some small confrontations," said Bray, who claimed that some officers beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities to evacuate the members of Occupy Wall Street and enforce "laws that were issued after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit demonstrators regain access to the park with shops and other property used before."
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that, because of that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the public space and protesters were informed, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with camping shops and sleeping bags.
The councilman personally defended the evacuation of the Zuccotti square carried out at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and this was decided so because protesters were "violating the law."
Bloomberg said he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, to do harm to others" as "Some businesses had received threats' and neighbors feared" for the quality of life."
"The evacuation of this morning was disgusting and shows that deep inside Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "disrespect for the freedom of expression."
The responsible of "Occupy Wall Street" also indicated that they intend to organize "great deeds" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, in order to commemorate the last two months of protests, which began on September 17th.
