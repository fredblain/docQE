What is sick leave fraud ?
After allowances, the UMP and the government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux to visit a family allowances allocation fund and to make a speech on this subject, which has been recurring since 2007, concerning the fight against social assistance fraud.
And to help this offensive stemming from a desire to make economies in the context of constraints, but which also forms part of the presidential re-election campaign, the majority want to concentrate on sick leave.
First and foremost, with a view to budgetary economies, the government intends to impose on private employees a fourth day of unemployment before the start of unemployment benefit
Clearly, without the specific consent of the employer, an employee falling sick will lose four days' pay equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
A measure, which threatens to arouse anger, but which, according to Les Echos, would produce a saving of 280 million Euros.
And which would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic effect, namely, the imposition on public employees of one day's wait for benefit payment in the case of sick leave (public employees have not hitherto had to wait for the payment of benefit, as against a three days' wait by private employees).
Now that these questions are being discussed, the majority are also relaunching the subject of fraud, targeting abuses linked to medical certificates.
"The controls will become more rigid and in addition, if you are caught, you will have to repay any non-legitimate benefit received," warned Xavier Bertrand on RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement appear a little disproportionate to the reality of medical certificate-related fraud.
This has actually been monitored constantly since 2002 via political offensives, which have usually borne fruit.
The French are no sicker than people elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first of all look at the national figures.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), over 237 million Euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to l'Institut de Recherche et de Documentation en Economie de la Sant√©,the daily compensation expenditure in 2008 at 11,3 thousand million Euros, was 5% of total health expenditure.
Of this sum, 46% concerned maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% sick leave benefit at 6,2 thousand million Euros.
And therefore represented 2,5% of health-related expenditure.
The French spent an average of 14,5 days on sick leave in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
An average, which conceals certain divergences; another inquiry published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site, showed that 75% of the 40 000 French employees questioned said that they had not taken any days of sick leave.
Another study, this time concerning sickness insurances, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days,15% 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% lasted longer.
Comparing these figures with those of their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined to take sick leave than those in any other country.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global rate of absence from work in France (for reasons of health or not) fluctuated between 10% and 11%, compared with between 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, or between 16% and 18% in The Netherlands.
Sickness certificate-related fraud is very low, compared with "black" labour.
As regards fraud, it is very low.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls of certificates valid for longer than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1,5 million controls,the CNAM found that 13% of the 285 000 controls on short-term sickness certificates were "unjustified," or too long," equal to 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled certificates valid for more than 45 days, 11% cases were found to be "inappropriate or unjustified" out of 1,2 million, equal to 132 000.
In total therefore, 169 000 cases were "unjustified," out of several million of employees issued with certificates.
A figure which represents very few cases, compared, for example, with the "black" labour figure.
According to the UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on the subject in June, this would represent 9 to 15 thousand million Euros annual tax shortfall, equal to more than the total cost of daily compensation and therefore infinitely higher than losses due to fraud.
