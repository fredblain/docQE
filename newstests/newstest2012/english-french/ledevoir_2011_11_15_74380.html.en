The King of Jordan calls on president Assad to relinquish power
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bachar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on the Syria of Bachar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, is resisting them and has denounced a "plot" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria from membership of the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced its sanctions against Damascus, whilst Syria's neighbours Turkey and Jordan, came out in favour of president Assad's departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on president Bachar al-Assad to relinquish power in Syria, where some forty civilians and members of the armed forces of the regime were killed.
"If Bachar had the interest of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of the political life, said the King of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in a BBC interview.
In his turn, the Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu deplored the fact that Turkish efforts to mediate, which began at the start of the year, did not meet with success.
"Those in the Middle East who are at peace with their people, but cannot satisfy their aspirations, will leave power, he said, alluding to Syria, a neighbouring country, on which Turkey is adopting an increasingly hard line.
For their part, the United States are congratulating themselves on the increased consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab Legaue,and countries such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harder line" in the face of the the repression in Syria, observed Mark Toner, a spokesman of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the armed forces of the regime die in the area of Deraa in the south of Syria, announced l'Observatoire syrien des droits de l'homme (OSDH).
Two other civilians died during exchanges of fire and heavy rifles at Jobar in the besieged town of Homs, according tot his ONG.
During a Press conference, the Syrian foreign minister Walid Mouallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis."
He moreover reacted strongly against the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus which according to him represents a "dangerous step."
Syria will not bend, he added, assuring that plots against Syria would fail."
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is at present studying "a protection mechanism for civilians and wants the dispatch of 500 members of of Arab rights of man organisations, of media and of military observers into the country.
The French foreign minister Alain Jupp√© also declared himself in favour to the dispatch of UNO observers to help to protect civilians from repression by the regime, which according to him, is "paranoid."
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is planned for tomorrow to debate the implementation of escape from the crisis decided on 2 November and foreseeing in particular, the withdrawal of armed forces from the towns in dispute and the liberation of arrested demonstrators.
The Russian foreign minister, Sergyey Lavrov, yesterday described as "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, whilst China exhorted Syria to implement the plan of emerging from the crisis, taking care not to support possible sanctions against Damascus.
