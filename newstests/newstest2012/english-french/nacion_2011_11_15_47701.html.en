Quintet included the country on the tour for celebrating two decades of experience
'Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true'
In an exclusive interview with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There were more than 20 years of wait, but the band says that for the member is also a dream turned into reality playing in the country.
This was stated by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American zone within the tour celebrating two decades of work and Sunday 20th will make its only stop in Central America.
That day they will be present at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 pm, together with the band of Los Angeles The X and the band of the nationals Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt of the conversation, whose full transcript is online in The Nation.
For your followers from Costa Rica, is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica? Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great.
I've been to Costa Rica only once, on vacation, it is a beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay a few days there.
So we are excited to bring our music there.
I ask this because there is a kind of devotion to the band; the fans live with intensity the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people as regards your concert refer to it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of pressure on your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks.
We had a few wonderful shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we are very eager to play there.
We love this country, we love to surf and the jungle, for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves here are incredible.
My friends are always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, these are great places to surf, and that's how we learned about, through people who love surfing.
Viewing the tour, one can say that you have been making great shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for the presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never played there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs of each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How come?
I think it's partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's difficult to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not been playing for a while, this keeps us focused and keeps us surprised because it reminds us the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for the people.
With this tour, you are celebrating 20 years of experience.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all you have made?
Yes, absolutely.
First, I think none of us could ever imagine we'd be in a rock band and doing this for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue making music together.
We all love each other and love making music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
Things could not be better for us.
What does it mean for you having been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be a part of that group of great bands.
We are good friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is unusual.
From time to time, arises a band of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come out at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in its tour, so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them and we are honored to be part of the Seattle sound that aroused.
It is also very strange that a band like yours remains united with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands lasted.
First, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we all care about the others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, there have also been opened musical avenues that give each the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with the music of each and this could not be better.
Your relationship to the word fame has not been easy; but thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We take care of not being too much on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without setting your mind on being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project Manother Love Bone?
I think we write very good songs and at the beginning was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations because lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still close friends of Bruce (Fair-weather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made ​​me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
It was a remarkable man and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know its work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us several videos proposals and that was the band that we liked most, so we're anxious to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
He sings it and I think he does this with the first thing that comes to his mind.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Within the first that come to my mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ...
There are so many I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeeded to maintain grunge relevant despite of not being any longer a fad?
I think all of us feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came at the same time, and if it is important now, I think it's wonderful because it is music worth listening to and bands as Mudhoney are making now music better than ever.
At first, your music had a darker content, and now has become more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the album that may appear lighter, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are qualified as very dark although they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them, I cried when I heard them, and these songs are profoundly dark.
I think that when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these two songs certainly represent that for me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
