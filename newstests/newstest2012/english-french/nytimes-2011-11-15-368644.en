Mass Slaughter on a Personal Level
Peter Englund's intense and bighearted new book, "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War," begins with a long dramatis personae of the sort that can make your heart sink. 
Here is advice for proceeding: Gently excise this page and make it your bookmark.
You will be getting to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novelistic telling, and this dramatis personae will function as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of his men and women, you are confused and bereft in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, one he describes, not inaccurately, as "a work of anti-history."
It contains few big names, major treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, dashing journalists or discussions of tactics and materiel.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about what it was like." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"The Beauty and the Sorrow" threads together the wartime experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and clerks.
A few of these people will become heroes.
A few will become prisoners of war, or lose limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flicker here like votive candles lighted in a church; new ones are added to the mix while some wink out.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is a corrective too to the notion that World War I was only about the dire trench warfare on the Western Front.
"The Beauty and the Sorrow" expertly pans across other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book have beehives fall on them; one has Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the start.
War floods these people's lives like a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordite.
When cannon fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman at home with your children, do you stay or flee?
Who is coming, anyway?
Almost no one understands what's happening, even why this war is to be fought.
"Lack of facts," Mr. Englund observes, "has been padded out with guesses, suppositions, hopes, fears, id√©es fixes, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The Beauty and the Sorrow" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German high-seas fleet seaman.
Their stories are mostly taken from memoirs, letters and other already published material.
The accounts of their lives can be terrifying or stirring, but are most fully alive in Mr. Englund's accumulation of small moments, stray details.
Many of these are about deprivation and making do.
In telling a German schoolgirl's story he says: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Substitute coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes on about the ersatz food in Germany.
He describes "meat made of pressed rice boiled in mutton fat (and finished off with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato peel; shoes soled with wood."
There are, he notes, "837 registered meat substitutes permissible in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American recognizes his own impulse toward savagery and declares about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men were intended for rather than to sit in easy chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, the evening paper or the best seller, and to pretend that such a veneer means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind your starched and studded shirt front."
Conversely a British soldier realizes that he will most likely die, and that no one will notice or care.
"Once one is resigned to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that it might happen in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is horribly like "a condemned man being strangled secretly."
Other observations are about an old Europe falling away, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Mr. Englund writes, "a war between factories."
He catches the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the articulate and ideologically convinced mass murderer in well-cut clothes who performs his butchery while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unanticipated ways; there is as much base behavior as heroism.
Mr. Englund discussed the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and smear into their genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital," he writes.
"Those who are really desperate rub it into their eyes, which often results in lifelong blindness."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is supple but unshowy, perfectly suited to his humane task.
In dozens of small scenes he catches the way the war has "unleashed uniquely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People begin to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been oblique, like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory," or novels, like Erich Maria Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front," rather than comprehensive histories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has the most devastating ending I can remember in a piece of nonfiction.
I won't give it away.
But it's as if he has reached from his book, snatched that dramatis personae page from your fingers, and lighted it with a match.
