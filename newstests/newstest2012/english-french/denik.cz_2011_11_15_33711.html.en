Development of Trip Prices Since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in the former Czechoslovakia: ÄŒedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea, and Autoturist.
As travelling to the West was strictly limited, travel agencies of the time mostly sold tours to the socialist block countries.
For their holiday, Czech tourists thus went to the sea to the German Democratic Republic; Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea near the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both to the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, the Yugoslavian regime turned West, which caused significant limitations to trips to Yugoslavia for Czech tourists.
A great paradox of the socialistic period was that citizens of the socialist block (i.e. Czechoslovaks too) were not allowed free individual travel within the socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel, as an individual, to, for example, the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from the country was necessary; otherwise, individual travel was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies would offer some trips to the West, but one either had to stand in a line overnight, with a sleeping bag or have some "good friends" in the agency.
Still, that was not all.
A foreign currency assurance was essential for travels to the West. It was not granted to politically unreliable people, who were not allowed to travel at all.
Czechoslovakian currency was not freely convertible; without the currency assurance, it was not possible to obtain financial means (Western currency) for travelling West.
Most often, Czechs spent their holiday at home, which resulted in great number of cottages and summer houses, a habit that survives until now.
Since 1989, Czech tourism thus experienced a real revolution.
While until 1989, a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the climax of our travels, last year, Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries all over the world.
A great paradox we do not realise anymore is that until 1989, we could not freely visit the currently most popular Croatia, as it was part of former Yugoslavia.
Right at the beginning of 1990, visa requirements for neighbouring West European countries were cancelled. This started a huge wave of short-term visits of chiefly Vienna and Germany.
Czechoslovaks could not get enough of travelling to the West. Everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tours slept in parks in tents, because their income at the time was not enough to pay for a hotel or a pension.
A typical feature of Czech tourism then was bringing their own food (cans, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible Czech Crown. After decades, our tourists thus finally able to freely buy Western currencies.
Our living standards and average income were growing, which, around 1997, resulted in another important moment.
Since 1997, increased demand allowed travel agencies to prepare regular trips by charter airlines. Compared to the past, air trips thus became unbelievably cheap due to the ability to order quantity discounts.
By the end of 1990s, Czechs did not need visa for visiting nearly all developed world countries, except for the USA. This made our travelling even easier.
The next significant event in the history of after revolution travelling came in 2000. High demand resulted in the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights take Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter, flights from the Czech Republic will reach twelve exotic destinations.
Currently about 100 thousand Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Yet another important event of this period, symbolising our development after the revolution, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the USA removed visa requirements for Czech tourists. Our country has thus permanently joined the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in history, in 2008 Czechs spent more than a half of their holidays abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history, they spent over 15 thousand Crowns per person per holiday abroad, including their costs at the destination.
