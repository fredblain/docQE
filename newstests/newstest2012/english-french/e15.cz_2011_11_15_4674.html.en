Brand Story:
The IMB Innovator Starts the Second Century of Its Existence
Should someone search for the word that would best express the IMB strategy, the closest one would probably be "long-term."
To the wide public, IMB is a symbol of technological revolution; the company is seen as a highly temporary one, yet it was founded over a hundred years ago.
The company's durability goes back to its first boss, a visionary, Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He believed in his motto saying that numerous world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto: 'Think!' thus become an imprint around which the life of the future giant would unfold (as well as the name of its internal magazine that IMB started to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of company culture Watson was building carefully.
"For us in IMB, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IMB survived and flourished for a hundred years, because it remained true to its original values, while it was not afraid to change everything around itself.
During our first century, this allowed us to transform the technology, business, and the company.
In the second century, we hope to be able to achieve even more," says current company Director, Samuel J. Palmisano, on the occasion of the anniversary.
Sophisticated System
In the 1930s, Watson approached employee care similarly to Ba≈•a in the Czech Republic - people from IMB were among the first American employees to have a paid holiday, insurance from their employer, an elegant uniform, and a sophisticated system of bonuses for the best inventors and businessmen.
Just as sophisticated is IBM's long-term relationship with customers.
From the very beginning, the company was brilliant in exploiting talented people. It was one of the first world companies to abolish all discrimination, which rendered it with great selection.
Consistent with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan expecting a woman, Virginia Rometty, to take over after Palmisano next year.
She has been working in IMB for thirty years; she is currently a Director of Sales, Marketing, and Strategy.
In the last few years, IMB has been organising jams, on-line brainstorming sessions, from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
It is no surprise that the ideas are plentiful - the company employs nearly half a million people.
Institution with a Good Reputation
Company's strong business position is ensured by its strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, the concept of IBM was that of an institution rather than a technology company,' a Harvard Business School Professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, told the Economist.
"IBM is not a technology firm; it is a company that helps to solve business problems using technology," George Colony of Forrester Research consultation company adds.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering a market and creating it.
During the hundred years, IMB, or the "Big Blue," as it is called in the US because of its logo, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting; and consultation services within a range from servers to nanotechnologies.
It holds the most patents of all American technology companies; five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Price.
Its inventions include, for example, the cash point, pay card, financial swap, bar code, and floppy disc.
With about 220 billion dollars, based on market capitalisation, IBM has become the second largest technology company (Apple being number one) this year, overrunning Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
View Ahead
Not all of its products fitted the taste of both the customers and period. For example, IBM failed with its own operating system OS/2; Prodigy on-line services; and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is defined by movement forward, you cannot be emotionally attached to the past,' says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM easily builds its foundations on many platforms - if they do not work, it leaves them.
This is how it differs from, for example, its competitor, Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on Windows, its operating system.
Perspective Technology
IBM's revenues chiefly consist of services, about one fifth for each comes from software and hardware.
While in 1990, with over a half share, it was the strongest hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low profitable assets worth 15 billion dollars. During the same time, it has invested 58 billion dollars into purchasing of perspective technologies.
It has continued the investments even after 2008, when the modern economic crisis first hit the world.
IBM follows the legacy of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the amount of investments during the Great Depression.
So far, IMB seems to be getting through the current crisis without any harm.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM's shares has grown by remarkable 120 per cent; company's net earnings have been growing continuously.
IBM's company motto is to change everything, except for its values.
We may therefore expect that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will manage.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter To Space Travel
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York, a hundred years ago. Its original name "Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation" was quite complicated.
It took the name of IBM in 1924. Originally, this was a brand used for company's branches in Canada and South America.
Foundations for the later IBM were laid by a merger of four companies, the history of which goes back to the 1880s.
They owned technologies such as the legendary "time clock," i.e. a clock recording the time when employees arrive and leave work.
The architect of the new company was a businessman, Charles Ranlett Flint, who, until 1930, also presided over the company's Board of Trustees.
Flint hired a director of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with company management.
The leader then put the IBM's founder in the shade - Watson's ideas remain the base for invincible company culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started by producing and selling various business machines - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, the revenue doubled to nine million dollars, and company's vast expansion into all continents commenced.
Watson became so essential for the company, that after nearly forty years, his position in the director's chair was taken by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM started to develop artificial intelligence and created the first programming language.
In 1960s, both people and computers from IBM helped NASA control space flights - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, man's flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC that defined the computer standards of the period, called IBM 5150, came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computer production to a Chinese company, Lenovo, While buying the consultant division of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and thus commenced its full focus on consulting and high added value services.
In the past three years, IBM has been highly successful with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its goal is both smart exploitation of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned for and improving the situation in traffic or town management.
For commerce, IBM has recently introduced a Smarter Commerce platform that helps businessmen control the whole commerce cycle.
IBM's history is strong even in our country.
In former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in both Central and Eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also runs a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for both Central and Eastern Europe resides in Prague, where there also is a world level research team focusing on voice recognition.
