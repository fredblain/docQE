Japan reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and puts an end to the downward spiral that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake, resulting in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe suffered by the Nippon country since the Second World War.
The first estimates of Tokyo government regarding the material losses amounted to $ 300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have dimmed.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September helped to turn the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annualized rate.
The one recorded in the second quarter, for the Japanese the Fiscal Year begins in March 2012 - represents also the fastest rhythm of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the recovery in the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the following tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% versus 0.9% decline in capital expenditures which was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the true revulsion of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites taking advantage on the crisis to strengthen-or rebuild-infrastructure, using of gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, especially thanks to the evolution of the household consumption, which now represents 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, driven by the increase of expenditure for cars, travels and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted to the internal market, when the yen-the Nippon currency has become one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors who wanted to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro area and the negative forecasts of the U.S., a privilege that weighs like a stone in the accounts of export companies.
With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious slap for a country whose economic line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed the yen for their weak results between July and September.
As markets continue their siege of the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard.
"We must be vigilant to the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD) said that most member countries showed in September clear signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the global economy showed that the major powers are slowing.
Since it fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone even fell below the average, which is at the level of 100, since it rushed eight tenths up to 99.13 points.
