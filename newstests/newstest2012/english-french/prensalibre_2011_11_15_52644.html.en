The mustachioed plumber comes to be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil clutches of Bowser, but never before he had done this in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives in the stores around the world this month, has been designed to exploit the features of the potable console Nintendo 3DS, which allows playing in three dimensions without the need of using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how it should work the stereoscopy without glasses," said the press head of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for this support," because until now successes like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo spokesman has claimed that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game which allows enjoying a quick and fluid game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
Once pasted, most experts will give a "second round" to the levels of the play, which this time, are more difficult.
In addition, the users can choose in real-time between "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but will need to be played in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and "not to succumb optical illusions."
This incursion of Super Mario in three dimensions represents also the return of the character to a portable console, fact that has not occurred since 2005.
In this game Nintendo winks to the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula of the previous games, the plumber with mustache will have to go through dangerous mined platforms in order to free princess Peach.
Although the player will find new movements, the surroundings, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
