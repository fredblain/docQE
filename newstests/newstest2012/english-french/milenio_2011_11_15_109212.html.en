Wednesday there will be formed the new Italian government
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put the country on the edge of an economic disaster
The designated Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put Italy on the edge of an economic disaster and has endangered the entire euro zone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, named on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed largely of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will undertake the position.
Monti said the he will present to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country of getting out of this difficult phase," said the former European commissioner to the reporters.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "framework is now well delineated," he said.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than the normal, while Italy fought a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by the European leaders in order to regain the confidence in Italy.
Underlying the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instable markets put the yield of the Italian BTP bonds to 10-year above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers' Federation told the reporters after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support very much this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were considerably boosted by the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good outcome," said to the reporters Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the government majority made of technocrats that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have a strong parliamentary support for applying the reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began on Monday his consultations with the political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women organizations.
He will end his meeting on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief rest at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the Italian debt costs have now reached critical levels between uncertainties about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion Euros would be too much for the current financial defenses of the euro zone.
Monti has said that his government would last until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite the widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before moving forward with the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be made only of technicians, an indication of his objections to a process forced by the financial pressure.
Political sources said that the mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
