Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the extradition process of the ex leader Alfonso Portillo has begun in order to respond in the United States of laundering $ 70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of north country that claimed for Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision is according to the independence of judiciary and executive powers, taking into account that a trial court had already ordered the extradition.
He stated that during his mandate he did not "put his hands" in judicial decisions and accepted all extradition proceedings he has ever known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug traffic.
What's done by Colom represents an executive process after getting exhausted all legal and constitutional courts to prosecute the ex head of state between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzlement of Q120 million in the Defense Ministry when he was a president, which was the process that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reopened the case.
