Chip maps without contacts become generalised
The worldwide chip map room opens on Tuesday at Villepinte near Paris, in an optimistic atmosphere.
The year 2011 should actually end on an 11% rise of worldwide sales of microprocessors (Bank cards, telephones with a SIM card ...), with over 6 thousand million units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important sector is that of contactless technology, which enables paying for common transport or paying for purchases simply by passing the card over a reader.
This year, 460 million of contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide, as against 320 millions a year earlier!
Their share will progress in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent almost 10% of the global market of chip cards (6,925 million cards).
For a long time, lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is now gaining ground in contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75 000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the start is more modest; 400.000 contactless Visa card are in use.
But the large stores are installing superfast slots.
This year, Carrefour issued 2,5 million contactless MasterCards.
To achieve higher speeds, it is now necessary to equip their clients.
"Two large French establishments have undertaken to distribute systematically in future to their clients, bank cards equipped for contactless use, announces Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payment by mobile telephone
But this is only a first stage of the future mode of payment, namely, the mobile telephone.
Few apparatus are at present equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication, essential for implementing these transactions.
"They have been delayed.
"But they should really take wing next year."
"We are counting on a worldwide sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012, explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are forging ahead.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced a test to run from next December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 clients and collaborators are going to be equipped to authorise contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and in Marseille.
And the Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing the market launch of an offer enabling its clients to pay via their mobiles.
