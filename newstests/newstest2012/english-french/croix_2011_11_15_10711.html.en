Why is the rate of unemployment of handicapped workers so high?
Some 19% of handicapped persons are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of the handicapped starts today.
Despite a public voluntary policy introduced in 2005, the rate of unemployment of the handicapped is still twice as high as the average, namely 19%, versus 9% for the population as a whole.
Discouraging?
"No, stresses Eric Blanchet, Director-General of Adapt, the association which organises the week for the employment of the handicapped."
"The progress achieved since 15 years ago is considerable."
"At that time the rate of unemployment was not 2x but 3x as high."
"There is however still a huge amount to do."
It must be said that for the handicapped, the obstacles to obtaining employment are still many.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 (17% on average).
They have rather a low level of qualifications; 80% do not have the "bac" and out of the 2.3 million students in higher education only 10 000 are handicapped.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very widespread, being 85% for the handicapped versus 38% on an average.
Briefly, all these are criteria which greatly complicate a return to employment and which constitute the nub of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, director-general of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies to recruit handicapped workers.
Here are some of the brakes.
It is hardly necessary to speak about mentalities, which do change, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cit√© showed that the managers questioned had a low level of knowledge of handicap," with an "over-representation of persons in wheelchairs, psychically or intellectually deficient persons."
Result - private companies employing over 20 persons are still far from achieving the objective of employing the 6% of handicapped workers, fixed by a law dating back to 1987.
The latter known figures dating to 2008 have a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now on around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, director-general of the Agefiph, the organisation responsible for collecting contributions from companies which do not observe this law.
Proof: The number of "taxed" establishments, like the sums paid, have fallen between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million Euros).
"The law of 2005, which raised the contributions, created a strong pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also reflects a rise of consciousness, in particular within large groups."
According to the ministry of employment, only 59% of establishments employing between 20 and 49 handicapped persons, versus 82% of companies employing between 100 and 199 persons.
