Inscription of a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution
The government of the great social democratic /Christian democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budgetary "golden rule" into the constitution, in order to reduce public deficits and so avoid a possible downgrading by rating agencies of Austria's sovereign credit rsting (triple A).
It was the social-democratic Chancellor his elf, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision at the end of a meeting of the council of ministers, with the Austrian public debt at 74,6%, much higher than the norm of a maximum of 60% set by the treaty of Maastricht, but below the public debt of countries like Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria had not fallen by a single notch,from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three thousand million Euros of interest more every year," argued the vice-chancellor and Christian democratic foreign minister, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus complies with a request from the Brussels summit of member-States of Eurozone on 26 October; the heads of State and government requested a reduction by the end of 2102 of public deficits and a return to balanced public accounts in the constitution or in a law to the same effect.
The dispositions adopted by the Austrian government approach the "German model," being the first European country to adopt this "rule."
By 2017, the public structural deficit must fall by 0.75% of the PIB) and from 2017, the structural public deficit of the Austrian Federal State must not exceed 0,35% of PIB in any year, whilst the LÃ¤nder, as well as communities, must submit balanced budgets.
The objective is that of making public debt fall below the 60% criterion fixed by the treaty of Maastricht by 2020/2021.
