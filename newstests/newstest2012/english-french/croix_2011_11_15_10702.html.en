The North Stream, a new portal for the entry of Russian gas into Europe
The North Stream gasduct connecting Western Europe and Russia directly along the bottom of the Baltic sea, has been commissioned.
It is scheduled to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the giant Russian gas producer, wanted to celebrate the event with a "bang."
Over 500 guests including four heads of State and of government took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between an orchestral performance and a fine buffet, in the inauguration of North Stream, the new gasduct, which directly links Russia and Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, the French prime minister François Fillon and his Dutch opposite number Mark Rutte jointly turned the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network.
With this new gasduct, 27,5 thousand million additional cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe via a first pipeline of 1 224 km linking the region of Saint Petersburg to the Land of Mecklemburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline is due to be ready by the end of 2012, making it possible to deliver a total of 55 thousand million cubic metres of gas, the equivalent of the entire French consumption.
And the possibility of constructing a third pipeline of the same course is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the completion on time of this huge project is a victory.
The project was fiercely competed for by Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will in fact allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any passage via a third country (Poland or the Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: it will become more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to close access to West European markets.
At the most critical point of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare North Stream new "German-Soviet pact," referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is to say that the topic is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is gaining greater security for its supplies.
But at the price of depriving Europe of energy, since the project has created a breach between eastern and western Europe.
Russia has succeeded in less than five years, in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the the rich Western countries, which consume large quantities of gas, and whose deposits are declining.
"This gasduct is a component of partnership with Russia, it is a new artery which links us organically," confirmed François Fillon inaugurating the gasduct, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both politically and economically important.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, present in large numbers at Lubmin, the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gasduct is also a technical exploit.
The undersea pipeline is made of steel embedded in concrete, in order to protect it from ships' anchors.
Ir rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 metres.
To construct it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesman of North Stream company.
It was also necessary to multiply steps of protecting the fauna and the flora.
The pipeline is a long metal serpent, of weight equivalent to that of 242 Eiffel towers, with no breaks throughout its length, no valves and no maintenance stations.
A control platform was provided on the level of Sweden, but the project managers abandoned it since the Swedes were not keen on seeing a Russian State company becoming permanently on its shores.
"In case of accident we stop the passage of gas for at least one minute," states Jens Müller.
In the case of a leak, the gas contained in the gasduct therefore escapes into the air.
But this is thought to be unlikely by the constructors who provided welds to leak only every 100 000 years.
The surveillance of the state of the gasduct is provided by an undersea robot, pulled by a ship for outside observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating within the gasduct.
Being cigar-shaped, it is introduced inside the 1-metre wide pipeline, and it is pushed along by the gas.
On arrival after 3 complete days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it delivers precise information concerning any metal deformation.
The gasduct was designed to work for 50 years without any need for even the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is implemented simply by its pressure.
This is 200 bar on leaving and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies combined their forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shareholding.
The others are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and the Dutch Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint enterprise called North Stream, delegated to construct and to operate the gasduct.
It has its headquarters at Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom next leased to this company for twenty renewable years,the entire capacity of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, whatever may be the quantity of gas actually transported," states Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gasduct was provided to the extent of 30% by the shareholders and of 70% by Bank loans.
The total cost of the works will be 7.4 thousand million Euros for the two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 millions.
But the minority shareholders are certain to recover their costs, since Gazprom assumes the entire risk.
The gasduct emerges from the Baltic sea at Lubmin on a sandy littoral planted with conifers.
4.5 metre high valves form the gas exit.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and the specific gravities of arriving gas before being transferred into German gasducts.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, this will be 3 million an hour and in 2012, 6 million.
