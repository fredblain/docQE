Portugal is very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento starts its return match against Bosnia (22h00) very optimistically, this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On their way there, both teams appeared to lack realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and in the Ukraine.
For him there is not a shadow of a doubt, the Selection, with which he has been at odds since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is match to play and an opponent, Bosnia to conquer.
In view of the (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica it is clear that the games are not over.
Whilst Portugal dominated the match for over one hour, it was not able to reach this precious target, which would have consoled it.
"It is a good result, which nevertheless involves a certain risk"
But on their side, in their illuminated Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they are playing in front of a public which must be enthusiastic, even if the match is very close," said an optimistic, but lucid, Bento
"We are expecting a very close match, but we are convinced that we can win, declared the Portuguese trainer aged 42.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," even under the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The zero taken on Friday from Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to win.
A zero may be sufficient for the Bosnians.
"It is a good result, which nevertheless carries some risk, regrets Bento.
"We are going to play a team which has many technical qualities and which has players possessing many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese would plan to exert maximal pressure on the Bosnians from the start, to "give them no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it will, prove realistic this time.
