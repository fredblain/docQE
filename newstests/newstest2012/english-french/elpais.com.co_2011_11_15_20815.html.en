Such was the work of the person who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali lophoscopist entered into history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is a key work.
On November 4th the lophoscopist of Cali CTI passed into history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC top leader, "Alfonso Cano, through the comparison of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the branch of CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability' for Eleazar Gonzalez, a man of Puerto Tejada, who had spent 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go for more than five days in the jungle to reach the place where there were the bodies that should be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after making the corresponding courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of skin friction, meaning the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of Eliazar's operation against alias Alfonso Cano he was warned to take clothes only for three days.
Something big was coming.
On Friday night he went from Cauca with a helicopter, to Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two corpses and one was suspected to be of the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so they asked him to take the ten print card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team to the site where the body was, he did not recognize him by his physical appearance; it was very different from that seen in the media.
He was without beard, dressed as a farmer of the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints do not lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a paddle and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano'.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was the top leader of the FARC.
In search of the fingerprint
For a fingerprint specialist from Sijin of Cali the recognition made ​​by the President Juan Manuel Santos to Eleazar Gonzalez in the press conference for the operation against "Cano', is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
The fingerprinting science is an exact science, without error, which can be key solution in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of bodies, the fingerprinting specialists support research for crimes like theft and murder and confirm the identity of those captured.
When captured, many criminals have fake cards or do not have papers.
We will take their fingerprint and seek them in the database.
The researcher said that, in a case of theft, he had to remove a piece of the wall of a house because in that place the thief had supported his hand on to take a safe full of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a print, but in this case we could get the print of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in several robberies" he said.
The prints can also rule out or confirm suspects in murder cases.
They have recently found a dead man, with liquor bottles around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a print on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it was the murderer, it places him it in the murder scene.
A fingerprint expert of CTI explained that in objects "footprints are drawn with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear there is used a paddle or tape to lift them.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or at the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in CSI television program.
Just as not everything that glitters is gold, not everything you touch turns into a footprint.
However, if it can be used, the comparison is being made.
