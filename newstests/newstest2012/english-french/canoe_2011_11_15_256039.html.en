Twitter modifies its platform and resembles Facebook
On Monday, the microblog site Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of those whom they are monitoring, which makes its service resemble that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" make it possible to follow more legibly and directly the activity of other "Twitters," the internet navigators whose messages are monitored ("tweets") and of those who monitor you.
This enables one to know if they cause messages to be monitored, if they subscribe new accounts, if they have favourite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August"before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, indicated a spokeswoman of Twitter, Carolyn Penner to AFP.
Twitter, which has been known so far for being rather unintuitive, and for its use of somewhat esoteric terms (RT for re-posting someone else's message, #followfriday for recommending following other users), much to the delight of experienced users, is thus opening itself to a wider audience by offering a user experience closer to those of popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users debated this innovation via "tweets" on internet.
"It is useless, invasive and resembles Facebook excessively"
"The functionality activity will help me to monitor better certain elements of my Twitter flow," sent @dannykronstrom.
