An occupied farm where macro parties were given was evacuated
The invaders had seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without a fight
It seems that the nightmare lived by the neighbors residing in 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left voluntarily yesterday at noon the property they were illegally occupying, and where they organized macro parties that exasperated the neighborhood, by court order without police intervention.
When the operation was finished the lock on the door was changed in order to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be an access control," said the manager.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest are inhabited- took all the wiring and part of the water, painted the walls and left residues of all kinds, especially alcoholic beverage cans.
The first three floors were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and exasperated the tenants.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat told to Europa Press that since the building was occupied her business went down 80%.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the farm made ​​her an unfair competition, since they were selling drinks for three Euros, while in the club worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the disco had to respond to neighborhood complaints of noise, while, as she noted, the noise was not caused by customers of the club, but by the inhabitants of the squat and, above all, those attending the parties that were organized there, which had increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks, as the angry neighbors said.
The head of the club said that the discomfort was so great that even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and there are now nine months since she "forgives" him for paying the rent.
The City Police also confirmed that in recent weeks has received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, of the council Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately evacuate the building in order to solve the problems of coexistence and community spirit caused to neighbors, and the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the squatters had entered into all floors and in almost every floor and that in some of them occurred burglaries.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be strongly against the incivility that has been generated on the farm."
Also yesterday, the members of the police evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30 the police went to 35 Montral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had noticed that four people had entered the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
