Bush snatches an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians 
The president George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, in Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally reached their accord on a common declaration. 
He stated that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas agreed to begin immediate negotiations for finding a final settlement of the 60-year-old contention between their two people. 
In the presence of the two men, Bush has promised to do everything to help them concluding a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008. 
In the meantime, Palestinians have to demolish "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel has to stop its settlement activities, declared Bush, reminding both parties their obligations towards the peace "roadmap" they've accepted in 2003. 
The head of the White House emphasized that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim at "the conclusion of a peace treaty solving every outstanding issue, without any exception, central issues included". 
This term covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the contentious between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in the current State of Israel during the conflict of 1948. 
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted on future "global and in-depth" negotiations which will be based on a regulation, mentioning among others "Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the settlements, the water and the security". 
At his turn to speak, Olmert committed himself to future "direct and continuous" negotiations and to make an effort to end them in 2008. 
Bush set at the end of 2008 the deadline for implementing his "vision of two coexisting states" of Israel and Palestine. 
Saudi Arabia revealed that it secured a commitment from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference. 
Charged by all Arabic conutries, Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its own territories occupied during the 1967's war, East-Jerusalem included. 
Annapolis marks "a crossroad in the Middle-East history, particularly because it faces the conflict's roots and its central aspects", Prince Saud says in his interview with an Arabic newspaper.
