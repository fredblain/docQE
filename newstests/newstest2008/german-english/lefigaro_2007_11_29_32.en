This estimate takes into consideration the unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as the unplanned births. 
Different contraceptives, such as the pill or the coil, have a failure rate which is still between 5% and 6%, estimated the Ined. 
In spite of that, the legalization of the contraception leaded to a better «fertility control», expliques the Institute according to which the rate of the pill's use among women between 20 and 44 years old has nowadays risen to 60 %, against 5 % in 1970. 
Finally, nowadays eight births out of ten would be well planned. 
One couple out of five would even plan the birth's month, choosing when possible the springtime, considered the best period for having a child.
