The EU is the major trading partner of India and represents the 18% of its foreign trade. 
The EU is also its major foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trade partner of the EU, according to data of the European Commission. 
"A free trade pact will considerably improve both economies" and "India would improve his access to a trade of 450 millions reach Europeans" justifies Peter Mandelson. 
Europe represents the major or the second trade for all the first ten products exported by India, states the European Commissioner. The Asian and the European giants exchange every year "47 milliards goods" and "ten milliards euros of services", declared this week Danièle Smadja,leader of the European Commission in New Delhi, expressing her regret because the bilateral trade "hasn't still reached its potential". The EU and India will meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi, in the presence of the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the president of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.
