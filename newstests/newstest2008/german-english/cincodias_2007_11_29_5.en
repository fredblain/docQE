Popular will open its 200 offices for 12 hours daily from Monday to Saturday 
Popular has decided to renew a large part of their offices. 
In total 200, located in the most commercial zones of Spain. 
These branches will operate under the mark Popular Max and represent a big change for the bank. 
This is also true for the rest of the Spanish banks, since this is the first group to decide to bet on an all-day aperture for their offices, until 20.30 in the evening, and open on Saturdays from 1000 to 2030 hours. 
Another group that has also reiterated in several occasions that it wanted to extend the opening times of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to make the move. 
While, it's near to closing an agreement with the unions who insist on the closure of 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening late, although not to the public. 
Results from Popular's experience will be decisive for other banks to follow the initiative, depending on commercial hours. 
Indeed this is the objective that Popular is chasing with this project. 
To catch the particular clients that circulate in these zones to make their purchases, to SMEs, the independent and commercial sales of the chosen streets to open. 
The bank needs to have these 200 offices open in all Spain within 18 months, since they are not building new offices but remodelling existing ones. 
For that, the organization will modernize the branches that it already has in commercial zones, adapting them to the clients profile of the different streets. 
In this way, the extension of the opening times is accompanied by a different space concept of the branch and a new design with more luminous colours. 
The manager of the commercial bank Angel Creek assures that this reconstruction does not require a great investment, although an increase in personnel is required since one needs to go from about six employees at the premises to eight or nine. 
The offices, that will even have meeting rooms for SMEs, will not sell financial products. 
One positive experience for the group. 
Popular has tested its initiative on three offices in Madrid. 
And it has been a positive experience, according to √Ångel Rivero's explanation. 
Branches of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via streets of Madrid have been chosen, and it seems with success according to Rivero. 
Today Popular accounts for 2500 branches. 
And another 60 operate through the Mundocredit trademark, specifically for immigrants, which have increased opening times, and even open on Sundays and holidays. 
In these PopularMax offices they don't replicate the BBVA model, where several of their offices count on a great variety of non financial products for their commerce. 
"We don't want to compete with our clients", says Rivero. 
At present, they have agreed with Telefonica to sell cell phones, with personnel outside the bank.
