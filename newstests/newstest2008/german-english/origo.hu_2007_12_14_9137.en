Forces for a huge strike come together 
On Friday, the Liga Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Councils (MOSZ) will put together a strike committee charged with coordinating an open-ended strike set to start on Monday. 
They plan to hold a protest rally on Saturday and on Monday - the day parliament is scheduled to vote a health insurance bill into law - they will begin their work stoppage. 
The strike is certain to snarl the transport network, for rail traffic will come to a more or less complete halt and Budapest public transport will be frozen until 1.00 p.m.. 
Liga and the Workers' Council federation will publicize details of their jointly organized Monday walkout on Friday afternoon.. 
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is being set up to coordinate Monday's industrial action. 
Organizers plan to hold a public protest demonstration on Saturday, and the organizations joining the strike will begin an open-ended work stoppage on Monday unless they can come to prior agreement with the government. 
What this means is that they have not set a termination date for the walkout, beginning as of the day parliament adopts the health insurance bill. 
If by some chance parliament fails to adopt the health insurance law, the unions will immediately retract their strike appeal. 
If they adopt the bill, the strike committees will meet and decide on their next moves. 
Given parliament's agenda for Monday, it is conceivable that the health insurance bill may not come up for a vote until evening or possibly not until late at night. 
The strike that gets underway on Monday is certain to create significant delays in the transport system. The railways will stop running for an open-ended period of time, while a portion of Budapest public transport might be halted through noon, as might over half of the long-distance bus lines. 
At the same time, there will be partial roadblocks on many of the nation's highways. 
Many unions and civic organizations have responded to the strike appeal. A complete and regularly updated list of them is available on Liga's website. 
Some organizations have announced open-ended strikes, while others are limiting themselves to temporary work stoppages. 
As of Thursday afternoon no agreement had been reached between Hungarian railways M√ÅV and the Railway Workers' Free Trade Union (VDSZSZ), not even on minimum services, despite the fact that a growing number of people plan to travel by rail as the Christmas holidays approach.. 
According to latest reports, the Budapest Transport Company will be out from the start of business till 1 p.m., Budapest Airport will halt work from 7 to 9 a.m., Liga's Power and Thermal Energy Unions will walk off the job for 4 hours, while the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Union of Teachers will hold 2-hours and 2-8 hour walkouts. 
The National Federation of Physicians will hold a nationwide strike over staggered hours while the Democratic Union of Healthcare and Welfare Workers (EDDSZ), a part of the umbrella Union Cooperation Forum (SZEF), plans a two-hour warning strike. 
The most important of Liga's four demands is that the government repeal its health insurance reform bill and submit a new concept for society-wide debate. 
The second demand is that the new method for calculating pensions due to begin next year be introduced gradually instead of all at once. 
The third is that when determining the occupations eligible for early retirement, the jobs to be included in the option be chosen before 2010. 
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Railway Workers' Free Trade Union (VDSZSZ), a Liga union, rejected the offer submitted by the Economic and Transport Ministry on spur lines and wants it to make a new offer.
