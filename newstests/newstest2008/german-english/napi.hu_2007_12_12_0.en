Food: Where European inflation slipped up 
The skyward zoom in food prices is the dominant force behind the speed up in eurozone inflation. 
November price hikes were higher than expected in the 13 eurozone countries, with October's 2.6 percent yr/yr inflation rate followed by 3.1 percent in November, the EU's Luxembourg-based statistical office reported. 
Official forecasts predicted just 3 percent, Bloomberg said. 
As opposed to the US, UK, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut interest rates, arguing that a rate drop combined with rising raw material prices and declining unemployment would trigger an inflationary spiral. 
The ECB wants to hold inflation to under two percent, or somewhere in that vicinity. 
According to one analyst, ECB a has been caught in a Catch-22: It needs to "talk down" inflation, to keep from having to take action to push it down later in the game. 
Germany's November inflation rate of 3.3 percent counts as a record; in Spain the rate shot up to 4.1 percent from an earlier 3.6. 
Soaring food and energy prices sent eurozone inflation into the stratosphere. 
Wheat futures were up by 88 percent and soybean prices were at their highest since 1973. 
Consumers also have had to pay significantly more for vegetable oils and dairy products in 2007. 
The world market price of crude oil shot up by 52 percent this year, with the black gold costing nearly 100 dollars a barrel last month. 
The ECB predicts that 2008 inflation will climb to 2.5 percent from the earlier 2.1, but will drop back to 1.9 percent in 2009. 
Analysts see the 12-month inflation rate as holding steady at about 3 percent over the next 3-4 months, but say that the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent. 
They also predict that the ECB will cut interest rates twice during the course of 2008.
