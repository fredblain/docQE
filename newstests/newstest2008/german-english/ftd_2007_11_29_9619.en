Chávez Turns Back Clocks 
In Venezuela, times are about to change. 
President Hugo Chávez has decreed that time-pieces in the South American country be turned back by half an hour on December 9. 
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a figure of ridicule. 
According to the Official Gazette of Venezuela, a new law decrees that clocks be set to GMT minus four and a half hours. 
Thereby, the South American state creates its own time zone that does not apply to any other country in the world. 
Chávez, whose disposition towards the US has been hostile, cited a number of reasons for his decision. Notably, he alleged that the worlds division into time zones according to full clock hours was an imposition by the United States. 
On Wednesday (local time), Chávez also announced a severance of diplomatic ties with neighboring country Colombia due to a hostage crisis. 
As long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, the left-wing nationalist said, he would not entertain relations with Colombias head of state, nor with its government. 
My dignity does not permit it, said Chávez. He is pushing for a constitutional reform on which citizens of the petroleum-exporting country get to vote in a referendum on Sunday. 
The reform would provide a significant extension of his domestic power. 
The dispute was caused by Uribes decision to revoke Chávezs mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia. 
Uribes decision was a slap in the face for Venezuela, Chávez had complained on Sunday. 
Chávez is the talk of the town in Spain, as well. 
A new ringtone for cell phones is causing a furor in the country: Por qué no te callas (Why dont you shut your mouth), says the line that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet. 
It was spoken by King Juan Carlos of Spain. Annoyed by the left-wing populists incessant interjections, Juan Carlos had rebuked him at the most recent Ibero-American Summit.
