Allies in Afghanistan Passive, Americans Say 
According to the U.S., the low number of soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment is influencing the course of the mission in Afghanistan. 
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should design a concrete plan for the following years. 
The mission in Afghanistan is not proceeding according to the original concept, the representatives of the countries which have posted units in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland. 
In addition to the growing reluctance of the Taliban movement, eight participant states will also discuss other plans and the coordination of the allies today. 
Whereas the U.S. ordered the NATO units through the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to increase activity this week, Great Britain sees the priority in the reinforcement of the Afghan government authority and the intensification of developmental aid. 
"The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but armed forces can only be part of the solution. 
The other is to let the inhabitants begin further expansion of the economy and security themselves," the British Secretary of Defence Des Browne told the BBC. 
Ninety Percent 
According to data from the U.S. Army, the activity of the Afghan rebels is the greatest in the last five years. 
The number of violent acts rose 27 percent compared with last year, as much as 60 percent in the southern Helmand province. 
The NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of whom are in the southern territory. 
But according to the U.S., the allies have reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the units. 
They are specifically asking for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts on Afghan unit training. 
"We will have to think hard about the concrete goals for the coming era and the ways to reach them," said Gates. 
The Secretary General of NATO Jaap de Hoop spoke today with a similar intent. 
"I am not happy about what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan. 
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is little," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo. 
Who Is Passive 
There are some quarrels among the countries involved over whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan. 
For example, Germany has been criticized for passivity. 
"Germans have rather a numerous representation in Afghanistan. 
Yet they are stationed in areas of minimum violence and the combat requirements on them are not as high as those on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," said Gates. 
The British tabloid The Sun labeled German soldiers as lazy this week. 
"The Afghan Layabouts Disclosed: Germans Play As Our Boys Fight," wrote The Sun in material accompanied by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis. 
The German Bild fought back and printed a photo of a British unit during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
