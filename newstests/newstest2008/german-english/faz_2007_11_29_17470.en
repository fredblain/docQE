Those Arent Warhols Boxes 
Connecting the terms Sweden and wooden box makes one think of Ikea, rather than Andy Warhol. 
Or does it? 
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden are casting dark shadows on Warhols catalogue of work. 
The bulk of the ninety-four Brillo Boxes Type Stockholm listed in it are forgeries. 
After Swedish newspaper Expressen had cast doubt on the authenticity of Andy Warhols 1968 Brillo Boxes several months ago, an internal investigation at the Moderna Museet, Stockholm, now comes to a sobering conclusion: The six Brillo Boxes donated to the Moderna Museet by former museum director Pontus Hultén in 1995 are forgeries  as, presumably, are the bulk of the nearly hundred further extant Brillo Boxes of the Type Stockholm in circulation on the international art market. 
The history is convoluted, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions. 
In 1964, Andy Warhol created his first Brillo Boxes in New York: painted wooden boxes based on the red, white and blue design of the Brillo soap cardboard boxes. 
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1969 presented  with Warhols consent  hundreds of Brillo Boxes made of cardboard: For economical reasons, those were not by Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard mill. 
They werent works of art, but their models  mere sample pieces. 
Simultaneously, Warhol apparently consented to the production of a small number of wooden Brillo Boxes in Sweden in 1968, which, however, were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet. 
Contemporary witnesses now speak of approximately fifteen boxes which made art and auction history as original Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes with the designation Type Stockholm back then, and rightly so. 
Some of them went for more than 100,000 dollars at auctions. 
The problem, now, is that legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, and subsequently consigned to him by Warhol. 
As a matter of fact, however, Hulténs 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg. 
At that point in time, Warhol had already been dead for three years. 
In addition to the six Brillo Boxes belonging to the Moderna Museet, Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at the museum, also examined three in private Swedish ownership, of which two had been manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: Their pressboards were first primed and sandpapered, then white oil paint was applied with a brush. 
The structure of the 1990 facsimiles reveals, however, that the paint was applied directly to the pressboard with a roller and without priming  and, further, that it wasnt oil paint, but acrylic. 
These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes, says Lars Nittwe, Director of the Moderna Museet. Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York arrives at a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as facsimiles/sample pieces. 
Of course, the Authentication Board had already announced an investigation into the grave allegations made in the case of the soapboxes back in July. 
However, it has been shrouded in adamant silence ever since.
