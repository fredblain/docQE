Bulgaria: The EU's real estate paradise 
The real estate market in Bulgaria has been developing at an unbelievable rate - all of Europe has its eyes on this heretofore rarely heard-of Balkan nation. 
Who is buying what and where on this market, which is still the cheapest in the EU despite rapidly rising prices? 
This analysis comes from RE/MAX's Bulgarian division. 
No question but that Bulgaria is the most sought-after East European real estate target, with its low-cost ski chalets and oceanfront homes. 
The most fashionable mountain sites are Bansko, Borovets, Pamporovo and Vitosha, while on the seaside the areas to which people are flocking are Albena, the Golden Sands, the Sunny Beach, and ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, although a rising number of investors are looking into real estate around Karvarna and Balcsik, too. 
According to RE/MAX Bulgaria analysts, sooner or later, the central portion of the country will begin attracting investors. So a growing number of people are already buying properties in Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Tryavna -, and more and more investors are looking around the Rousse area, which is expressly cheap at the moment. 
Sofia, the capital, also has many attractive opportunities. Commercial and office space offers the highest returns. 
Bulgaria is well on the way to becoming one of Europe's most exciting golf paradises. This means it need not only be a priority destination in winter and summer, for it has the resources to attract visitors during the other two seasons, too. 
Forward-thinking investors are already making major purchases, for instance, in and around Bansko. 
Analysts suggest that people who buy real estate in Bulgaria would also like to change their lifestyles. 
Most investors are from Britain, but many also come from France, Belgium, and Spain, with a growing number coming from Romania. 
Maltese and Cypriot investors have also gained a foothold, while Russians are traditional big-time buyers at the Black Sea and along top ski slopes. 
There are three types of international buyers, said regional manager of RE/MAX Bulgaria Georgi Yankov. 
The ones who plan to resettle in Bulgaria either purchase renovated properties for prices ranging from 50,000 euros to 100,000, or old fixer-uppers for 5,000-15,000 and then renovate them themselves. 
They want their purchases to be easy to access, and to be equipped for modern communication. It is important that they be in a big city, with shopping and, generally, a local doctor nearby. 
The next group of buyers is interested in summer homes (Bulgaria joined Germany's list of top-ten holiday destinations in December). 
The third includes investors for business purposes, who are counting on medium or long-term appreciation. 
Real estate prices in Sofia, the capital, are rising steadily, as is demand. 
While Bulgaria boasts the European Union's lowest real estate prices, they have still gone up by 21 percent in the past five years. 
Actually, the rise in real estate prices has exceeded the growth in salaries.
