Additional 400 million euros available for infrastructure 
Four hundred million euros in loans will become available for education, transportation, the environmental infrastructure and energy development in the wake of three accords signed by Finance Minister JÃ¡nos Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka, in Budapest on Friday. 
EIB approved a framework package of 300 million euros in 2006 to help the Hungarian budget finance transportation and environmental projects being implemented by the cohesion fund. A concrete agreement for 100 million from the package was signed earlier, so one new contract covers use of the remaining 200 million euros. 
The second agreement, for 150 million euros, will help the budget finance education-related projects. 
EIB has already approved a 300 million euro package for Hungary to use for upgrades to these areas. The extra 150 million euros can be used later, when the credit agreement is extended. 
The third agreement was for 50 million euros to be used for innovation. The central budget plans to incorporate it primarily into a R&D project at Debrecen University. 
The talks included a new metro line under construction in Budapest. 
They agreed that when Hungary finalizes metro financing details with the EU, they would revisit the original contracts to see whether they needed to be amended, and if so, how. 
Veres said he believed that latter discussion would take place in the first quarter of 2008. 
EIB has provided Hungary with the equivalent of 8.4 billion euros since 1990, which were used to finance 113 projects. 
EIB is linking interest rates on the loans to the EURIBOR. It is allowing an 8 year grace period, and is charging no commission to maintain fund availability.
