Today, she came before Khartoum court for having named a teddy bear 
The English teacher tried in Sudan for offending Islam has been sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment and to expulsion by Khartoum court on Thursday night, explained her lawyer. 
The English teacher has been accused of allowing her pupils aged between 6 and 7 to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear, when every representation of the Islam's prophet is banned. 
She was liable to lashes punishment. 
This 54-year-old English teacher, who was working at the Unity High School of Khartoum in Sudan, has been arrested last Sunday at her home, with the accuse both of threatenig Islam and sedition, according to the article no. 125 of the Sudanese criminal code, following many complaints of the children's parents to the Sudan's Ministry Of Education. 
In fact, the case goes back to the month of September, when the school teacher asked her pupils, aged between 6 and 7, to choose a name for the class teddy bear. 
«Eight names came out from the children's mouth, among those Hassan, Abdullah and Muhammad», explains the school headmaster Robert Boulos. 
At the end, after the class'vote, 20 children out of 23 have choosen Muhammad as their favourite name. 
Surely, Muhammad is the name of the Muslim prophet, but first of all it's a very common name in Sudan. 
Then, the children created a book for the class with the bear's picture followed by the legend «My name is Muhammad». 
The bear itself didn't wear any label with that name, but the problem lies in the prophet's represantation, considered as an offense to Islam. 
A Muslim collegue of Gillian Gibbons, who's a teacher in the same school in Sudan, has highlighted that he knew her well and that she would have never done anything offensive for any faith, «I'm just sorry she has asked her pupils to vote for a name», according to him, it's simply an «innocent mistake». 
It's an opinion shared with many of the teacher's pupils, who describe her as «very attentive towards her pupils» and «a person who never talks about religion within the class». 
Moreover, it should be reminded that Muhammad is the second most common name in Great Britain, which is written in English in 14 different ways. 
This name, which is often choosen by Muslim families, is one way of honouring the prophete (it is often given to the family's firstborn). 
But which rules regulate the use of that name? 
For istance, is it possible to give it to a toy? 
Certainly, it's a matter of interpretation.
