Czech Republic has chance to get 365 billion. 
The ministers of the Czech Government, together with the representatives of the European Union, signed nine operational programs yesterday, from which the Czech Republic can acquire 14 billion Euro (approximately 365 billion Czech crowns) in the following years. 
This is roughly half the total sum the Czech Republic can acquire from Brussels during the years 2007 to 2013. 
Approximately 125 billion Czech crowns will move from seven operational programs into the regions. 
Czech companies will be able to gain about 100 billion Czech crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation program. 
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will be directed into transportation. 
The Transportation program is the biggest operational program, it represents almost 22 percent of the resources which the Czech Republic can obtain from the funds. 
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transportation Infrastructure, which will be managing a sum of 90.8 billion Czech crowns next year. 
The Enterprise and Innovation program ought to serve the entrepreneurs and companies to gain the resources for innovational business. 
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, for the industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective methods of organization. 
As for the actual extraction of money from the EU funds, the Czech Republic is thus far among the least successful within the newly accepted countries.
