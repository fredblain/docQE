A 20-year sentence for the ex-President of Nicaragua has been upheld by the court. 
The Nicaraguan court of appeal upheld the 20-year sentence for the ex-President of the country, Arnoldo Alemán, in which he was convicted in 2003 for financial fraud of up to $100 million (almost 1.8 billion Czech crowns)on Thursday. 
However, he was later liberated and was under house arrest at his hacienda, not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis. 
Whether the former head of this Central American state from 1997-2002 will go back behind bars, is not clear at the moment according to the Associated Press. 
According to the chairperson of the court of appeal, Ileana Péréz, it will now be dependent on the custodial officials, whether they will let Aléman serve his sentence at home, or if he will go to prison. 
The court proved four years ago that Aléman had regularly shifted government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama. 
These companies were imaginary and the accounts were actually held by his relatives and closest adherents. 
Some of the money ended up in a fund which Aléman established to finance his election campaigns in 2001.
