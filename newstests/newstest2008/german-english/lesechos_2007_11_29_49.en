The Bank of England replies to concerns by lending 10 billion pounds for five weeks 
The Bank of England announced on Thursday its aim to cast aside inflation concerns and said it will lend 10 billion pounds at its benchmark interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an unusual loan period. 
"In order to cast aside concerns according to which the financial market will be particularly thin at the end of the year and to give banks greater cetainty in the organisation of their liquidity, the Bank is going to offer a significant proportion of its contribution of reserves during the scheduled maintenance period starting on the 6th December, with an operation of five weeks open market", explains the Bank in a press release. 
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be lent at base rate from the 6 of December at 12H15 GMT until January. 
It's the first time that the BoE lends liquidities for five weeks in an open market operation. 
The funding is usually offered over a one-week period. 
The BoE adds in its press release that it "will be ready to adopt further measures to maintain the rate of day by day interbanking loans in line with its basic rates. 
The day by day interbanking rate stood at 5,829% on Wednesday. 
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, the highest since the 18th September. 
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the funds of the Bank of England have always had a significant penalty rate which deterred the intervention of the banks. 
According to certain rumours, confirmed by the change in the pound's quotation against the euro, many people preferred the offers of the European Central Bank, at profitable rates and with assured discretion.
