So They've Approved Our Budget 
That's it. 
The state budget has been accepted. 
What makes this budget special? 
It is the first budget built by this government and accepted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition. 
The one for this year was passed last year still with the support of the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), because it was prepared by minister Sobotka and CSSD could not afford for it to not be accepted. 
In contrast to the animated debate before the vote of no-confidence in the government, nothing extreme has occurred this time. 
The Chamber of Deputies has passed this traditionally overlooked but most influential law easily. 
It is a sort of paradox. 
Each governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, like it or not. 
The budget is a substantial part of politics, but it is covered by the struggle for power between the government and the opposition. 
It is more widely appreciated by the media, that is why the media pay much more attention to it. 
The politicians' quarrels are much more interesting for the public than straight numbers. 
The state budgets of the past social democratic governments suffered from three maladies which 2008's budget is not able to resolve all at once: 
First, there is the high portion of the expenditures mandatory by law, the so-called mandatory expenditures, including not only pensions, but also social benefits passed last year before the elections by the silent "alliance" of CSSD and the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM). 
Second, there is the deficit economy as a result of the first malady. 
The third limit is the deficits in public financing, i.e. the budget deficit of cities and villages. 
However, the state budget deficit is not the biggest risk. 
It is public and relatively under control. 
The time bomb here is the deficit of the budgets of cities and villages. 
Many mayors, in order to gain resources for their investments other than the money from taxes, fees, and bank loans, often mindlessly issued securities, with which they unreasonably incurred debt for the councils. 
In the past years, they managed to pay the debts off by the mass sale of stocks of the power and distribution networks they acquired from the state during privatization. 
They no longer have this resource. 
If we stick just to the official and certifiable facts, we discover that: 
Our economy has already been passing through the phase of growth for a few years, as is the rest of the world, about which CSSD keeps boasting. 
This has been a unique opportunity for its governments to put public financing in order. 
But instead they continued incurring debt for the state more and more. 
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed the money much more reasonably than our republic. 
It is a huge shame, which falls mainly upon the previous governments. 
We are among the countries which are, measured globally, endangered by poverty to the least extent. 
Therefore there is no need for any massive social programs, which have unfortunately been inflated to a huge extent in the past years. 
Though they managed to cancel a part of the absurd populistic expenditures passed this year before the elections, if the shift of the age limit for retirement and the revision of pensions does not take place soon, any politics in this country will virtually end, regardless of who is ruling then, it will be mere paperwork. 
With a bit of exaggeration, we can say that the governing politicians will become white-collar workers mechanically distributing most of the taxed money between pensions and social benefits. 
Therefore this year's budget cannot be revolutionary in any way, it can only set back the mandatory expenditures pushing away the normal expenditures. 
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be totally useless if the past governments had not lost as much as they could during the last ten years. 
If we do not want to let the governing politicians become mere white-collar workers, we have to be patient and allow the not very strong coalition government, which is aware of the fact that the state can give over only as much as it can obtain on taxes and charges, peace for the preparation of other reform laws. 
Only they will allow for a gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.
