UMP and NC refuse to examin PS's proposals on the purchaising power 
UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss some sections of the socialist bill on the purchaising power, that means they refused the text. 
Conceived in a socialist setting (session on the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, including the 50% increase in the premium for employment, the TIPP re-introduction, a cheque-transport or the rental charges control. 
Since UMP and NC voted against those sections of the bill (180 against 115 votes), the meeting closed at the end of an often heated argument between majority and opposition, a few hours after the television speech of Nicolas Sarkozy on the purchaising power. 
The PS leader, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group will represent the integrality of his proposals by moving an amendment to the financial bill which will be examined by the Commission the next week.
