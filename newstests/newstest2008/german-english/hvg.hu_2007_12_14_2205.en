the moment you decide to meet expectations, you cease to be interesting 
I'm creeping along in the car in the usual morning traffic jam. 
The radio starts playing an unusual tune: it's a violin sound with special electronic effects. 
I give it a bit more volume. 
The music changes beat and a base tone joins the other instruments. Then, like a true jewel, a female choir steps in. 
I'm listening to Zagar's Wings of Love on mr2. 
The domestic music world hasn't spoiled us with high quality electronic pop in a long time. 
But now, all of a sudden you can look at the traffic jam in a new light while listening to the new Zagar CD. 
The appearance of Yonderboi and the few new and exciting productions that have popped up from the domestic digital underground are slowly changing the overall picture. Although guitar-pinging garage rock is back in style, domestic electropop is ready to prove that there IS something new under the sun. 
Balázs Zságer got his start in Pécs and even played in the Yonderboi ensemble for a time. Then, maybe because this town just wasn't big enough for the two of them - he moved on to do his own thing. 
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music, and pop began pushing upward into the public ear when he was suddenly asked to compose soundtracks for films (such as 
Ferenc Török's Ferenc Szezon [Season]). 
A wider audience got to know his combos, which initially played in smaller clubs, when "wan2" magazine listed his first CD among Hungary's top 50 in 2002 and said Zagar was the only member of Yonderboi who was marketable in the west and who looked like a domestic trend-setter. 
No question about it, Zagar and his group became "trendy." But, no one bothered to ask them if they liked the label. 
The group responded with a new and even better CD. 
Their latest, called Cannot Walk Fly Instead, which is just out, can open new vistas although in itself the title seeks to connect them to their early years in Pécs. 
The title is a line used by Balázs Zságer's old Pécs group. 
We would be on course with the easygoing reference to flight but for the effects of the louder guitar and the rock and roll beat that joins the soaring tones, homage to the spirit of the times. 
György Ligeti, who sings in Britain with The Puzzle, made his intro with these tunes, when the disc was premiered at the Millenáris. 
The CD produced a real radio hit. mr2 Petőfi, which of late has been playing pop music from morning till night, started a stealth offensive on our ears with Wings of Love and the soaring sounds produced by the six Hungarian female singers ("Underground Divas"). 
So, everything's okay. Or is it?. 
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer. 
hvg.hu: The question this new hit song raises is just how culty your music has remained? 
Zságer: I don't see much meaning in the term cult music. 
I think there are two light music castes; not mainstream and underground and not alternative and pop, but commerce and honest. 
So-called alternative or underground music can be dull and uninspiring and produced for the sole purpose of boosting sales, which puts it in the commerce category. 
While a good pop song can be sparked by honest motives. 
The attitudes of the recipients operate in that spirit, irrespectively of language and national boundaries. 
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the receptivity of domestic and international audiences as far as your music goes? 
B.Zs.: Light music has more tradition abroad, especially west of here. 
Over there, older people also come to concerts, not just teens and twenty-somethings. 
They pay far more attention to changes in the genre because they consider it a part of contemporary culture. 
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work? 
Do the people who listen to your music, and the number who listen make a difference? 
B.Zs.: Of course it feels good to see more and more people at our concerts. 
But we have never designed our music for the market. 
Our music comes from inspiration, not some target or goal. 
The role of the audience comes out at the concerts when the effects are contagious, but even that comes from the intangible changes triggered by the moment. 
I have actually noticed that the moment you decide that you want to meet audience expectations, you cease to be interesting. 
hvg.hu: To what extent do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example? 
He's a soloist and has built a career west of where we are. 
B.Zs.: We're not really following his path even though sometimes people claim to hear him in our music. 
We are much stronger team players. We trust one another's musical presence and allow that to thrive. 
In the beginning there was no way to avoid having our music compared to Yonderboi since several of us split from that group, though we chose a different road. 
hvg.hu: Wings of Love hit first place on mr2 Petőfi's hit parade. 
Many folks first heard the name Zagar with this number. 
Was the more popular style a deliberate outreach to a broader audience? 
B.Zs.: We never planned to have a hit to boost CD sales. 
That song is about much more. 
We intended it to wrap up the album, to try to lighten up the orgy of tone and the tougher themes earlier in the CD. 
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six female singers? 
Why did you pick the voices you did - what was your guiding principle? 
B.Zs.: The idea was to have a sound like a gospel choir. 
The it occurred to us to put the choir together using soloists from the domestic music scene who sing really well. 
That gave us the six-voice choir - of Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], and Juci Németh -, whom we simply named Underground Divas. 
hvg.hu: Is the result exactly as you envisioned it, or did the girls play a role in shaping the sound? 
B.Zs.: We had had an instrumental version of it for quite some time. But then, when we were putting the CD together, we got the feeling that we needed to add something. 
The chordal sequence was crying out for a vocal section. 
I sang the melody onto the instrumental that day, and that was how the girls learned it afterwards. 
The whole thing came to me all at once and it was shockingly spontaneous. 
I remember being totally excited by it at the time, but the Divas really were necessary to make it work. 
It never would have been this powerful in my voice. 
hvg.hu: The girls appeared to be secondary, on both the disc and at the concert. 
There is no solo (excepting Judy Jay's tiny one), they have no separate role, they sing completely in unison and they don't outsing the music, so it's not as though they were singing to subordinate musical accompaniment. 
On stage, they stood at the back. 
Was all that deliberate? 
B.Zs.: The reason why they stood at the back of the stage was because of technical problems. 
But not distributing solos was deliberate. 
The whole number was about forgetting our egos for a time, not caring who came from where and where they are headed, and simply letting those wings, the wings of love, lift us up. 
I wanted others to also get the feeling of the euphoria we went through when the song was born. 
hvg.hu: Which one gave you the most work? 
B.Zs.: None really, as far as the process of musical creation was concerned - but some of them gave us a hard time with the arrangement. 
For instance Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play on a concert piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't want to work for the longest time - but everything eventually ended up fitting, kind of like a jigsaw puzzle. 
hvg.hu: What's your own favourite number on this CD? 
B.Zs.: That keeps changing with every concert, especially now that I've already let go of the CD. 
At the moment it's Prophet is A Fool, Escape from the Earth, and Never the Same.
