Botched Surgery Suspected in a Death in New Jersey 
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the big plate-glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance pulled up to the white Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue. 
Soon, there was a police patrol car. 
And then there was another. 
"Then I saw the medical examiner's van pull up," Mr. Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant, said on Wednesday. 
"That's when I knew somebody was gone." 
The authorities would learn that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an executive assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department. 
Now investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, whom the police did not identify, working in the house at 212 West Scott Avenue. 
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicology tests, the results of which might not be available for weeks, will help solve a mysterious death that has sent a spasm of grief through the top ranks of the Newark police. 
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department. 
"She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious," Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday. 
"She was my pit bull. 
She would protect me." 
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she leaves two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter. 
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for the Union County prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died as the result of an unlicensed surgical procedure. 
"That's one of the possibilities," Ms. Walsh said. 
"It's an ongoing investigation." 
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 p.m. on Nov. 
21 and found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa. 
She was pronounced dead at the scene. 
More than a week has gone by, and the authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro. 
Ms. Walsh would not say whether Ms. Castro had been interviewed by the authorities. 
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical office. 
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Ms. Castro's home, where a withered rosebush stood in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barked in the back. 
A blue drum labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in a carport, next to a door that led to the basement. 
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks off to one side. 
Mr. McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate his new city's insular and rough-hewn political culture. 
"She would say, 'You've got to watch out for this one or that one,'" he said. 
"She was always here when I got here, and she was always here when I left. 
It was embarrassing."
