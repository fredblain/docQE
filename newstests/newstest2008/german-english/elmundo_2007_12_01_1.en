20,000 people in Vancouver attending the first concert of the Spice Girls' tour. 
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver (Canada), in front of 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000. 
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before the concert at the stadium GM Place in Vancouver that the group meeting is "brilliant". 
Around 20,000 people bought tickets to witness the concert that included a video which tells the group story that made furor at the end of 1990. 
The reunion and world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that includes their major successes as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo", which are published by EMI in Spain. 
The five members of Spice Girls came out on stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', the British footballer David Beckham. 
The athlete was among the public that filled GM Place, despite the fact that due to nervousness Victoria had forbidden it days earlier. 
Prior to the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "has not seen our apparel, for nothing, so I am nervous about what he will think about the spectacle." 
"Sporty Spice" whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" led the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show. 
"I was scared". 
"I was nervous to see that the world's sense has changed, the feeling about the Spice Girls has changed. 
And I thought why not, so I am happy for having taken the decision" said Chisholm about the reunion of the group that she disbanded nine years ago. 
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been settled and we still love each other a lot." 
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls acted together for the last time in 1998. 
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived at Vancouver in a special Virgin Airlines plane. 
Upon their arrival at the airport, waiting for them there was an army of nannies. 
Among the five joined seven children. 
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will appear in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th). 
In Madrid they will appear on December 23th.
