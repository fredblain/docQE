Virgin plans to make with Northern Rock 42,000 euros million in three years 
Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50% to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it went in crisis in the middle of September and had to resort to emergency credit from the Bank of England. 
At the time it needed deposits of over 25,000 million pounds, a figure that has been progressively falling in the last two months due to the distrust of its clients and in spite of the guarantee of the one hundred percent of that money offered by the Government and who will maintain it until the end of the crisis. 
Virgin, that would rename the organization to its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to get around a quarter of revenues in British banks that are deposited in next the three years to obtain those 18,000 million remaining pounds until reaching the objective of 30,000 million. 
The group of the tycoon Richard Branson, known for his showy advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends spending 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on publicity and marketing research to achieve his purposes. 
Northern Rock named this week the partnership of Virgin, which includes three other companies, as its favourite to rescue it from bankruptcy.
