German Wages Feared to Drop in 2007 
Despite a strong economy, wage earners in Germany have to fear a drop in actual wages in 2007, projections say. 
Experts cited a number of reasons for their pessimistic projections. 
According to calculations by the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees could face drops in actual wages in 2007, relative to the previous year. 
The causes are a modest wage growth, the value-added tax increase and price advances for food and energy, Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the daily newspaper Bild. 
Additionally, new burdens could emerge for wage-earners in the unemployment insurance contribution. 
Lowering the unemployment insurance contribution, as planned, to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was appropriate and reasonable in the present situation, Secretary of the Treasury Peer Steinbrück told the daily newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung. 
However, the Social Democrat reportedly also said that the Federal Employment Office should not have to ask for federal loans or grants again. 
On Tuesday, it was revealed that exploding prices for food and petroleum products were resulting in the highest inflation rate in 13 years. 
Overall, there was a year-on-year price increase of 3.0 percent.
