The statu quo choice 
There won't be any suspense at Sunday exit poll: Russians are opting overwhelmingly for the party of the President Putin, united Russia. 
Confirming in this way their aim to stability, event to the authoritarianism, after an incisive campaign. 
Three days before the legislative elections, the Russian president Vladimir Putin appeals to his voters with TV message on the public networks, which has already been registered but whose content rest kept in secret. 
He acts as leading candidate of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party for which is expected an overwhelming triumph. 
Yesterday, welcoming the foreign ambassadors, the President did not betray anything, bringing just a further charge against the West, accused of interference - his favourite subject during the campaign. 
« We know the price of a true democracy and we are expecting fair, absolutely clear and open elections, without any obstacles.», he added. 
According to the opposition, this result seems too far. 
It denounces an under pressure campaign. 
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that «there has never been so dirty elections, even in Eltsin times». 
After the repression of the last week-end demonstrations, it's still forbidden to visit the ex world champion of flop, Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days'imprisonment for illegal demonstration, said his lawyer. 
« Russians saved the homo sovieticus mentality. » 
Behind those legislative elections without any suspense, there are two wider questions: 
- Who will be Putin's successor? 
The official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the elections, on the 2nd March 2008; the candidates have time until the 23rd December to come forward. 
Elected for the first time in 2000 and for a second time in 2004, Vladimir Putin can not afford a third mandate. 
At the present, there isn't any emerging successor. 
- Which role is Putin going to play after March? 
Prime Minister? 
Leader of the parlamentary majority and of the most powerful party United Russia, which is going to choose both the government and the president? 
Whatever the case may be, at the legislative elections, as well as at the presidential ones, the outgoing party will triumph. 
It is a tradition. 
« Russians saved the homo sovieticus mentality, they do not feel the owners of their destiny», considers the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada indipendent centre. 
Nikolaï Kopossov, a historian of the St. Petersburg State University, goes farther: the civil society in this Christianized country was five centuries late than in Europe; the well-known community attitude postponed the birth of individualism. 
After the liberal reformes of the 1990s, « Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, considering that the new paternalism wasn't followed by a period of terror but by economic affluence », states Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation. 
Russians are "voluntarily renouncing the personal responsibility » that they had briefly shown after the collapse of the URSS. 
«What's to be considered then?» 
The phenomenon affects every social class, business included. 
And the administrative élite aims to keep the statu quo: 65 governors (out of 85 laeders of Russian regions) are heading the local lists of United Russia. 
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonym of chaos, as it happened in the 1990s. 
The public opinion prefers the stability. 
It is the reason for which Russians won't vote for extremists. 
Here are Tamara Tcherednitchenko conclusions, 54-year-old professor: «What's to be considered then? 
Those who are in power are not so bad, why changing them? »
