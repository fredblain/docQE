Tiny Saarland, Good Education 
The smallest German federal state is leading the field in vocational training, and distinguishes itself through the international character of its university-level institutions in particular. 
In one field of education, however, Saarland citizens are affected by the same shortcomings as the rest of the country. 
"Yesterday I met someone not from Saarland, and I had to point out for the 50th time that we are not Frenchmen" - with this self-deprecating advertising slogan, the smallest German federal state celebrates its 50th birthday. 
At the same time, France and Luxemburg play major roles in Saarland's educational system, which, according to a so-called education monitor of the German Business Institute (IW), Cologne, ranks fifth. 
The university-level institutions' cooperation with the neighboring countries, for instance, is part of a tradition. 
Saarbrücken's university was founded by the French in 1948. 
Even now, students there have the opportunity to obtain bi-national or even tri-national degrees. 
As a consequence, the share of foreign students is large, making up 15.6 percent. 
Nonetheless, the number of students native to Saarland is also above average at the state's university-level institutions, although many of those students do not have a diploma from a college-preparatory high school. 
"In Saarland, many people make use of the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW. 
More than every fifth adolescent acquires their higher-education entrance qualification at a vocational school, which places Saarland above the federal average by more than seven percentage points. 
Opportunities to combine vocational and academic education are developed comparatively strongly. 
Relative to population, the supply of combined vocational and academic studies ranks second in Germany. 
Despite a practice-oriented education and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years. 
Consequently, Saarlands Department of Education is committing university-level institutions to a marketing campaign for engineering sciences. 
After the first PISA survey, we initiated a number of reforms at general-education schools, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education says. 
For instance, the government introduced statewide comparative tests. 
In order for children to commence studying earlier, the final year at day-care centers is free of charge  a model which other German federal states have begun to adopt. 
Whether the students performence has improved substantially, future comparative surveys will show. 
The 2003 PISA survey showed the share of at-risk students shrinking from 29 to 20 percent. 
Overall, Saarland did not improve as much as other German federal states, however. 
Bavarins are better at mathematics. 
And, much to the chagrin of Saarlanders, PISA does not evaluate foreign language skills  an area in which they might score. 
After all, studying the neighbors language is mandatory at college-preparatory high schools  even though Saarlanders are not Frenchmen.
