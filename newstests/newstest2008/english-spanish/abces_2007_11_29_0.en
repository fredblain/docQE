Bono accepts to head the candidacy of the PSOE for Toledo and to preside over the Congress if won. 
The ex- Defense minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the government president and General Secretary of the Socialists, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in case the Socialists gain the general elections. 
This was announced in a press conference by the secretary of Organization of the PSOE, Jose Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting that was held this afternoon in the federal seat of the party with Zapatero. 
The chief executive has justified the offer to the ex- minister because "it's important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best". 
In addition, it was also pointed out that "it seems" that the Manchego group socialist candidate will preside the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections. 
Bono would replace the Congress president Manuel Marín, that on 15th November made public his decision of not standing for the next general elections and to abandon his career in politics to dedicate himself to fight against the climatic change in the university level. 
The ex- minister has recognized that the Government president has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left two years ago. 
In addition, he has indicated that, like the citizens know who will be the economic vice-president if the PSOE gains the elections, they have wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in a "act of transparency". 
If he gains office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not insult or shout". And make it "more and more visible to the citizens". 
"Sometimes unfortunately it appears that the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to be speak with confidence and calmness is the Congress, the Government president on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times". 
Also, he has praised the current president, Manuel Marín and "the good work he's doing" and has not wanted to be viewed as already occupying his post, not to fall in what, his adversaries could view as "arrogance".
