National Debt to Vault to a Trillion in 2009 
There is national debt of more than 84 000 crowns for each Czech. 
The total debt rose by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns. 
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year. 
But at the beginning of December the ministry cut the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to the improved development of use of the state budget. 
The Czech Republic's national debt rose by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns. 
It has risen by 40.2 billion crowns in the nine months of this year. 
Though it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns since June. 
This is the way in which the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the national debt from the beginning of October today. 
A debt of more than 84,000 crowns for each Czech. 
During all of last year, the state incurred debts of more than 111 billion crowns. 
"For now it appears that thanks to the lower deficit for the next year, we should not break the trillion crown limit until 2009. 
Next year the debt should range from 900 billion to a trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHned.cz. 
Next Finance analyst Vladim√≠r Pikora sees it in a similar way: "We can get over the trillion limit in the course of the year 2009. 
The exact date will depend on the next budget, which we do not know yet. 
If the situation in the political arena were to change, the politicians would be willing to spare more, it could be postponed to 2010. 
But we do not predict such a change," he said. 
Debts Are Growing 
The national debt consists of the debts of the central government and emerges above all due to the accumulation of state budget deficits. 
The national debt is financed by treasury notes, government bonds, direct loans or for example by loans from the European Investment Bank. 
The state's internal debt has risen 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns this year. 
The foreign debt of the state has risen 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns this year. 
The so-called marketable national debt reached 803.3 billion crowns by the end of September and has fallen 13.7 billion crowns since June. 
The average due date of the national debt rose to 6.5 years. 
"The absolute interim debt for the first to third quarter rose 13 percent, which is quite a lot compared to the state of the economy. 
What is interesting is that the growth is generated especially through bonds, where the growth is 20 percent. 
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that we will have something to trade when the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data. 
Better than Expected 
It follows from the strategy of national debt financing and control for 2007 that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year. 
But at the beginning of December, the ministry decreased the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to improved development of the use of the state budget. 
The sum consists mainly of the state budget deficit, which will probably reach 76 billion crowns instead of the assumed 91.3 billion crowns this year. 
It also includes the planned maximal resources of 13.3 billion crowns for the Czech Consolidation Agency, a ten billion reserve for pension pay-outs, financing of government bonds for 43 billion crowns and the installment payment of the loans from the European Investment bank totaling 1.8 billion crowns.
