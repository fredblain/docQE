Things that happen 
1. 
If it seems to you, we are going to leave the Book of the Month, and see if in the meanwhile we have another Awardology and other competitions. 
I'm already sketching something. 
Life is change, people. 
Of course, you're invited to put forward inventions.

Our Finnish correspondent provided this commentary from yesterday's Helsingin Sanomat, the most important Finnish newspaper (by the way in head of the PISA report about educative level in the world), which refers to what was published on November 18th, the same day in which appeared there a specific criticism to the book of Blackburn: 
"The content of Philosophy signature has come to the public attention as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela's school. 
To blame for the deaths, a high school student mentioned in his messages works of Plato and Nietzsche. 
The Education Advisor and responsible for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that professors adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and affirmed that to study Nietzsche is not essential in the obligatory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes".

A colleague has passed information over the introduction in the Penal Code of the crimes over downloading from the Internet: 
A. The downloading of one song would be a criminal offence carrying a penalty of six months to a year. 
However, if you steal from the music store for a value inferior to 400 euros, it is considered simply a misdemeanour(article 623,1). 
B. If you steal from the store up to 1000 euros, the theft already is crime, but the penalty continues being inferior to the one imposed for downloading (article 234 of the Penal Code). 
C. If you steal a car and you give it back 40 hours later, the penalty continues being inferior to the one for downloading (article 244,1). 
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the interchange of degraded music. 
To participate in a big fight carries a penalty of three months to a year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the interchange would have a penalty of six months to two years 
(article 270 of the Penal Code). 
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to article 184,2 of the Penal Code. 
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authors' authorization carries a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186). 
Well, if my colleague is right, somebody is stretching the law a bit too far.

My attending physician gave me an article on a rare investigation titled: "Money produces brain activity, mainly if the others receive less'. 
That is, that the feelings that are generated by the monthly wages of the workers depends on how much colleagues earn. 
A study has been made by tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results have been published in the last issue of Science. 
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life & Brain Institute, in Germany: "the hardest activation took place when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed". 
The investigators observed that when both guessed right and received the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one received double, the activation was greater. 
I do not know if this conclusion required as much science.
