Deceiving Broker Ventured Billions due to Inferiority Complex 
A perfidious embezzler. 
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the local Komerční banka (Commerce Bank), labels its ex-employee Jerome Kerviel. 
On his account it has lost almost five billion Euro. 
More likely, it seems that Kerviel was just a big gambler who wanted to match his colleagues, and, moreover, definitely not an unqualified one. 
Unlike all the big banking houses, he recognized the crisis at the American mortgage market in time. 
"He is psychologically weak," were the words of his superiors, who directed the police to him. 
But, as follows from Kerviel's testimony, which has been published by French media, e.g. the Le Monde journal, he was a man who gained 1.6 billion Euro from his transactions by the end of last year. 
A Crisis Not Only in the U.S. 
"All I ever wanted was to gain some money for my bank," he claims in his testimony. 
In the summer he managed to gain a half billion Euro from this American crisis. 
He had found the opportunity at the beginning of the year. 
The news appeared in February that the so-called sub-prime mortgage loans, provided to low-income clients or to those who had problems with paying them off in the past, are going to have problems. 
Nevertheless, the crisis should not have influenced the entire economy. 
Kerviel did not believe this and it was the right bet. 
By the end of the year, his profit had climbed to 1.6 billion Euro. 
"Even when I gained the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," admits Kerviel and adds that he definitely didn't keep any of it for himself. 
Throughout the entire hearing he has admitted that he forged the records so that he would not be revealed. 
He managed to deceive his superiors, even though the Eurex Exchange became interested in his affairs. 
Nothing ventured, nothing gained. 
Was he afraid that he would be discovered? 
Rather not. 
"I thought that the simple fact of my gaining 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them. 
Where did he get the will to risk that much? 
He had to work up to his position gradually. 
He entered Société Générale in the 2000, immediately after he had finished his university studies in Lyon. 
His annual income was around $51,000. 
Two years later, he was already an assistant to the broker, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual income of $90,000. 
Still he knew he would never earn as much as the others. 
"As early as during my first interview in 2005, I knew they despised me. 
Because of my education, and also for my professional and personal development," Kerviel described the situation to the investigators. 
But soon after Kerviel entered his career, the first big success followed. 
Thanks to the Allianz shares he gained; during the London bombings he bet a half billion Euro that they would fall. 
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more. 
As Long as You Gain, We Let You 
"It's like a snowball," he told the police. 
But his superiors are said to have known, or rather suspected the whole thing. 
"As long as I was earning money for them, they pretended not to see." 
But then, at the beginning of the year, a blow came. 
In a single day, he lost 1 billion Euro. 
He wanted to expunge the whole thing after the weekend in the middle of January. 
When he came to the office on Monday, he was no longer employed by the bank. 
And a few days later, the bank announced it had lost 5 billion Euro because of him. 
So how did they uncover him? 
He became suspicious through his vacations. 
"I took only four days out of the last year. 
A broker who does not take vacations is a broker who does not want anybody to look into his records," Kerviel concluded.
