The Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Melting Prejudices 
To tell the truth, I have never rooted for Peugeot 206 too much. 
Its handling characteristics have not been anything special, the quality of gear control, driving control and construction could occasionally have been labeled as mediocre. 
But now there is its successor, the Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is far better. 
And the station wagon called SW goes even a step further and I cannot help but to give it another thought. 
When I was testing the classical Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained for example about the headroom in the back seat. 
Here the complaints are over, because the station wagon's body means that not even two-meter tall giants will suffer in this respect. 
At a Glance 
I will pass through the interior quickly, so as not to repeat myself too much. 
We have quite an excellent design here, where the only critique I have is the meager central tunnel. 
I would appreciate some more designer inventiveness here, as the car itself looks so elegant. 
The seats are comfortable and the times when we could have complained about short seats or seat backs are truly behind us. 
Also, the lateral seat support has improved markedly in comparison with the 206 model. 
Considering the space, we can feel the build-up in the car body dimensions as well. 
In the station, then, the already mentioned lack of headroom disappears. 
Suitcases into the Trunk 
So the main thing about this car is its trunk. 
I must evaluate it as very well accessible (thanks also to the hinged quarter window) and fairly spacious. 
The blind spots are equipped with retaining elastics, which are an ideal compromise. 
It doesn't block space, it can be dilated and yet it holds even heavier objects. 
But let us pause to observe the volume. 
According to the tables it is in 428 l the basic arrangement, which, compared to its competitors, is rather average. 
But not in comparison with the best selling car of this class in Bohemia - the Skoda Fabia Station Wagon. 
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of Mlad√° Boleslav products, we will see that the Peugeot lags highly noticeable 52 liters behind. 
For vacations in foreign countries or with a baby-carriage load, this number is almost critical. 
Though if I were to accent the positive points, I would have to mention the absolutely flat surface when turning down the seat backs in the second row or the very low threshold. 
120 Horses in Four Rows 
The tested wagon was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with 1.6 l capacity and 88kW power. 
And to tell the truth, this is how a 1600 which powers a family hatchback should look. 
It is quiet, it has low expenditure, and above all it really moves. 
If I compare it to the Skoda equivalent, which sometimes makes you feel like it has a rag stuck in the exhaust, I cannot help but be delighted. 
The Hint is in the Price 
The car's price is not cheap. 
Nevertheless, we shall bear in mind that we have tested a fairly equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine. 
The basic price of the car with a 1.6 petrol engine of 329,900 Czech crowns is not that bad. 
Our assembly costs a minimum of 410,900, which is pretty much already. 
The tested equipment Premium will include equipment worth some 80, 000 Czech crowns more. 
But besides, we had the head airbags, the automatic air-condition, the automatic screen-wiper activation, the electric rear-window control... 
The car simply costs 531,900 Czech crowns all in all. 
This is quite a bit, but if you consider the the additional equipment of Fabia, you will get a very similar number. 
So there's nothing else to do but to choose based on the brand-name.
