In the Realm of Angela in the Sky 
Divorced from reality, the Chancellors performance documents that the coalition is at the end of its rope conceptually  and that expectations in herself have to be scaled down to nil. 
What country, exactly, does the Federal Chancellor live in? 
After her desolate performance at the Bundestags general debate, which was cloddy and bereft of substance, the verdict is: not this one  not in the country she ought to be governing. 
The charge that she concentrated too much on foreign affairs, she dismissed with a terribly presumptuous statement. 
It was provincial, she said, thereby demonstrating her refusal to grasp the critics meaning. 
At the Bundestag, she documented, in plain sight of everyone, how right on target their criticisms are. 
Neither a tangible concern for, nor any sense of the countrys issues could be detected. 
Instead, she presented herself as Angela in the Sky: a detached politician who takes refuge in foreign affairs, but remains noncommittal even there. 
Take, for instance, climate protection: She excessively blows her own horn on the resolutions of Heiligendamm, but does not share how climate protection objectives are to be achieved in this country. 
And anyway, the self-praise  two years ago, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union would have denied herself this much immodesty. 
Now she is clinging to the slogan that the economic boom has arrived at peoples doorsteps. 
In doing so, she damages her reputation as a pragmatist who solves problems, instead of sugarcoating the truth. 
But in the realm of Angela in the Sky, domestic issues are of marginal importance. 
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage earners? 
A few asides are all she has time for on that. 
It is telling how often she misspeaks when it comes to childrens allowance. 
At this point in her address, Merkel needs three attempts to produce a reasonably serviceable sentence. 
As soon as things become concrete, she stumbles as if on unfamiliar ground.
