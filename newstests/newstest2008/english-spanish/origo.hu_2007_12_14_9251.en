UK uses YouTube as military recruiting tool 
British military units have been sharing their Iraqi and Afghanistani actions through video clips on You Tube in an effort to popularize their missions. 
The Royal Air Force (RAF) was the first to develop a taste for YouTube: its special forces in Afghanistan have been uploading video clips showing how they have been combating the Taliban since March 2006, BBC reports. 
The images, taken with miniature cameras attached to troop helmets, are monitored by a command centre in Kandahar and then transferred to London from where they are uploaded onto the Internet. 
There's no mistaking the political message 
Fully 139 RAF images have been uploaded onto the Internet and so far over they have received over 75,000 hits. 
The UK defence ministry has been registered since spring 2007 as "defence headquarters", regularly uploading video clips on Iraqi and Afghanistani actions, while the Commonwealth Office and the Multinational Force - Iraq (MNF-I) have their own You Tube channels. 
Introduction to Afghanistan 
The RAF originally uploaded the videos as a recruitment tool. The defence ministry says they have also been a good way to let the public know the real purpose of keeping the forces abroad. 
Publicity disseminated through this avenue costs almost nothing when compared to traditional recruitment commercials on television, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told BBC. At the same time, they inadvertently carry a bit of a political message for, in a special way, they offer insight into the reasons why the government ordered the ongoing military actions. 
The Americans have turned it into a game 
A problem the military has to contend with involves the amateur videos being shared alongside the carefully edited and censured official clips, which sometimes even show dying soldiers. In the slightly hypocritical "official" clips, officers will at most talk about their losses but the bloody side of the fighting is never actually shown. 
Quite a number of videos from the Iraqi and Afghanistani battlefields showing live action have been posted on the Internet, but British forces have only recently joined in the postings. 
American recruitment is a bit different. The US has been using America's Army, a tactical shooting game available for free download, as a recruiting tool. In it players become soldiers in a more-or-less realistic simulation of fighting forces.
