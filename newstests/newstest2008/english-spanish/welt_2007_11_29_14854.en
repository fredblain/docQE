Richard Gere Just Isnt Cynical Enough 
The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden make two more films dealing with the Balkan War. 
But neither of them is convincing. 
Either the concepts put too much emphasis on action sequences and gunfire, or they are too maudlin. 
Even Richard Gere, in The Hunting Party, cant change that. 
The good news first: War criminals Karadzic and Mladic may still be hiding in the Balkan mountains. But right there, of all places, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been recovered. 
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties lately, after all too many nicely trivial roles in feel-good films for women and all too many press conferences on Buddhism had exorcised any desire to watch him. 
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the best reason why we would maybe want to watch The Hunting Party, after all. (The full German title is The Hunting Party  Wenn der Jäger zum Gejagten wird - why do film titles always have to be as long and dizzying over here as labor agreements for engine drivers?) 
His performance is delightfully tongue-in-cheek. Essentially, his war reporter Simon Hunt is who Gere could have ended up as, had fate and the film industry not been so kind to him: A man whose heyday is long past, but who has preserved considerable shreds of his former charm even as a ruin-like monument. 
Still, despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, along with the German production Mörderischer Frieden, which also debuts this week, merely continues the endless line of failed Balkan War movies. 
Mörderischer Frieden can be dealt with fairly quickly: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian woman from Kosovan snipers - and one of whom promptly falls in love with her, to boot. 
Although the fact that the Serbs, for once, arent portrayed as the sole root of all evil here is to be appreciated, the film, in its TV-like shallowness, quickly gets lost in gunfire and action sequences. 
What remains is something like the German car-chase TV show Alarm für Cobra 11, only with war taking the place of the autobahn. 
The Hunting Party, meanwhile, is kind of like exhibit A in the investigation on why theres actually never been a really good Balkan War movie. 
With another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard is both), and at another time, the story of three US war reporters committed to track down Serbian war criminal supreme The Fox might have ended up becoming a new Apocalypse Now. 
The stories, after all, are strikingly similar: In both, small teams enter the woods to accomplish something the military couldnt, and in both, the result is a journey into madness. 
One of the reasons why The Hunting Party fails is that Simon Hunt isnt allowed to simply be the run-down cynic with a heart of gold were introduced to at the beginning. 
No, the script also has to saddle him with a romantic relationship on top of that, with a Bosnian muslim woman who is killed later on. 
The Hunting Party goes off the rails altogether when the reporters, in fast-forward motion, achieve in the last five minutes what NATO, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world havent been able to achieve in five years: To catch the war criminal and leave him to the just revenge of the Bosnian muslims. 
This is so bad, it makes you want to appeal to the International Court of Justice at The Hague on the grounds of crimes against cinematic logic. 
The films concern, however, is actually a deeply human one. 
It wants to condemn the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still free as they please, and it suspects the Americans and the French (apparently they agree here, for once) of not being overly concerned with their pursuit due to secret political horse-trading. 
But good intentions and evil are so similar sometimes that a popular poem by Brecht comes to mind. 
In it, the wooden mask of an Asian demon resting on the poets working desk is described: With sympathy I regard the swollen veins on the forehead, suggesting: how hard it is, to be evil. 
Films like The Hunting Party have those very same swollen heads, in that case suggesting, however, how hard it is, to be good. 
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan War movie. 
Recently, it was reported in this paper that all Hollywood Iraq movies have utterly bombed. 
One could add: There has never been a good South Africa movie, either. 
Rule of thumb: If some star actor is running around in the hot spots or on the minefields of the world, the result is something like Rangoon, with Patricia Arquette, Beyond Borders, with Angelina Jolie, or Blood Diamond, with Leonardo DiCaprio. 
Possibly, all of these conflicts are simply to recent. 
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood was able to direct a good Holocaust movie in Schindlers List. 
Some film or other may still mature  the Vietnam works The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket, now considered to be classics, were not exactly celebrated unanimously as masterworks at the time, after all. 
Or maybe we just know too much about the violent conflicts of the world nowadays, with every instance of mass murder appearing at our homes in real time and on two screens simultaneously. 
And that robs screenwriters of the recklessness required to tell good stories. 
Part of the reason why To Be or Not to Be or The Great Dictator are such good films, after all, is that Lubitsch and Chaplin didnt yet know how bad the Nazi regimes reign really was. 
To be able to make good films, perhaps one must not want to be good. 
Perhaps a sarcastically distanced artistic view like the novelist Lawrence Norfolks is required. 
Queried on the parallels between his historical novel Lemprières Dictionary and the Balkan War, he replied: Thats just because some things never change. 
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in gruesome ways, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.
