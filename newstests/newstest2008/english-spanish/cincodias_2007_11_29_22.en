For the first time Telecinco doubles its stock market value when compared to its rival Antenna 3 
"We've done it". 
With that phrase Paolo Vasile, executive advisor of Telecinco, expressed yesterday his satisfaction at market closure, when it stated that it had reached a value of double that of its rival, Antenna 3. 
Only one aspect dimmed its joy: "It hurts me, not because we have grown more but because we have lowered less", he affirmed. 
Even so, he insisted that in a weak market, "we have fallen less". 
Telecinco closed the day with an advance of 2,54% yesterday. 
That gain puts the loss we suffered for the year at 15,66%. 
The value of the company's shares, controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%), at the stock market reached therefore the 4,488.88 million Euros, according to data from Bloomberg. 
It's rival, Antenna 3, that yielded 1.52% and which yesterday accumulated a slope of 40.5% from January, is valued at half that, 2,193.46 million. 
Shares of other quoted communication companies rise; to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable, 2518.53 million for Prisa (publisher of Five Days) and 1.779 million for Vocento. 
According to Vasile, "we are speaking of two similar companies" and hence the comparison with Antenna 3. 
"The fact is how much are we able to operate within the same market, at what cost, and how we can profit in terms of customers". 
Telecinco announced last week that it anticipates this year to become the first TV chain in surpassing the 1,000 million gross advertising income, according to Giuseppe Tringali, delegated advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the branch that manages the publicity of the group. 
If the published data is true, the television network has registered this year an increase of 3,6% in publicity revenue with respect to the 965.4 million of the 2006 exercise. 
On the other hand, the net revenue of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the exercise (reaching 734.4 million) whereas the net income of the television grew by 0.7% (630,4 million). 
One of the factors that the analysts point to as indicative of the evolution in Telecinco in the stock market is elevated payout that has been maintained until now: in 2006, the company presided by Alexander Echevarría distributed the 100% of the benefit among its shareholders. 
Vasile assures that, although it is too soon to make a decision, this ratio may change after purchasing 33% of Endemol in partnership with its parent company Mediaset. 
"Officially, we are committed to pay out a of minimum 50%, although we have always declared more. 
This year, I hope that we are able to leave our shareholders, to whom we have already given good value with 33% of Endemol", satisfied. 
According to the analysts, the market shows signs of fatigue at the moment. 
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its benefit estimates on Telecinco for 2008 to 4%, and 2009 to 7%. 
It happens, they explain, beacuse of the cut in the anticipated growth of income from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009. 
This same company has lowered the forecasted profit of Antenna 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.
