600 Thousand People Did Not Manage to Renew Driver's Licenses 
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and did not manage to renew their old driver's licenses, the validity of which will expire at the end of the year. 
Today is the last day for people to apply for the renewal so that the authorities could manage to issue the new license by the end of the year. 
However, the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would set out on the road without a valid license after New Year's Eve. 
According to the authorities, it is mostly those who do not want to drive anymore who did not renew the license. 
While villages report a sharp decline in interest in driver's license renewal, the authorities in the city are overloaded with applications and the interest in the license renewal has grown this week. 
The municipal council handles about 2000 clients a day. 
They spend about half an hour waiting in line. 
Roughly 140,000 drivers have not renewed their driver's license yet in Prague. 
The issue of a new license takes twenty days. 
However, it is possible to apply for the issue in the reduced time limit of five days. 
In that case, the driver pays five hundred crowns extra. 
Motorists who do not manage the renewal of the license before the end of the year and set on the road without a valid driver's license will be threatened with a fine. 
A person who breaks the law will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns. 
But the police can also settle the offense through a settlement. 
In case of an administrative offense, the fine will climb to 2,500 crowns. 
According to earlier information the council could even fine someone who does not drive at all. 
Reportedly, such an individual could have paid up to 30,000 crowns. 
The ministry earlier asked the authorities to be reasonable and issue a thousand-crown fine at the most. 
However, according to Ministry of Transport speaker Karel Hanzelka, nobody will be threatened with ten-thousand-crown fines. 
According to him, a driver's license is a document which the people should be allowed to decide whether they want or not. 
It is not an identity card which everybody must keep validated. 
Those who do not want to drive anymore should give the license up. 
It is sufficient to take it to the competent municipal office or send it by registered post. 
By the end of the year, the validity of the licenses issued during 1964-1993 will have expired. 
However, motorists must also subsequently renew other types of driver's licenses. 
People with driver's licenses from 1994-2000 have three more years for the renewal. 
The validity of the licenses issued 2001-2004 will end in December 2013. 
According to Hanzelka, this concerns roughly 2.6 million other documents.
