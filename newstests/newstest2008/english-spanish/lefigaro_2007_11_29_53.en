Extraordinary rapair on the space station 
The astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates of the Interntional Space Station (ISS) spent more than seven hours working in space, repairing a mangled solar array, indispensable to continue the scientific activities of the station. 
A dangerous spacewalk which set a record in its lenght, its distance from habitable module, its rapidity and in the «repairing» tools used by the astronauts. 
The problem came out on Tuesday, when the astronauts pulled the Harmony module from the Discovery space shuttle, a big cylindrical piece charged of holding both European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see figure). 
This module is a sort of deck landing for the modules-laboratories. 
But it is necessary to provide them with elecrticity. 
In order to produce electricity, then, the second task of the crew was to move a 17,5 tons module for solar arrays, which was already in the ISS. 
After having moved the module, the crew started using its solar arrays, which have a wingspan of 76 meters. 
It was there that a solar array, bending like an accordion, was mangled by a rope. 
In order to avoid further damages, the array was stopped from bending. 
The astronauts, whose spacewalk's aim was to check the Discovery shuttle and repair another solar array with a faulty rotation system, had to repair the damaged one too. 
And Scott Parazynski was choosen for the stitching, on the end of the 58-foot robot arm that was added up for the rapair. 
He is one of the best NASA spacewalker. 
He's tall, strong, very capable, he has a great chest and long arms. 
At the age of 46, with a past medical carriere, he was charged of « operate » on that « wounded » solar array. 
After having examined the damages, he dissected the wrong rope and fixed a sort of « splint » on the mangled area. 
He has been helped by another spacewalker who stayed next to him, while his crew and its leader Peggy Whitson was helping him from the inside. 
The tool he used, a tiny hockey stick wrapped in insulator in order to avoid electrocution on the solar arrays producing hundreds of volts, was planned and created in the space station. 
At the end of the operation, before checking his tools and coming back to the station, Scott Parazynski waited for the solar array to be completely unfolded. 
Yesterday, in the afternoon, the astronautes had a half day of rest, while seven astronautes are today ready to leave on the Discovery shuttle, coming back to Earth on Wednesday.
