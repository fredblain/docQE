An Account of the Baby Switch: 12 million 
The lawyer for the aggrieved families, Igor Veleba, is requesting 12 million Czech crowns in compensation for the switch of the babies in a maternity clinic in the Třebíč hospital, plus legal expenses. 
Three million for each of the mothers, two for each father and a million for each child. 
The hospital is offering a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents. 
The hospital's attorney, Ondřej Dostál, therefore radically disapproves of Veleba's proposition. 
"We reject such a claim, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting. 
"To be able to define our position to the counter-motion, we need the expert opinion the opposing side has had made. 
We will find out if it has any informative value at all. 
Still, we stick to our opinion that it is going to be in hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál stressed. 
According to him, the sum should range from 100,000 to 200,000 for each of the four parents. 
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family demanded a million crowns for each month they were not with their biological daughter. 
Veleba used the expert opinion which the Motol University Hospital in Prague had elaborated for him as a basis for the negotiations. 
According to the advisors in the field of psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children have suffered psychological injury and stress of various degrees and intensity. 
The stressful situation was better endured by the men, though they struggled with remorse that they did not prevent the switch of the newborn babies. 
On the other hand, the women are coping worse with the urgency of the trauma experienced and of what is happening right now, Veleba summed up. 
Veronika and Nikola were switched by the nurses in the Třebíč maternity clinic on December 9 of the last year. 
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks to Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov. 
Vysočina county supervisor Miloš Vystrčil gave 100,000 CZK to each of the families as compensation for the expenditures that ensued from the mistake by the Třebíč hospital, run by the county. 
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured for the liability for damages by law. 
In case of error, they have to dig into the reserve fund, and in exceptional cases they can seek help from the founder. 
By now the courts have awarded relatively low compensation to people, with the sums calculated according to the tables in six digit numbers, exceptionally in seven digit numbers, in Czech crowns.
