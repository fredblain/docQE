Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has heightened the country's risk level 
Actions by the Hungarian Guard, established in August with the support of the Movement for a Righter Hungary, has raised the political risk level of Hungary and the entire region from a number of aspects, according to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital. 
The research entity issued a "risk warning," writing: the actions of the Hungarian Guard are triggering an exceeding political risk "that the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy residents of Hungary could heat up to toxic levels as early as the short-term, leading to ethnic conflicts that could turn violent." 
The major reason for this is that Hungarian Guard's political strategy appears to be aimed at provoking action of this nature, the research institute added. 
This is the outcome of one of the most serious failures of Hungary's political players: "The primary actors in public life turned over public debate of Roma issues to representatives of the radical and extremist political forces, who have built a political strategy out of Gypsy-Hungarian differences." 
This, Political Capital believes, has intensified the problem, rendering any normal dialogue impossible, reinforcing the extremists, and heightening the probability that violent conflicts will occur. 
In addition, the research institute believes that the extensive domestic and international media attention to Hungarian Guard actions has "significantly damaged Hungary's international image, particularly as regards belief in the stability of the country and in the sophistication of its democracy." 
They point out that the increasing publicity and impetus given to the re-organization of radical and far right groups in Hungary starting in the autumn of 2006 have been part of the reason why a number of organizations calling themselves "national self-defence" alliances were established starting in the summer of 2007. 
"The common feature of these groups is that they call themselves civic organizations while openly declaring that they are preparing their members for defensive - including armed - tasks (citing disaster management, national defence, law enforcement) while declaring that the police and armed forces, in other words, the government, is unsuited for the role," Political Capital adds. 
They noted that all of these moves have been made within a configuration that relies on society's anti-politics and anti-political-party mood to cloak various political ambitions under a mantle of civic action. 
In other words, their emphasis on the civic nature of their actions and their choice of the association as their organizational form are not merely ruses to sidestep legal pitfalls to registration with the courts, but are also part of a political strategy. 
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is heightening the risk of damaging our relations with our neighbours, too. 
"In recent months several of Hungary's neighbours have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential hazard. The ultranationalist political players among some of these neighbours have referred to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard as an argument to justify their own anti-Hungarian policies. 
All of these factors influence the political stability of the region," it adds. 
The research institute notes that the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, and as such it heightens the political risk for the whole of the region. 
It notes that the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, established in August 2007 by the far right Bulgarian National Union. (BNU). 
Serious conflicts that broke out between Roma and non-Roma in a Sofia district (Krasna Polyana) were behind the establishment of the Bulgarian guard. 
BNU took advantage of the disturbances to establish its guard, claiming that the goal of the organization was "national self-defence." 
They argued that during the past 17 years Bulgaria had been subject to "Gypsy terror," in which the government was helpless and indifferent, Political Capital noted. 
The initiative triggered heated debate among the Bulgarian public, it added. 
One sign that the risk of ethnic conflict has increased, the analysts wrote, is that some Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced plans to establish a guard of their own as a resistance force. 
Since the Hungarian Guard has so far acted quite similarly to the Bulgarian National Guard, it is quite possible that the Roma community of Hungary could respond to the threat by organizing their own self-defence, wrote Political Capital in warning of the risk. 
Political Capital research manager Attila Juh√°sz responded to a query from the MTI Hungarian wire service by saying that risk analysis was one of the research institute's chief activities. 
Each year, he said, they publish risk analyses, and if they discover any factor that might alter risks, they notify public opinion by publishing a risk warning, as they have now done.
