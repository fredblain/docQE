Schäuble Warns of French Riots in Germany 
Clashes with the police, shots fired, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots similar to those in France. 
Any steps necessary to prevent social discontent in Germany from escalating in public displays of violence needed to be taken, the German Federal Secretary of the Interior demanded. 
Barricades were set aflame and rioters fired shotguns at the police: In the wake of the massive youth riots in France, German Federal Secretary of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble, of the Christian Democratic Union, fears similar developments in Germany. 
We have to prevent the rise of social tensions which may escalate in violence. 
We need to take this seriously, he told the Hannover-based daily newspaper Neue Presse. 
Some young adults were finding it difficult to adjust to a social reality that is changing ever more quickly, he said. 
Federal, state and local governments were already hard at work on the issues, said Schäuble. 
These were not limited to the integration of migrants, he added. 
Between the German Summit for Integration and the Conference on German-Islamic Affairs, we are beginning to see results. 
But it was too early to sound the all-clear, he said. 
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that German suburbs were not suffering from the same urban-construction and sociological issues as their French counterparts. 
In suburbs north of Paris, there had been violent clashes between youths and the police in recent nights. 
Cars and public buildings were set on fire in Toulouse, as well. 
Kenan Kolat, Chairman of the Community of Turks in Germany, is asking the German Federal Government to step up its integration efforts, meanwhile. 
In light of the riots in France, Kolat warned of copycat effects. 
The situation in Germany was not as urgent as in France, he said. 
But there was still a need for action. 
The unemployment rate among youths with a migrational background below the age of 25 was above average, Kolat noted. 
Above all, more vocational training positions needed to be provided. 
We need to provide options to these youths, Kolat emphasized. 
However, the Chairman of the Community of Turks added that a social supervision in families applied in Germany more than it did in France. 
In addition, many youths did not want to destroy what their parents had built for themselves in Germany, he said. 
We still need to be careful, Kolat urged. 
Youths needed to be given the opportunity to participate in labor and education. 
In the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel, the night remained quiet, meanwhile. 
Hundreds of policemen were on alert, and a helicopter circled the area with searchlights. 
The responsible authorities reported three arrests as well as a number of burning garbage cans and cars. 
Since the day before, a security force of 1000 has been keeping the peace. 
After visiting the suburb, Secretary of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced that police crackdowns would continue as long as necessary. 
During the night of Monday, about 80 policemen were harmed in riots. 
In the following night, the unrest encroached upon Toulouse. 
The riots were ignited by a traffic accident which had caused the deaths of two youths on Sunday. 
According to an intial investigation by the Office of the District Attorney, the police were not to blame in the two youths deaths.
