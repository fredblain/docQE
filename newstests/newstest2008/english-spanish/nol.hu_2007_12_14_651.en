Holidays: Not everyone gets to enjoy the red-letter days 
Hungarian law names the red-letter days specifically, and reorganizing working days to increase the number of days off around the holidays has become a general practice, although next year we will not see quite so much reorganization. 
Holidays are not uniform in the EU or the USA either. 
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes among national holidays, state/bank holidays, and non-working days. 
Non-working days are for the most part religious holidays and anniversaries of significant historical events. 
Hungary celebrates New Year's Eve and Day: the final day of the old year and the first day of the new one are both non-working days - the latter if for no other reason, then to recover from New Year's Eve festivities. 
There are a total of eleven red-letter days in each calendar year. 
March 15 is a national holiday commemorating the revolution of 1848 while October 23 commemorates the revolution of 1956. 
August 20 marks the founding of the nation, while May Day is Labour Day. On November 1 and 2 we commemorate the dead, remembering our friends and relatives who have left us. 
In addition, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas are each two-day holidays.. 
Since our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend, it has become customary to reorganize the working week when there is only a single workday between the holiday and the weekend. 
The long weekend comes with a price however, which is to have to spend the preceding or succeeding Saturday at work or in school. 
For many years, the minister of labour has issued decrees naming the days on which we have to work to get extra day off between the holiday and the weekend. 
The decree covers all employers and all workers they employ, as well as civil servants and public employees. 
It does not cover staff in facilities, businesses or institutions that regularly operate round-the-clock, and where staff works 24/7. 
The last changes this year will be around the end-of-year holidays. As of December 24, the whole country will come to a halt, for we have learned that most people find ways to take off the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, either by saving vacation days or by working longer hours before and after the holidays and taking comp time. 
Next year most holidays will come during mid-week, so where will be less manipulation of the calendar than this year. 
The first re-organization of the working week will occur to accommodate May Day and allow working people to have four consecutive days off. 
Saturday, April 26 will be a workday, and in exchange, Friday, May 2 will be a day off. 
The working week will be turned about again around the October 23 holiday. Saturday, October 18 will be a workday so that people may have Friday, October 24 off. 
The end of the year, however, will be wall-to-wall holidays, with most people enjoying time off from December 24 through the New Year, even though New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
