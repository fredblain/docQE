'Enriched uranium' seized by police 
A kilo of radioactive material, reported to be enriched uranium, was seized by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday. 
A police spokesman said three people had been arrested and the material was being examined. 
He would not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (Â£480,000).
