Government crisis coming, says Gallup 
Fidesz support shot up significantly in early December after a lengthy period of just holding its own. This gives it the strongest support base it has seen since 2002, while Gallup reports support for the socialists at an all-time low of 13 percent. 
Among people with a clear party preference, given the stronger resolve of opposition voters, Fidesz support exceeds the two-thirds mark (71 percent), while MSZP has garnered but one-fifth (20 percent). 
The poll puts MDF and SZDSZ numbers below the threshold needed to get into parliament; garnering about 2 percent support each within the entire sample. 
Among people with clear party preferences who say they definitely would vote, support for these two parties is 3 percent each. 
The public mood regarding the economy has managed to sink even lower than the rock-bottom last measured. The proportion who believe the country's economy is in the pits is an unprecedented 41 percent, while another 46 percent just think it is in bad shape. 
Following higher hopes in spring and summer, people are again more pessimistic about the financial prospects for their families. 
For next year, over half the public expects things to get worse and only one in ten predicts an improvement. 
In Gallup's December poll, more respondents than ever before - 71 percent - said the prime minister was doing a poor rather than a good job. 
Thirteen percent of the sample said it trusted or highly trusted Ferenc Gyurcsány, while 38 percent put their trust in Viktor Orbán. 
Fifty-four percent said they did not trust the PM, while 27 percent said they mistrusted the Fidesz chairman. 
One gauge of the political situation is the proportion of people who believe that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be managed without having to put a new government in office. 
Following last October's rioting, 35 percent of the public thought it would be best to keep the government and PM in office. By now that proportion is down to 20 percent and the relative majority (33 percent) believes new elections should be held. 
When queried about interest in a referendum, 60 percent of the sample said it definitely would vote in one, while another 20 percent said it most likely would go to to the polls. 
In comparison, only 55 percent said it would definitely vote "in parliamentary elections if they were to be held this Sunday" while another 15 percent said it most likely would cast a ballot. Given current determination to vote, the referendum is certain to be valid. 
74 percent of people want to repeal tuition fees, 79 percent to scrap co-payments for doctor visits and 84 percent want to end per diem hospital charges. 
Looking only at the ratios of people who say they definitely will vote in the referendum, we find that 81 percent are against tuition fees, 84 percent are against doctor co-payments and 89 percent oppose hospital per diems.
