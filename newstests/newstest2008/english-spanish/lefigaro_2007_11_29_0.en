Many people were questioned. 
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the bar of the Supreme Court pulled a strike and announced future demonstrations, after a wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, human rights militants and lawyers during the week-end. 
The roads leading to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning for avoiding the meeting. 
Other demonstrations took place in Multan (in the centre) and in Peshawar (in the North-West). 
The lawyers' movement received on Monday the support of the religious parties gathered in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "urged the population to send flowers to the judges who declared themselves against the state of emergency and wastes to those who swore an oath in front of Musharraf". 
"Musharraf breaks his promise" 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly concerned with emergency measures which were announced on Saturday evening. 
In the next days, it was expected to take a decision on the legality of president Musharraf's re-election, which took place the 6th October. 
The Court president, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been ousted and replaced. 
''All that we are attending is illegal, anticonstitutional and against the measures of the Supreme Court'', declared the magistrate to News newspaper. 
The promise of Pervez Musharraf of becoming a civil president is broken with the announcement of the state of emergency, declared on Monday the Information minister Tariq Azeem. 
He was expected to leave the army by the 15th November, with the expiration of his first presidential mandate. 
Moreover, the Information minister confirmed that the elections of January could be deferred. 
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied those rumours accoeding to which president Musharraf would have been under house arrest.
