The public prosecutor of the Balkan 
Carla del Ponte has been eight years implacably pursuing the war criminals of the Balkans from the public prosecutor's office of the Penal Court for the ex- Yugoslavia, located in The Hague. 
Her mandate expires at the end of year and Carla will go with bittersweet flavour, because people responsible for the Srebrenica's slaughter - where 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died, the ex-general Ratko Mladic and the ex-Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large. 
Their names are in the list from which the Swiss documentary, produced by Marcel Sch√ºpbach, takes its title, "Carla's list" (2006, not released in Spain), which has the pace of a police thriller, and follows the work of the Swiss public prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to prosecute the fleeing criminals and pressure the governments concerned to strengthen the siege.
