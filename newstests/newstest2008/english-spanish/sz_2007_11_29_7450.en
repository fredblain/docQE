Attack Department 
In the Youtube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, favorites Rudy Guiliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough exchange of blows  and now have to fear an underdog candidate. 
The candidates tension is finding release as early as at the first subject. 
Mitt Romney accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani of turning New York into a safe haven for illegal immigrants. 
The latter counters with bold allegations of his own: I would say his own home was a safe haven for illegals, Giuliani retorts, charging the former Governor of Massachusetts with having privately employed immigrants without paperwork. 
The candidates mount the attack: Because the Republican base still lacks a clear favorite, the eight presidential contenders use the CNN debate, first and foremost, to discredit their opponents. 
The self-made 30-second videos submitted via Youtube by internet users contribute little more than cues. 
This is the kind of isolationism which allowed Hitler to rise to power, John McCain accuses opponent Ron Paul, the only one in the group demanding an instant withdrawal from Iraq. 
Romney, too, is sharply reprimanded by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to denounce the so-called waterboarding, an interrogation technique which simulates drowning, as torture. 
However, audience reactions in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that the important issues of the campaign are far off from the Iraq War and the torture debates. 
Whenever conservative values are praised and the notion of future tax increases is rejected, there is applause from the auditorium. 
In the process, the two favorites weak spots once more become apparent. 
I was wrong back then, a remorseful Romney announces, apologizing to base and audience for having endorsed abortion as recently as in 1994. 
Giuliani faltered when asked about his opinion on taking the Bible literally, meanwhile.
