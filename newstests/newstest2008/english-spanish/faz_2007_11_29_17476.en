United Internet Major Shareholder at Versatel 
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of telecommunications company Versatel. 
The average price per share was 14.46 euros, the company announced on Wednesday evening. 
It was now holding 20.05 percent in share capital, it said. 
The announcement followed speculation about a takeover. 
Options to increase its holding of Versatel were being kept open, the company said. 
According to United Internet, the move is intended to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market. 
Earlier on Wednesday, there had already been speculation about an acquisition of shares after Berenberg Bank had increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by another five percent, to 15.1 percent. 
The bank was merely holding the shares for a third party, rumors in the financial market suggested. 
On the previous day, United Internet had already bought into mobile telecommunications operator Drillisch with around ten percent. 
In the context of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million in new shares, with a total value of 106.4 million euros. 
Of those, United Internet bought 5.15 million shares at 31.4 million euros total. 
Further, the companies are in talks over marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile telecommunications products. 
We are strengthening our partnership, a spokesman for United Internet explained. 
The two companies have founded the joint venture MSP in order to buy competitor Freenet. 
For the time being, the two companies will settle for a share of approximately ten percent and not make use of their option to buy another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday. 
However, the two companies were keeping all their options open, especially with a view to increasing their share of Freenet AG, it was said. 
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had been aborted in mid-November. 
The months-long and at this stage fairly intransparent power struggle over Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunication market. 
At the close of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and fixed-line customers. 
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch has, so far, directly held 6.01 percent of Freenet shares. 
Now, it had been arranged for Drillisch to acquire another four percent, it was said. 
The option to buy 18.49 percent from investment company Vatas had already been arranged back in August.
