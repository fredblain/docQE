They haven't reached any accord on the province's future statute on Wednesday, during the last negotiations' session in Vienna. 
At the end, the failure. 
Serbians and Kosovo's Albanians completed on Wednesday morning in Baden, in Austria, the sixth and last session of negotiations without managing in overcoming their differences on the futur statute of the separatist province. 
«It is regrettable that the parties haven't been able to reach an accord on the statute», declared the european mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna. 
Emphasizing that the peace in the region was «at stake», his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations. 
«For the time being, violence is not forseen but we're entering a very difficult period», he has added, highlighting the «existence of important tensions». 
End of the mediation on 10th december. 
Troika mediators, which gathers the Europian Union, USA and Russia, will go for the last time to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday. 
The future of the province populated 90% by Albanian-speaking people will probably be clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will have submitted their report to the UN Security Council, by the 10th December. 
Baden's discussions, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika was charged with a new mediation by the United Nations, last August. 
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on the 10th December. 
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence to Kosovo, are insisting on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline. 
«Russia has been and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution», said Botsane-Khartchenko. 
Unilateral Declaration of Independence? 
After eight years of United Nations administration in Kosovo, Westerners believed that independence under supervision of the EU is the only viable solution. 
Pristina is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council won't be in its favour. 
Belgrade is insisting on an increased autonomy. 
«Unfortunately, no agreement was reached», announced the president of the self-rule authority in Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden's hotel where these "last chance" negotiations were taking place since Monday. 
Hashim Thaci, the ex-commander of Kosovo rebels and future prime minister of the province, expressed its regret. 
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade «belonged to a past which led to murders and deportations». 
«Domino effect» 
The Serbian President Boris Tadic suggested that a compromise was still possible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of independence for the province. 
Belgrade fears a «domino effect» in a fragile region, weakened by the indipendence wars of the 1990s. 
«For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.» 
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that every decision should be up to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto. 
«Kosovo's Parliament will have the last word» 
«There's just one acceptable solution for Serbia within the Security Council», declared the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica. 
«Those negotiations have been going on for two years. 
«They should end as they began: within the Security Council.» 
Fatmir Sedjiu answered the journalists that «Kosovo's Parliament will have the last word on the statute», adding that every unilateral declaration of independence coming from Albanian-speaking people would be done by consulting the Westerners.
