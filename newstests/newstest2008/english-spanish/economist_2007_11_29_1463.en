Labour pains 
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another hole to fall into; his way out of it remains the same 
As British political scandals go, this one is not particularly juicy. 
No honours seem to have been sold, no politician's Parisian hotel bills picked up, no extramarital toes sucked. 
But the revelation that a rich businessman disguised contributions to Britain's governing Labour Party of more than Â£650,000 ($1.3m) over four years under other people's names, and that the party failed to report it, is one the embattled Gordon Brown could well have done without. 
Two months ago, when the prime minister ducked out of calling an election, stupidly insulting Britons' intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, the hope was that he would provide sturdy, efficient government. 
Instead, as Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats' increasingly witty stand-in leader, put it, the once feared Mr Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr Bean. 
The cackhanded rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire. 
Ill-thought-out proposals to change the tax code have drawn business groups together against the government. 
The tax authority's loss of 25m people's personal details revealed unimaginable administrative bungling. 
A trio of retired generals launched a mutiny in the Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being armed-forces minister is, they claimed, a part-time job. 
Now there are the multifaceted donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's general secretary (and its previous head of compliance), has already resigned. 
None of this means that Mr Brown is headed irrevocably for the exit. 
Yet governments can reach a tipping point after which they find it impossible to govern. 
People neither like nor trust politicians, but usually suspend their disbelief when a new lot takes over. 
Once it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve things, and may not even be around for long, that suspension is over: the civil service starts leaking; cabinet ministers start briefing; the press looks for bad-news stories; and government becomes defensive and unfocused. 
In one way, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot claim to be a new broom. 
Much though he would like to disown Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant. 
The problems to do with Northern Rock and the tax-authority records, for instance, are linked to decisions Mr Brown made as chancellor of the exchequer. 
And even when he was not directly involved in Blairish mishaps - such as the long "cash for peerages" inquiry into political-party funding - voters may well assume he was. 
Yet Mr Brown's predicament is not quite as bad as it looks. 
The gaffes are not as appalling as the Tories are making out. 
As with Mr Bean, no one has died, or been swindled outright. 
And the remedy, painful though it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown's natural Stalinist tendencies have always promised: reliable, sound and slightly brutal government. 
The new fuss about political donations is a good example. 
The Garboesque Mr Abrahams, who compares his donations to his charitable giving, says he wished no public recognition for his benevolence. 
That may be so, but the decision was not his to make. 
The laws against anonymity for big political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public is entitled to know who may be buying access to those who rule the land. 
Mr Watt, who says he knew of Mr Abrahams's arrangement but not that it was illegal, will obviously face some close questioning; so will Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief fund-raiser who was told about the dodgy donations in October. 
But so far Mr Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these convolutions, even though the bulk of the payments were made after he took office in June. 
So far the prime minister has done half the job. 
He was quick to condemn his party's breach of the law, but he diluted that decisiveness by reaching for a familiar tool, a committee of inquiry into the matter - led, for good measure, by a retired bishop and a judge. 
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not complicated. 
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police. 
Besides, there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been without one for six months, and pressing ahead with genuine reform of political-party funding. 
That would require hard-up Labour to co-operate with the Tories and perhaps give up its special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a partisan like Mr Brown. 
But he should face some partisan facts. 
The Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can grind out a victory is through unimpeachable probity and solid competence.
