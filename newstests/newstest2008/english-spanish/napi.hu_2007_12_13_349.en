Auchan prices are highest, Tesco's are up by almost 20 percent 
The giant supermarkets located in the shopping triangle at Budaörs hiked prices by an average of 16 percent for the second year in a row, though they did not have to contend with a VAT increase which they did last year. 
Article from Napi Gazdaság 
Prices In Napi's usual Christmas basket were up by an average of 16 percent again this year in the Budaörs shopping triangle, with each of the giant supermarkets pushing prices up by well over a thousand forints. 
Since supermarket prices went through the roof last December, the hikes did not look quite as drastic percentage-wise, when compared to that high base. 
Nonetheless, it has to be a shock to consumers to discover that they need over ten thousand forints to buy the same products they could get for well under nine thousand a year ago. 
Napi's basket exceeded the psychological HUF 10,000 limit by a minimum of HUF 91 at the giant supermarkets tested. 
The most expensive basket cost us 10 573 forints. 
(in 2003, the same basket came to 6,800 forints.) 
The price of Unicum and live fish stayed at roughly last year's level, but boneless turkey breast, walnuts, and poppy seeds were up significantly. 
We found the price of flour and bread to be mostly in line with official Statistics Office data, though we discovered bread going for 139 forints a kilogram at Auchan. 
The competition factor was not enough to push the product's price down to under 200 forints. 
Another surprise in this store was that it charged less than 200 forints for a two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola in a bottle with a deposit on it, so the full price including deposit was still only 257 forints. 
Nevertheless, this year Napi's basket cost the most at Auchan and the least at Cora. 
We worked the numbers and found that Napi's basket cost 15 percent more than last Christmas at Cora, while it was 18 percent more expensive at both Tesco and Auchan. 
The difference between last year's most expensive and this year's cheapest basket cost was 12 percent, while the gap between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive one was 21 percent. 
In forints, the average increase was 1,480. 
Last year, the average increase came to 1,206 forints, which included the effects of a VAT hike. 
And this was the factor that totally confused the commerce sector. The supermarkets were obviously unable to decide on the size of the price gap to apply to specific products, finding it impossible to calculate the effect the price increases would have on consumption. 
(If the outlet makes a mistake in calculating the turnover velocity of a product, it stands to take a major hit on its profits with a price gap adjusted to turnover intensity.) 
Last year, with the VAT hike the price increase in Napi's basket ran up against such extremes that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints over the 2006 level, while the cheapest was only 844 forints more expensive. 
This year, there were no such extremes, with the most expensive basket being 1,630 forints up from last year while the cheapest was 1,284 forints higher. 
A comparison of the two Christmas seasons threw light on a disastrous jump in prices. In less than 20 months, day-to-day consumer goods soared by over 30 percent in the giant supermarkets. 
(This is not quite in line with official Statistics Office data: its figures show price increases of over 30 percent in just 12 months for certain basic foodstuffs 
including both flour and eggs.) 
Napi's basket suggested that this latter was a near impossibility, since we found that the price was was up by just a shade over 10 percent on last year's quite high base price, even where it was most expensive. 
It does appear though, that flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg producers, for they have managed to force their drastic price increases onto the multinationals. 
Nonetheless, none of the supermarkets in the golden shopping triangle were complaining. All regularly reported that they were having a good year. 
We found that most shoppers in the three outlets visited were not really interested in prices. 
They tended to shop in bulk, buying durable foodstuffs by the pallet. 
On a Wednesday morning there were long queues at all cash registers following a sudden increase in shoppers. 
However, to our knowledge, turnover is lower in the rural areas. Several of the multis have been complaining to pollsters that their inflow has been below the anticipated level in both groceries and durable consumers.
