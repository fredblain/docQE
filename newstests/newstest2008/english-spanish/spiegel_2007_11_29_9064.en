Köhler Defends Merkels Meeting with Dalai Lama 
German Federal President Köhler is demanding an end to the party dispute on the Dalai Lamas formal reception at the Federal Chancellery. 
He indirectly criticized the Social Democratic Party because of its attacks on the chancellor after Septembers meeting. 
Worried about Germanys reputation, German Federal President Horst Köhler asked the grand coalition to end its dispute on the Dalai Lamas formal reception. 
We should not face the world as a nation that is divided on this issue, Köhler told the trade journal Handelsblatt. 
At the same time, Köhler signaled his appreciation of the Dalai Lamas formal reception by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, a Christian Democrat, in September. 
I consider human rights to be universal, even though I respect the diversity of cultures, Köhler said. 
The President stressed that everyone was aware of Germanys obligation to maintain delicate balances in foreign affairs. However, he defended Merkel against charges of pursuing a new policy with reference to China. 
The Chancellor has not departed from our traditional policy towards China. 
China is aware of this, too, Köhler said. 
Secretary of State Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a Social Democrat, had indirectly expressed displeasure at the Dalai Lamas formal reception, leading to attacks from the ranks of the Christian Democratic Union. 
Among other things, Steinmeier had criticized what he called the Unions showcase mentality in foreign affairs. 
In the wake of the Dalai Lamas formal reception at the Federal Chancellery, there had been severe discordances in German-Chinese relations. 
For instance, the Chinese government not only disinvited German Secretary of the Treasury Peer Steinbrück, a Social Democrat; according to news magazine Der Spiegel, it also suspended the so-called strategical dialogue between the two countries State Departments. 
Chinas head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to concede that the Dalai Lamas formal reception was a mistake. 
Stating Chinas disapproval of European officials receiving the spiritual leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao underlined the Chinese position. 
The Dalai Lamas actions and words showed his intention to separate Tibet and the broader Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China, Wen Jiabao said.
