The Fathers of Krautrock Are Back 
Germanys supergroup of the seventies is reunited: At a concert in Berlin, the three band members of Harmonia once again grabbed their mixing consoles. 
To celebrate the reunion, Live 1974, a recording from their heyday, is released. 
Even back then, they were much more famous abroad than in Germany. 
The arranged sensation, then, occurs in the shape of three composed gentlemen at the dinner table. 
Each of them has his little box in front of them, his wires and, most significantly, his keys. 
Dieter Moebius, 63, wearing a pristine white shirt, is throning at the center. 
At his left flank is Michael Rother, a paltry 57, wielding a laptop computer and a guitar. 
And at the right, from the auditoriums point of view, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is bent over a mixing console in concentration. 
Each of them is contributing noises, sometimes even a beat. 
And once in a while, it inadvertently fuses into a conventional piece of music. 
The gentlemen themselves do not seem overly bothered when it does, either. 
The band Harmonias reunion has caused some excitement among Krautrock aficionados. 
Although, it may be disclosed here: Specific inquiries uncovered that while the name was buzzing through collective pop memory, it was not so forcefully as to have this band being sorely missed for 32 years. 
But why should Germans not be allowed to celebrate their living legends from the seventies, too? 
Especially given that what is misleadingly called Krautrock had always been held in more esteem in England or America than at home. 
When the music industry gave an Echo Honorary Award to the survivors of Cologne group Can in 2003, quite a few quizzical German pop faces were to be seen in the room. 
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers proceeded to thank the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their panegyric, the bewilderment knew no bounds. 
At shows later on, Michael Rother sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, like an old pal. 
The problem with the ignorance at home and a misty-eyed view abroad is one thing. 
Harmonia overtaxes the brain for the simple reason that the trio existed for two years only, making much less of an impression in that period than others would attest in hindsight. 
Moebius and Roedelius had earlier collaborated with artist Conrad Schnitzler, under the promising name Cluster. 
Initially, they played in the basement of the Schaubühne in Berlin. 
After that, for economical reasons, for a record label owned by the church, in Düsseldorf. 
Rother had briefly helped out Kraftwerk, and had subsequently made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, at the time perhaps the most radical German group. 
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile, to Forst, in the Weser Highland. 
There, at the Alte Weserhof, an old ruin dating to the 16th century, they lived as communards, away from the cities. 
Less ideologically than at Kommune I, where Roedelius had once labored as a nanny. 
But rather living the Spitzwegian life of an artist. 
Allegedly, a banneret of the Glee Club Harmonia Ottenstein was found amid some scrap, and thus, a name for their art. 
Quite a bit of that was documented by Harmonia. 
The first album was called Musik von Harmonia, the next one De Luxe. 
Because, as relaxed and modest as the music may have sounded, the band was in great need, materially. 
The brushwood collecting was not just for self-discovery purposes. 
The newly released CD Live 1974 was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record audience of 50, as somebody seems to recall. 
It was Rother, back then, who wanted to push Harmonia and practice occasionally. 
For Roedelius and Moebius, it was an unethical proposition. 
The band declared its split in 1975. 
Rother ended up in the esoteric-spherical field and earned his livelihood with albums such as Flammende Herzen. 
Cluster became fashionable again in the eighties, and went on to be more successful than Harmonia ever was. 
The Griessem live album is owed to Herbert Grönemeyer. 
His record label Grönland aims to preserve Krautrock as Germanys own distinct contribution to lively music. 
Neu! has already been exhumed in the process, as has Roedelius solo work. 
The in-the-flesh resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the Berlin House of Cultures of the World. 
Publicly funded, as part of the Worldtronics Festival. 
Julian Cope is there, Brit, former punk and author of the handbook Krautrock Sampler. 
So is Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte. 
Which offers a sketch of the whole range of influence Krautrock had on subsequent pop music. 
Harmonias part is to fill the gap of the supergroup. 
Along with the idiosyncratic sound, Brian Enos dictum is hovering in the room: The only true music, the future belongs to it. 
Images of the producer, in a farmhouse room with Harmonia, appear. 
Projections of further black-and-white fotos showing woozily wired machinery do their part in the making of a legend. 
In front of it all, the three veterans are once again improvising. 
No longer by sticking microphones to organ and drums in order to get the instruments to produce unheard sounds via the self-made effects devices. 
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music. 
Three tinkerers preoccupied with technical aspects. 
Even the resident choir doesnt change that. 
Directed by Barbara Morgenstern, there is coughing and whispering beneath clouds of sound, and, at one beautiful point, Aaaaaaaah! is sung, with emphasis. 
Krautrock, after all, has always been a very English term. 
It never was rock. 
The roots were to be found less in blues than at conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster). 
Those now exclaiming 68! are not entirely wrong, but, even now, Harmonia still dont lose their cool over it. 
On the stage, even the most self-evident things are considered most thoroughly. 
Where does music start, and when does it end? 
It can wreck your nerves, or it can grant fleeting moments of great happiness.
