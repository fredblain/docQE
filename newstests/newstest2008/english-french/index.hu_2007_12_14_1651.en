Many hospitals try to save by cutting disinfectant use 
Hospitals have registered over a thousand cases of infections triggered mainly by the inappropriate use of antibiotics. 
Hospital cleanliness, overcrowding, and overburdened staff are not conducive to halting infections, said the division chief at the National Centre for Epidemiology. 
Many places even try cutting back on disinfectant use to save money. 
An MRSA - an antibiotic resistant staphylococcus - infection was recently diagnosed in the traumatology ward of János hospital. 
The infection was detected in a man who had been hospitalized after a major accident. 
The patient was isolated. 
The same hospital had had to contend with a similar infection early this year. 
It had discharged a patient admitted after a serious traffic accident. Shortly afterward, it had to re-admit the patient because of an MRSA infection, and doctors have been unable to perform surgery that would be vital to full recovery because they have been unable to get rid of the staph. 
This year, up to 10th of December, hospitals have reported 1,094 cases of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said National Centre for Epidemiology physician-in-chief Karolina Böröcz. 
This tells us the number of cases of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that hospitals actually included in their records, but nothing more. 
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSAs, whose official name is a methicillin (oxacillin) resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 
One-third of all people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without it ever causing an infection. 
The infections SA does cause (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, minor skin infections, and wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated. 
However, if antibiotics are overused or inappropriately used, the bacteria that originally responded well to antibiotics can evolve into an antibiotic-resistant variety, which spreads rapidly in hospitals if hygienic conditions are lax. 
Particularly at risk are elderly and low-body-weight patients whose immune systems have been temporarily or permanently compromised. Among these patients, the staph can cause serious nosocomial infections such as wound infections or sepsis. 
According to János Hospital's medical director, there is nothing unusual about having an MRSA infection since they are part of everyday hospital life. 
One should not confuse an infection with an epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi says. MRSA will be found everywhere anyone bothers to test for it, he adds. 
Antibiotic resistance 
"We isolate patients with MRSA and nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks when working with infected patients. We also have the appropriate antibiotics needed to treat them," says Nyulasi. 
When a patient is admitted to the hospital, one of the first things done is to check for the presence of MRSA, but hospitals are still vulnerable to infection. 
Testing for the staph isn't fashionable 
The vast majority of nosocomial MRSA-induced infections could be prevented said Böröcz. However, she added that current hospital conditions are not conducive to preventing the evolvement and spread of antibiotic-resistant infections. 
Since this type of infection typically occurs in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should routinely check all newly admitted patients and immediately isolate MRSA carriers. 
But, taking microbiological samples from patients is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals. 
One reason is that the National Health Insurance Fund does not cover the costs of these tests. 
In most cases the bacteria remain unnoticed unless the patient has an obvious MRSA infection, said the National Centre for Epidemiology physician-in-chief. 
The European Union has stringent protocols on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and Hungary has its own guidelines on treating various infections and pathologies. 
The goal should be targeted therapy, meaning that microbiology tests should be conducted to prevent resistance from evolving, but hospitals do not always keep to this. 
It is even rarer to take a microbiology sample among outpatients in primary or specialized care, Böröcz added. 
Saving money by cutting back on disinfectants 
Scientific evidence shows that the most common way MRSA is transferred from one patient to another through healthcare personnel who carry it from patient to patient. 
Therefore, washing hands, and wearing gloves and masks play a significant role in prevention, but here again, we find many shortcomings in hospital practices. 
MRSAs are transmitted through physical contact and body fluids. Under domestic hospital conditions, an infected patient cannot always be isolated. 
In fact, hospital wards are often overcrowded, with beds too close to one another although they should be at least 1.5 metres apart to conform to epidemiological requirements. 
Sadly, we also find that when hospitals are short on funds they tend to save on disinfectants, said Böröcz, adding that with a shortage of nursing staff and too many patients, chances of infection increase. 
According to Böröcz, there are demonstrably fewer infections, and those that occur are easier to prevent from spreading, in hospitals that take appropriate protective measures. 
Government programme to combat MRSA 
Treating MRSA infections costs the health insurer huge amounts of money, so efforts should be made everywhere to keep them from occurring in the first place. 
In the UK for example, the government has a programme in place to cut back MRSA and prevent its spread. 
The programme appears to be successful for published data shows that MRSA is on the decline in the UK. 
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has set prevention of the evolvement of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and of nosocomial infections as a priority project.
