Climatic propaganda 
Given that the movement against the climatic change, put under merciless persecution by the skeptics of its predictions like those that prioritize other political and social battles, is forced to show an iron determination. 
And as leader of the movement and as the president of the Government Zapatero thinks that this fight is more important that the one on Islamic terrorism and proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet". 
That approach forces him to explain why the action, or the inaction, of the Government has contributed decisively to the Spanish heading the UE breach of Kyoto. 
Who are the people responsible for the breach, in which sectors have they taken place and why his Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it. 
In addition, it demands to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spanish which are the measures that are needed to restrain the climatic change. 
Which companies will be affected, which citizen habits will have to be changed, which individual and collective power savings will we be forced to do, what economic consequences will it have. 
That is, who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet. 
But there has neither been nor will be explanations. 
Indeed because someone will have to sacrifice and pay. 
Measures against climatic change, the real measures, are unpopular. 
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals. 
Such as the hundreth of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE, which close to the election may be dangerous to Zapatero, who has hastened to deny it. 
That is, which one is to save the planet without doing anything, with pure propaganda, with slogans devoid of all real consequence. 
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions. 
With contracts with the planet, this man, who neither speaks nor complains nor demands, but adorns rallies and inspires tenderness, is very useful for election campaigns. 
Always, if the contract part is limited to being only virtual, and we only pretend to move around by bicycle or to stay fresh with a fan.
