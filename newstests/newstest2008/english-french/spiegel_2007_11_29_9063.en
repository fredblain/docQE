Venus Is Earths Hellish Twin 
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than anticipated: European space probe Venus Express discovered lightning in the atmosphere and whirlwinds at the poles, similar to those occurring on Earth in winter. 
For almost three decades, scientists suspected the existence of lightning on Venus. 
Now, the European probe Venus Express brings confirmation  it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: On Venus, lightning is leaping from cloud to cloud in a height of 56 kilometers, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the science magazine Nature. 
According to the famous primordial soup theory, life on Earth was conditioned by lightning: Supposedly, thunderstorms prompted reactions in the ocean which in turn led to the creation of amino acids, the building blocks of life. 
Not so on Venus: If life ever existed there, it had to have been in the planets very early history, explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution, Washington. 
Today, chances of life existing on the surface of Venus are slim: The atmosphere is about one hundred times denser than on Earth, with temperatures of up to 500 degrees. 
Venus may be a devilish twin of Earth, but a twin it is, Russel said. 
The key question of the ESA mission is why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in terms of mass and size, has undergone such a fundamentally different evolution. 
The launch of Venus Express in November 2005 marked a milestone for Venus research. There had been no probe specifically designed to explore the planet since the early nineties. 
The latest research results are now being presented in several Nature articles. According to the scientists, they do not just emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system. 
They also show that the similarities between our neighboring planet and Earth are greater than initially anticipated, ESA reports. 
In addition to the known whirlwind at the North Pole, for instance, the researchers discovered a whirl of clouds at the South Pole, spinning at a significantly higher velocity. 
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in Earths winter hemisphere, writes a research team of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica. 
The mass of the solar systems second-innermost planet is almost the same as that of Earth, as is its size, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers. 
The planet, which is also known as morning star or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days. 
Its rotation is much slower, however: One Venus day equals 243 Earth days. 
With surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, Venus barely resembles Earth. Nonetheless, scientists suspect that both planets developed under very similar conditions. 
Water accumulated on both planets. On Earth it remained in oceans, whereas on Venus it escaped into space. 
And while on Earth carbon dioxide is focused in carbonate rock, on Venus it makes up the bulk of the atmosphere.
