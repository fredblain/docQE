Von Beust Criticized on Olympics Withdrawal 
The mayors withdrawal of Hamburgs application for the Summer Olympic Games has spawned sharp criticisms from representatives of politics and trade. 
Many intend to keep fighting for the Waterfront Games. 
Von Beust calls for a realistic assessment of the odds, however. 
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Managing Director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described the withdrawal as being not good for the economic area. 
No other project had generated as significant a motivational force in the city recently as the notion of the Olympics, he said. 
Without that goal, the current sporting-politics momentum could not be maintained to this degree. 
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate not to bury the project, but to develop a new long-term approach that follows a different timeline. 
Mayor Ole von Beust insisted on earlier statements on Wednesday, saying that Hamburgs Olympic ambitions were unrealistic, at least before the year 2028. 
Its the German Olympic Sports Confederation that has to decide on an application for the Olympics, not Hamburg, Von Beust told Welt Online. 
He was referring to the Confederations decision on Munichs application for the Summer Olympic Games in 2018, which is expected in early December. 
What this preference means for us is that we wont have a realistic chance in the previously considered period prior to 2028. 
However, this did not mean that the dream was over for good, Von Beust said. 
The Sports Confederation Hamburg (HSB) regretted Von Beusts comments. 
They created the impression that Hamburg did not intend to apply for Olympic Games for the next 25 years, it was said. 
Its premature to spoil our odds by scrapping the plans at such an early stage, HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday. 
Further, withdrawing from the application was contradictory to statements made by the head of senate on the occasion of a reception at a plenary meeting of the German University Sports Confederation, Ploß added. 
There, Von Beust had insisted that Hamburgs application for the 2015 Universiade was no substitute for Olympic Games in Hamburg, he said. 
The University Sports Confederation had nominated Hamburg as a candidate for application as recently as last week. 
The Social Democratic Partys fraction at the Bürgerschaft, Hamburgs parliament, accused the senate of having wasted precious time by neglecting the construction of residences in Hamburg. 
The senate delayed the development of Kleiner Grasbrook for years, because it had put all its eggs in the Olympics basket and neglected housing construction, said Social Democratic delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast. 
Whereas the Social Democrats had always demanded an integrated concept for the Olympics with a view to a subsequent residential use, the Christian Democrats had been slanted towards the event factor, they said. 
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games had generated much excitement in Hamburg at the time. 
Hamburg was ultimately trumped by Leipzig, however.
