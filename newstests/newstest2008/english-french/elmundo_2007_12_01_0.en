The Celtic looking in Milan a point worth eighth 
Milan and Celtic are playing on Tuesday at San Siro in search of the point they needed to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the "Champions" league, as the Italians are used to be first and the Scots for his sentencing classification. 
The Italians added ten points and already certified in the fifth day pass with a tie in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that Benfica, which has four, do not overtake it. 
These two matches of Group D will be played in one week before the end of the sixth day, since Milan has to play in the Mundial de Clubes in Japan, where they make their debut on the 13 in the semi-finals in search of a place for the final on 16. 
So, this group will be closed before the rest and Giuseppe Meazza seems to expect a tie as the result, but the two teams will try to go for a win, and the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing into the quarter finals. 
To the Gordon Strachan team could serve even a defeat for classified Shakhtar if not wins, but may not be trusted because equality on nine points means that the Ukranians pass, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in another duel live. 
Thus, Milanists threaten to make it a bitter night for the Scots, who rely on getting into the quarters for the second time in a row in the restructured Champions League, after they were precisely defeated in this last round by a goal from Kaka in the extended time (1-0) after 0-0 in the round. 
Waiting for the victory of the "rossoneri" will be the Shakhtar to which only the win will do, in the event that Celtic lost both get into quarters to continue in the UEFA. 
And as to Benfica, despite being the last one and without any hope of staying in the top European competition, could reach third place with a victory, which play UEFA.
