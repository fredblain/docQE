Joy Division dominate film awards 
Control, the biopic about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has scooped five prizes at the British Independent Film Awards, including best film. 
Trophies were also given to star Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast as Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and co-star Toby Kebbell. 
Dame Judi Dench was named best actress for thriller Notes On A Scandal. 
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety award for putting British film under the international spotlight. 
The prizes were handed out in a ceremony at London's Roundhouse. 
Control follows Curtis's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980, aged 23. 
The black-and-white film - which features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order on the soundtrack - was shot for just Â£3m. 
But it earned Dutch photographer Corbijn, previously best-known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, two awards - for best director and best debut director. 
Rock music was the focus of another award-winner at the ceremony - as Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer took the Best Documentary prize. 
The best actor gong went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver to a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller Easter Promises. 
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, picked up the Richard Harris Award for outstanding contribution to British film. 
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull. 
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honour of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002. 
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney that opened the doors for people like me," he said. 
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a couple of times. 
He's my type of guy, a great actor of the time, I'm really honoured." 
The independent film awards, known as the Bifas, are selected by a panel which included filmmakers, actors and festival organisers. 
Bifa supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
