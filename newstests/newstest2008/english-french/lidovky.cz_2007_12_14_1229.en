Klaus: Environmentalists' Debates are Unbelievable 
Global climate changes will mostly harm developing countries. 
President VÃ¡clav Klaus has again commented on the problem of global warming. 
The concluding UNO international conference on climate changes in Bali faces his critique now. 
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he said that the environmentalists' debates were unbelievable. 
According to Mr. Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mixture of government officials and nongovernmental organizations which cannot be accepted, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric which accompanies it and the reality. 
"The debate there is absolutely unstructured, it is just a burst of words which are a substitute for the resolution of current problems," said Mr. Klaus. 
The Czech president emphasized during the presentation of his book that its topic is very important for him, which is why he is so engaged in it. 
He also expressed his satisfaction with the fact that his book is also available in German translation, because, as he said, "I frequently encounter only caricatures of my opinions". 
So now everybody interested can read his undistorted attitudes. 
Mr. Klaus mentioned that although he is no environmentalist, in his opinion he has enough qualifications to write such a book. 
That is, he is an academic, able to observe and evaluate technical discourse, he is experienced in statistics and he is also an economist. 
As the main conclusions of the book, he designated the theses that climates change constantly and their changes are thus normal, that there is no consistent opinion of all the researchers on global warming, that the effects of the current changes are not too great and relevant and so they do not represent any threat and that the efforts to influence the evolution of the climate are useless, inefficient and unacceptably costly. 
Moreover, as a man of experience with totalitarianism, he considers forcing unsubstantiated opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restraint of freedom, to be unacceptable. 
To the questions from the attendees he replied that he was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against the militant environmentalism which does not take into account the relation between costs and benefits". 
Mr. Klaus had talked on the same subject two months ago at the Hayek Institute in Vienna.
