The weight of the past 
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which explain the fate ot 17,5 millions victimes of Hitler dictatorship, can be consulted. 
The 47 millions documents gathered in the archives, arranged on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were until now exclusively available for «humanitarian» aims, therefore individually, by request of an ancient victim or by people entitled to. 
The eleven states charged with their administration -among them Germany, France, Israel and the United States- agreed on May 2006 in making them available for research workers and historians. 
Completed the ratification process of the agreement, the archives are available since yesterday. 
Sensitive information 
The historians access to Bad Arolsen archives will particularly enable « researches on the prisoners' movings, the camps' population and the health of the forced laborers », explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives kept by the International Council of Croix-Rouge (CICR). 
Up to now, many countries, among which Germany, opposed the public availability of these private documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information. 
Like the homosexuality or the mental handicap of some victims of the deportation. 
The registers of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered at the end of the war for a practical aim: finding the deported people or people subjected to forced labour and, eventually, demonstrate their internment, in order to let them getting their compensation. 
Nowadays, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees still receive tens of thousands individual requests. 
However, for some people of the scientific community, the access to Bad Arolsen has a limited interest. 
« There is nothing new to learn from these documents », declared in 2006 the Pr Wolfgang Benz, director of the research centre on anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität of Berlin.
