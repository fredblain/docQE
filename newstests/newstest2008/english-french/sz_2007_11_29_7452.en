Musharraf Begins First Civilian Reign 
One day after resigning as army chief, Pakistani ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president. 
Thus, eight years of military rule in Pakistan came to an end. 
On Thursday, President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term in office. 
The ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad was broadcast live on Pakistani television. 
Musharraf vowed to honor the constitution and to act towards the good of the nation. 
On Wednesday, he had consigned the office of army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, yielding to international pressure, by the US in particular. 
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now for the first time reigns as a civilian head of state. 
By stepping down as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had complied with one of the key demands of the opposition and of the West. 
Ending the state of emergency, which Musharraf had declared on November 3, is another central demand. 
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will revoke the state of emergency soon after being sworn in, and by doing so meet another of the demands of the West. 
Last week, the countrys supreme court had overruled all objections to the head of states controversial re-election on October 6. After declaring a state of emergency, Musharraf had filled it with jurisprudents who were well-disposed towards him. 
In the northern Tribal Area of North Waziristan, four soldiers were killed and four more harmed in an attack on a military convoy, meanwhile. 
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghanistan border.
