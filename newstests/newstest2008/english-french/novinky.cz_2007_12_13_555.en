Cuba the Most Beautiful Island of the Caribbean 
For its visitors it is really an island of freedom. 
Whatever you expect from your vacations, it can happen if you make the right choice. 
Golden and lily-white beaches, high waves or a sea calm as a pond. 
Palm trees and the full board with waiters offering pizza, ice-cream or potent shakes on the beach. 
Kite-surfing, golf and roulette. 
You will find a full and even richer list of all this on the islands in the Caribbean Sea. 
But there is just one island where you find much more, and that island is Cuba, the biggest and most beautiful of the West Indies. 
Under the reign of Spaniards, Cuba was the stronghold of their American conquest. 
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a man's eye had ever seen. 
Havana became a storage and transfer center for the treasures the Spaniards had stolen in America and transferred to Europe. 
And then the American era came. 
The Hotel Nacional was built at the very end of the 1920s. 
Its building was initiated by one of the bosses of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because all that was illegal in the U.S. (especially during the prohibition) was welcome and supported in Cuba, drugs, gambling, prostitution. 
Among his guests were, among others, 
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra. 
High-rises were built in Havana, and the cars which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s drove on the wide avenues. 
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and he had a yacht in Cojímar. 
The movie stars and politicians from all over America were leaving their signatures on the walls of Bodeguita del Medio. 
What about today? 
Even you can leave your autograph on the walls in the Havana Bodeguita. 
They will mix a shake according to your wishes in the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional. 
And the cult cars from the 1950s have been driving around Havana ever since, because the once imported Zhiguli and Fiat vehicles have decayed in the salty and damp weather. 
Though Havana, particularly its oldest part, is significantly squalid, nowhere else in the surroundings is there such a great number of fabulous colonial sights. 
Other places have also been transformed into beauty, e.g. Trinidad. 
With respect to the fact that tourism brings in badly needed money, its development has the green light. 
In the last 15 years, new hotels were built not only in Havana, but in particular in Varadero, on the Holguín coast and on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others. 
Cuba offers one more rarity which is unique in the world, of special value to train lovers. 
Sugar cane from the vast plantations was transported to the sugar mills on narrow rails by a small steam locomotive and motor trains. 
Their wagon stock has not been renewed for dozens of years and so you can see functional trains there whose contemporaries elsewhere are now only in museums. 
Where to go? 
Most visitors to Cuba will not miss the best known spots. 
And so there is no need to get into much detail about Varadero or Havana. 
Perhaps just to mention that there is a museum in the Hemingway homestead mentioned above and those who like this author should not miss the visit. 
The Viňales Valley The Viňales Valley in the western part of the island is one of the most picturesque spots in Cuba. 
Lush vegetation grows out of the limestone bedrock. 
Mogotes, limestone round-topped mountains and rocks rise up steeply from the bottom of the valley and fertile soil has taken hold in the cavities, thanks to which even the dilapidated rocks are covered with thick overgrowth. 
The valley is a place where probably the extra-best Cuban tobacco is grown. 
You can encounter its final shape if you visit one of the Havana factories for cigar making. 
The fact that the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed there may also be of interest to some. 
Trinidad 
An ancient city which was established shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island. 
Fame and fortune were brought there with the slave and sugar trades. 
Fortune transformed into beauty and the imposing architecture of the small city. 
The colonial Spanish architecture, deeply influenced by the later French colonists, has not changed much during four centuries. 
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is a place so remote that even as late as in the 1950s there was still no road to connect the area to the rest of the country. 
The isolation helped it remain apart from it. 
Nothing was being built there, therefore nothing was being torn down either, everybody was glad to have a roof over their head. 
If you have more time for Trinidad than just one afternoon, other interesting places in the neighborhood are worth seeing as well, like the Playa Ancón beach or the Sugarmill Valley. 
In the evening, it is appropriate go to Casa de la Música, which becomes full of life at nightfall and the music abates there at dawn. 
Baracoa 
A tiny town easternmost end of Cuba is described by some as the most beautiful one on the island. 
This opinion is certainly influenced by the road leading there itself. 
Both roads leading there from Guantanámo must pass through high and rugged mountains and they go through natural surroundings nearly untouched by human activity. 
Thanks to its unviolated nature, the eastern cape of Cuba has been placed by UNESCO onto the World Heritage List. 
They make the best chocolate there, they have a Columbus cross in a church (which was actually created about one hundred years after Columbus's voyage) and from the hill where the former castle and what today is the hotel El Castillo stands, you can see several mesas, of which El Yunque is the most famous. 
You can fill many pages writing about it all: the coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santería, and African religions, which are professed by the descendants of former slaves. 
But, as the veritable saying goes, better to see it once.
