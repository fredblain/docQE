Integration of Slovak Pupils in British Schools Not Progressing 
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is rising, making the local residents fear further development of the local education system. 
The integration of Eastern Europeans is encountering a number of impediments at present. 
British schools register even cases when quarrels between the immigrants and the children of the original population turn into violence. 
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is exemplified well by the situation in northern Kent, where quarrels between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate. 
Arguments, bullying and fights between the pupils have extended to the relations between their parents. 
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who beat a ten-year-old pupil with an iron cane. 
In her own defense, the offender claims that the boy had insulted her with racial slurs. 
The police also had to intervene following an attack by two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant. 
The girls reportedly called the man racist comments and threw stones at him. 
"When we were on our way home, a boy climbed onto the bus stop and started to spit down onto us. 
When I asked him to stop it, he pelted us with apples and pears and than he showed up his nude bottom," a mother of Slovak pupils described another unpleasant accident for The Times. 
The complaints come from both sides. 
One of the local residents even classified the quarrels with Eastern European immigrants as a fight for survival. 
The above mentioned cases indicate that the mood between the locals and the immigrants at British schools is beginning to be strained. 
There are 70 thousand Slovaks registered in Britain who moved there for work. 
Roughly 30 thousand Slovak pupils, then, attend British schools.
