Court Reduces Sentences for Detectives Affiliated with Berdych 
Ex-police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal conspiracy with the David Berdych gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years, respectively. 
It was decided definitively by the High Court in Prague, which thus reduced their sentences by one and two years, respectively. 
The original sentence facing the detectives of the Prague Organized Crime Subdivision was 14 and 12 years, respectively. 
It is not possible to appeal today's decision, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible. 
Though Berdych is charged in this case as well, he is still waiting for the verdict in the first instance. 
Nevertheless, he has already been given sentences in other trials totaling more than 16 years. 
He cannot get any more. 
In January, the regional court found 19 people guilty, above all of the participation in felonies, the High Court was dissolving the appeals of 16 of them today. 
Most of those charged refuted the indictment from the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it is a fabricated case. 
According to the Central Bohemian Regional Senate, the members of the police, after making an arrangement with Berdych, gave the information from the police sources to the criminals, covered up the individual felonies and helped the members of the gang to elude their sentences. 
In exchange, the gang surrendered 30 percent of the loot to Opava and Koňařík. 
The indictment deals with the crimes of the gang from 1999-2001. 
Namely, these were thefts whose victims often suffered serious physical injuries, but also the abuse of power and possession of illegal weapons. 
The police have discovered illegally held arms, steel bullets, a laser gunsight or an automatic rifle in house searches. 
According to the indictment, the gang made tens of millions of crowns in the thefts. 
Except for the nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have lawfully convicted Berdych and a number of other people of other thefts. 
Other men surrounding Berdych are still testifying in front of the court in a different trial, but some of the cases have not come to the trial yet. 
The trial has thus far avoided Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, currently in an Irish jail, where they await the decision regarding their version to the Czech Republic for prosecution.
