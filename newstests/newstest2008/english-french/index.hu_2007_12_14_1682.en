Police chief causing fatal accident was not drunk 
An official professional opinion has been submitted regarding a fatal accident caused by Budapest's District 22 police chief. 
Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Budapest Municipal Prosecutor's Office, issued a statement on Friday, on receipt of the professional opinion. The opinion unequivocally concludes that the District 22 police chief, who has resigned, could not have been under the influence of alcohol or any other substance when he hit and fatally injured a pedestrian on Tuesday. 
The professional opinion supported the result of the preliminary investigation which concluded that the former police chief had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel. 
The former District 22 police chief was driving his own car in his district. He turned around a corner and hit a 55 year-old man attempting to cross Kossuth Lajos Street at a spot where there was no marked pedestrian crossing. 
(The absence of an official crossing point is not a mitigating circumstance, since traffic rules mandate that pedestrians have the right of way over a turning vehicle,) 
The pedestrian died shortly after arrival at a hospital. 
The district police chief resigned because of the accident and requested that he be retired from the force because, said a police communique, he was so shaken by the event. 
The Budapest Prosecutor's investigative arm is conducting an inquiry. 
The former police chief has been cooperating fully with the prosecutors investigating the case, Morvai added.
