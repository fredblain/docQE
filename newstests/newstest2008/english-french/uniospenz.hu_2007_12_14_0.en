EnvironMin and Hungary's six percent 
Minister for the Environment, Gábor Fodor has said that professional level meetings on post-2012 international climate issues will end on Tuesday. The conference itself officially opens on Wednesday, when the ministers take up the matter. 
Professionals and politicians from 192 countries are slated to discuss the Bali Roadmap that focuses on efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions after 2012, when the Kyoto Protocol expires. 
At present the developing and developed nations are in the middle of a heated dispute. 
The United States has let it be known that it is unwilling to negotiate precise numbers although it is not opposed to agreeing to a 25-40 percent cut in greenhouse gases by 2020 when compared to 1990. 
The other big question at the conference is whether the developed nations are ready not only to reduce their emissions but also to offer financial and technological assistance to countries that need it. 
One agreement reached was on support to developing nations. 
A 16-member board will manage the funding for this, which is set by the Kyoto Protocol, and will most likely work within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), writes the local publication Piac és Profit. 
Hungary's six percent 
Representing Hungary. Environment Minister Gábor Fodor is ready to support EU endeavours to retain its flagship role in the global climate protection effort and promote a new international accord, to be reached by 2009. 
Fodor noted that the EU has its sights on a 20 percent drop in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990, whether the "post-2012 agreement" is reached or not, and is ready to cut them by 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the globe and developing nations are also ready to accept obligations to the extent of their abilities and responsibilities. 
Fodor said that back in 1997, the countries adhering to the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a 5.2 percent reduction in emissions overall. Within that group, the 15-member EU agreed to an 8 percent decline. 
Hungary agreed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-1987, a goal it intends to meet, said the environment ministry's press release. 
The stakes in Bali are high, for a long-term international agreement on climate policy needs to be under wraps within two years or it surely will not be able to go into effect by 2012.. Should that happen, the pledges made during the validity of the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed up immediately by another emissions-reduction regime, the need for which the UN's Nobel-Prize winning scientific body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC- has pointed out in its latest report. 
The result could be a delay in emissions reduction, which would put Earth on a certain course towards an average temperature rise exceeding 2 degrees Celsius. Should that happen, scientists say the consequences would be dire and irreversible.
