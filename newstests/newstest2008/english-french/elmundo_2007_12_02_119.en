Which insurance is good for me? 
The car insurance that covers the driver against possible claims, srepresents a major expense that would depend on various factors, such as age, sex, length of membership, marital status, the type of vehicle to insure or the usage of the latter, among others. 
Having the car is only the beginning. 
Because choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model. 
First we must be clear what we are talking about. 
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance agency and the insured. 
This commitment is translated into an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company will receive the agreed premium and in return it is responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of loss. 
The premium is the insurance price, which is established considering diverse factors, such as the age, sex, the length of membership, marital status, the type of vehicle to insure or the usage of the latter, among others. 
The insuring companies establish their prices based on the statistics, so that the greater the probability of having an accident is, the greater the premium is. 
It is for this reason that both drivers older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that they have a smaller accident index due to their prudence. 
Also, making use of the statisctics, companies have reached the conclusion that the married people tend to have less accidents than celibate drivers. 
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it in the probability of having some type of mishap. 
Increasing the frequency increases the probabilities. 
There are many variables that the insurers consider when establishing the price of the premium. 
It is for this reason, that the driver has to study his situation to choose the insurance that better adjusts his profile. 
Presented here are the most significant variables in choosing one or another kind of insurance that, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price. 
People younger than 25 years have diverse disadvantages at the time of contracting an insurance at a reasonable price, as the reduced driving experience and the length of the membership. 
Although, to be well insured, it is ideal to have a fully comprehensive insurance, other economic options exist. 
The most cautious drivers can decide for a franchise with any risk, so that they obtain the insurance coverage, but at a price more feasible. 
This class of agreement would suppose that the client cover a part of the costs in case of mishaps. 
"The amount of the costs that contributes the client will be settled based on the value of the premium, that will be higher if this amount is lowered", specifies Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, mediator of online insurances. 
Another option is an extended third party insurance, so that the client is assured protection from damages caused to third parties, although not to those caused to his own car. 
In addition, it would be covered for robbery, fire and the loss of the vehicle. 
An advice. 
If you are younger than 25 years try to be careful and avoid accidents as far as possible, since this will be an advantage, being able to reduce the cost of the insurance in the future. 
An advantage is a reduction on the basic tariff of the company. 
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on this base tariff. 
"Advantages and penalties will depend on the company and its benefits. 
If the company has had a good year it will be able to increase the advantages ", clarifies Noguera. 
Once over 25 years of age drivers have an easier time of contracting an insurance, since the accident index is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience. 
For this reason the most recommendable is to contract a fully comprehensive with tax exemption. 
"Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience previously acquired at the time of an accident, or even when driving", assures the director in Spain of the European company, to which adds that most of the accidents take place in the second year of driving, once the "fear of the novice" passes. 
Nevertheless, if the client is married but still doesn't have children it is better to negotiate an comprehensive insurance, as long as his economic situation allows it, clearly. 
On the other hand, people married with children are considered by the insurers as the public with accident rate, reason why the premiums will be smaller. 
In this case the best one is a fully comprehensive insurance with tax exemption (this being of 300 euros), or, when it is had, a high benefit level, a third-party extended as the third life's year of the vehicle. 
"They make a more relaxed driver and have a greater spending power to allow the luxury to assume an amount of greater tax exemption", states Luis Noguera. 
For the pensioners an fully comprehensive insurance with tax exemption (being this one of 150 euros), or a third party when a high level of advantage is had. 
It is necessary to say that the car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver over possible wrecks, but because it represents an important cost, reason for which it is fundamental to suitably study the insurance that agrees to us most according to our personal situation.
