Six little things you can annoy your colleagues with 
The e-mails we forget to send, the voice-mail messages we never get, the white lies we tell and no longer even notice - they can all colour day-to-day life on the job. 
The question is whether you get used to the minor annoyances or pick up the gauntlet and deliberately avoid dubious situations that can irritate others. 
A few tips. 
"Oops, sorry. I forgot to tell you that marketing was looking for you," says one of your colleagues. 
Oh, you missed a meeting because of that? 
In a best case scenario, he or she will apologize and try to mend things. He or she might even phone marketing to explain about the forgotten message (this scenario is quite rare). 
In most cases the matter ends with an apology. 
Before getting into a situation where you have to apologize, it is worth thinking about the things you might do to give your colleagues a few unpleasant minutes, and then deliberately try to avoid doing them. 
Do you borrow things that don't belong to you? 
Nothing is more annoying than reaching for a document, piece of office equipment or telephone which turns out not to be there. 
You remember having left your stapler on your desk but it appears to have grown wings overnight. 
Perhaps you see the pen you thought you lost lying on your colleague's desk. 
Don't take anything away from a colleague's desk without asking. They have every right to be angry if you make off with their belongings. 
Do not pocket office envelopes or Post-It notes. It can be very irritating if they run out prematurely, especially if you're the one who needs one immediately. 
Do you gossip about your colleagues' private lives? 
There is no good way to halt gossip that has already begun to spread. 
Who is doing what with whom? 
Where and why? 
There's no need to spread your information (assumptions) about your colleague all through the house! 
If someone shares his or her most intimate secrets with you, do not abuse that trust! 
Keep what you hear to yourself. When a colleague is out, do not discuss his or her private life with others, even if they also know what the person has been up to. 
Do you call in sick, when you're not? 
When you call in sick because of a splitting headache, or when you just don't feel good, or when you think it would be better to spend the day resting, think about the colleagues who will have to take up the slack and get all your urgent things done by deadline. 
Do not play dirty with your colleagues! 
If you know beforehand that you are not going to be in, or if something happens that forces you to stay home for a day, let your colleagues and supervisor know in advance. Don't surprise them by not showing up. 
Humming, hooting, phoning 
Have you ever been totally immersed in your work, only to lose your concentration because of guffawing colleagues? 
Have you ever been an unwilling earwitness to a phone conversation it would have been better not to have heard.? 
Do not disturb your colleagues by humming, singing, or loud talking (right over their heads), tapping rhythms with your feet, continuous cursing or loudly voiced complaints. 
All of these things can be irritating, even if people are not concentrating on a project (writing, planning or organizing something) at that very moment. 
Do you blame others for your mistakes? 
If something isn't ready by deadline, if you forgot to send out an important letter or pass on a message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness! 
Do not blame chaotic conditions in the office - even if they exist - or your noisy colleagues! 
Admit that you made the mistake and someone else suffered the consequences, and do what you can to make amends! 
Ask how you can repair the damage and do what it takes to make things right! 
Is the office too much like a second home? 
Track suit and slippers: quite comfortable when you're at home, but they are not office wear! 
Do not dress for leisure at the office, even if your job allows it! 
Do not be sloppy. Show respect for your colleagues and yourself by dressing tastefully - and elegantly if your job requires it - to go to work.
