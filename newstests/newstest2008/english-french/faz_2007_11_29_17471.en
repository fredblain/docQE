Renegade Soldiers Surrender in Manila 
In the Phillipines, renegade soldiers surrendered after seizing a hotel in Manila and demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. 
At the hotel, leader Anthonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters that he did not want to cause bloodshed. 
Earlier, government troops had stormed the hotel using tear gas. 
The approximately two dozen soldiers had occupied the hotel for hours. 
On Thursday, around half of them had faced a court of law for a failed coup in 2003, including Trillanes. 
The latter then seized the trial to make a sudden escape along with 30 sympathizers. 
The military police charged with guarding him had apparently defected and joined his mutiny. 
They seized the Peninsula Hotel, demanding President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to be overthrown. 
Troops loyal to the government cordoned off the area surrounding the posh hotel. 
The president called for an emergency meeting of the National Security cabinet. 
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers actions. 
People have had it, Trillanes said. 
We are calling on people to join us. 
Other military units were to join the march shortly, said General Danilo Lim, former leader of the Scout Rangers elite unit. 
Regime critics had called for mass demonstrations against the president. 
Her government has been facing allegations of corruptions for months. 
Manilas financial district had already been the focus of an attempted mutiny against Arroyo once before, by approximately 200 members of the military back in 2003. 
After nearly 24 hours, the insurgence failed when the armed forces refused to join it. 
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Phillipines.
