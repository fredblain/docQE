The army has enough igniter cord to wind the whole of Czech Republic. But they will expire in only two years.
Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of cords, which detonate explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence delivered 224 km of the cords lines into the warehouses.
The army thus has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that life of the lines is two to four years.
The Army purchased the detonating cords from STV Group, Inc. for CZK 40 million.
The General Staff provided the reasoning for buying such a huge quantity of igniter cords to MF Dnes stating that soldiers use 60 km of igniter cords in training per year.
Calculations of army bomb disposal experts that the MF Dnes approached imply that it would be a very intense pyrotechnic training that would be undergone also by all the generals every year, along with the officers of the army, secretaries and cleaners.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and army commander Vlastimil Pick included.
Only thus could be the army annual consumption of sixty kilometers of igniter cords justified.
This period corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army reserves would be enough for more than ten years.
However, if the basic training of any new professional actually needed just two meters of the igniter cord, as the experts say, then the army has ensured by the purchase - even with increased consumption by engineer or special units - the stock for the above 225 years.
Rapid Deployment Brigade soldiers personally complained recently to the minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for small arms and so shootings are limited due to shortage of money.
Not mentioning the lack of underwear.
"I do not understand either, that they buy so many igniter cords from us repeatedly."
"But it's their decision, and they certainly know what they will use them for."
"For us, the army is a good customer, whose demands we try to meet as retailers," says the sales manager of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejsek reasons for the purchased hundreds of kilometers of cords by creation reserves of such "munitions" for ten years at least.
Jan Děcký of STV Group, however, speaks only of the four-year life of the cords and police or army deminers even of mere two years.
"If stored under perfect conditions, it can be even four," said one, who as a soldier does not want to disclose the name when criticizing the military.
After expiry date any ammunition must be carefully tested for reliability to make sure it does not endanger the life of soldiers.
These tests are not free and it cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry is the quantity discount on 445 km of the ignition cords.
"It cost us about sixty percent less than last year's supply of two hundred forty-four kilometers," says the speaker Pejsek the opinion of buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Just for comparison: Annual consumption of firing lines of police deminers who destroy munitions from World War II and the one left after the Soviet army has not exceeded 1500 meters for several years.
A police orders only such amount of the ammunition that would be used before its expiration.
It paid back for the safety of deminers and the flexibility to acquire more modern and thus more reliable types of lines.
Ministry of Defence has already considerable problems with the liquidation of tens of thousand tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Pact, when the two-hundred-thousand Czechoslovak army was preparing to set off for the Rhine.
The Czech one, according to the pyrotechnicians approached by MF Dnes, will face the same problem in a few years: They will dispose of hundreds of kilometers of old igniter cords that are currently "cheaply" purchased.
