Euro: BCE compelled to buy State securities
The last annual meeting of the board of governors of the European Central Bank (BCE) had to be the occasion of specifying the methods of emerging from the crisis, or at least of announcing the end of a good number of unconventional monetary policy operations, which have to be completed by the year end.
The European sovereign debt crisis obliges the issuing institute in Frankfurt to bahave less peremptorily, on pain of aggravating the situation, which is now more than tense enough already on European markets of obligation.
The political cost would be all the higher.
Yesterday at a Press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde greeted the active role played by the BCE to resolve the debt crisis of European States.
She did not wish to say whether she thought that the Central Bank had to do more, for example, by increasing its programme of buying sovereign bonds.
She said that she would communicate her thoughts to her European partners.
In Brussels on the day before during his hearing before the economic and monetary affairs commission of the European parliament, the chairman of the BCE, Jean-Claude Trichet did not prove more diffuse about his intentions, contenting himself with saying that the programme of buying State securities in the secondary market would continue and that they would see what will be decided at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty: The BCE would keep its principal rate of interest unchanged at 1%, historically the lowest since May 2009.
Factually, the obligatory Treasury purchases by the BCE doubled during last week to almost 1.35 thousand million Euros.
And, according to indiscretions of market operators, it made fresh purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
In total, Eurosystem central banks bought 67 thousand millions' worth of Euros since May 2010.
There is no doubt among market operators about the expectations of a pursuit of purchases (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect any marked change of cap.
Whilst loan operations at over three months have already disappeared from the BCE Bank arsenal, the latter continues to grant unlimited cash loans on generous terms and for periods from one weke to three months.
Economists now expect that the facility will be extended by some months.
Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank cannot imagine that it will modify it programe to any great extent.
He says that this would cause new short-term tensions.
Norbest Bräms, an economist at Sal says that a gradual exit to be announced during the firts quarter of 2011 appears more likely.
Oppenheim.
Norbet Bräms adds that on the level of its interventions in the public debt market, the BCE would have to make purchases of these bonds adequately large to revive the lacklustre market.
Taking into account the large exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets of the Euro zone, the issuing institute has no option other than to maintain a presence in the market.
An important bonds manager said yesterday that the Bank must at all costs offsat the shortage of investors in the market and prevent a boom of payments by the most vulnerable States.
Because if interest rates take off, States will be all the more anxious to reduce their indebtedness, or to stabilise it.
This is the price of safeguarding the Euro.
