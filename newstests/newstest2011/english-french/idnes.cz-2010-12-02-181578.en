House of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interiors by Gaudi
The roof looks like a prehistoric lizard's spine, the staircase reminds of a dinosaur backbone and balconies are open fish mouths.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
The locals started to call it the House of bones for its organic shapes.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, facade reminiscent of scales and soft curves everywhere, all of which are typical of Art Nouveau by Antoni Gaudí.
The facade of the house opens dreamy lines, soft colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
The detailed look reveals geometry, rhythm, and well-considered order.
At night, the entire facade of the house seems even more dramatical, it is lit so that the gloss paint impression would be further enhanced.
Winding and twisting shapes appear equally as much indoors.
Wood follows in the window frames in the waves, along with handrails, door trim, moldings and watch.
Batlló House, located in the Eixample district on a busy shopping street Passeig de Gracia No. 43, was rebuilt from the original house in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sal Cortes.
Reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, a wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on the demolition of the old building and construction of an entirely new one, but soon he adopted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper redevelopment of the house.
Apartment building Casa Batlló was nevertheless not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol cooperated with him.
It was his developer's board where the decorations for the representative apartment of the property owner were created, as well as the use of a mosaic on the facade.
A number of other authors and artists worked on the facade.
Joint work on drafts for Casa Batlló building started a successful cooperation of Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol took part in the construction of Gaudi's building Casa Mila and Park Guell, which contains other Gaudi's works.
The locals started to call it the "House of bones" for its organic shapes soon after its completion.
Others began to call it a "yawning house" for its specific mechanism of windows opening.
It is also said that on top of the building there is a representation of the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the building also contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi designed a central heating system in the house, unique for his time, with ventilation and typical chimneys.
Their forty-five degree slope may seem bizarre.
When creating Gaudi totally disregarded building regulations of the time and did not let them tied him up.
At the start of construction he actually received a building permit from the city, but the provided details about the planned reconstruction were so vague, that two years after the completion the City Council was horrified by the result and asked for redress.
Councilors did mind for example that the building interfered with its pillars into the public sidewalk.
The correction never happened, rather the opposite: only fifteen days after the request from the city, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully received) the permission to lease the top two floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to lower floors.
There was a banquet hall in the gallery on the second floor and on the third floor there was a bedroom and a private section of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry.
The entire six-storied building is intersected by a staircase, which ends only at the roof terrace.
The key elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and replacing them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space interconnection.
The social part is completely connected by opening the saloon door and a larger group can comfortably communicate without losing the necessary privacy for intimate conversations.
The house won due to Gaudi's rebuilding a new facade and also the unusual roof and two extra floors.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, along with blue and white glazed tiles used to line the inner courtyard and skylights.
The play of two colors delivers a maximum of light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to gamble on the principle that white reflects light more than dark colors, which absorb the sun's rays on the contrary.
Casa Batlló House, which was included in UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
The most spacious and most luxurious apartment has been opened to the public on the first floor.
The owners decided to move this up in 2002 to celebrate the one hundred fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the famous author.
They kept providing the excursions since they discovered that this is a very profitable business, plus they extended tours by the common and attic spaces, including a roof terrace.
Admission to the sight is certainly not negligible, amounts to 16.50 euros, while students, seniors, groups and travel passes holders receive a twenty percent discount.
The amount greatly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudi's buildings in the city.
If you want to experience the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you have to quickly make friends with any of the inhabitants of the apartment house and visit them at home.
