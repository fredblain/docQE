Survey that removes absurd regulations
Poll of the Absurdities is a part of the business competition for the fourth time.
Some ridiculous regulations have are already been removed.
Infamous winner of next year's Poll of Absurdities was the absurd obligation to bring documents that are accessible for officials online to the authorities.
It was chosen by more than a third of almost four thousand votes.
For example, Social Security Administration required a paper certificate of incorporation, although the officer can obtain one by two clicks of a mouse.
Thanks to the poll, this will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will not require the certificate of incorporation from for controls of contributors," said spokesman Jana Buráňová of CSSA.
To crack down on all the rules and regulations that companies and businesses in the Czech Republic must meet, and remove those that lack sense, is the essence of the Poll of Absurdities.
This is the fourth time this year, it has been a part of the business competition, held by Hospodářské noviny and it is becoming increasingly popular among the public.
If about three thousand voters were involved in the vote last year, there were nearly four thousand voters earlier this year.
And not surprisingly, there are still many legal obligations, which only serve to delay the business.
"For instance in the number of papers required for tax returns we keep the top places in the world," said Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Crafts in CR.
Simplification of business has in recent years become a stated objective of all governments.
But compared with the rest of the world the situation has not really improved in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, in terms of business conditions the Czech Republic was ranked 74th position; it is eight points less than last year.
The Poll of Absurdities was first launched in 2006 and takes place every year under the same scenario.
Anyone may propose administrative and bureaucratic nonsenses every year from April to September, when is there is the deadline for the competition.
In order to sign for the competition, website HYPERLINK "http://www.firmaroku.cz" is to be used. Organizer then chooses the seven candidates for the "anti-award" and allows the public vote for it in October at the website www.firmaroku.cz /absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets most votes wins.
In this survey more than a hundred, 105 to be precise, meaningless rules and regulations were filed.
Tips were received from entrepreneurs, but also professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest was for instance the requirement that the trucks for maintenance of highways were to pay road-tolls, or that businesses with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets had those painted every two years.
The list of this year's seven proposals is posted on the website of the contest.
Announcement of the competition, which always takes place in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague is part of the hapenning, regularly attended by personalities of the political and social life.
This year, for example, the finale of the competition was assisted by Eva Svobodova, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Crafts in CR and Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce in CR.
"Economic prosperity can not work where the state is throwing business in its own foot, so my goal is to annually remove at least three dozen paragraphs, which today only unnecessarily complicate the business," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to abolish meaningless regulations has rather positive load.
In 2007 most people were against the obligation of a business to report their intention to take part at the exhibition or fair with their stand three days ahead to the trade office at the place where its permanent establishment is located.
This has been removed by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was reporting a business trip of foreign staff lasting up to 30 days to the Labour Office, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And last but not least.
Absurdity of 2009 was the obligation of physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two stepping scales in the office.
It was mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
