It is urgent that the tourist sites are taken care of
The tourist industrialists feel sorry for the accident of the foreign tourist caused by bad conditions of the Glorieta Sanchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the down-fall of Glorieta Sanchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to the zones and sites that are in a bad state and that offer a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Retailers of the Zone Dorada, remembered that in different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destiny should be taken care of and to change the bad perceptions that the tourists might find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad conditions of the streets and the side-walks have affected because the tourists come to take a walk and see the disorder and they avoid the complementary businesses.
The politicians do not know what it means to close for one day and do not have any idea about the amount of money that is lost, or otherwise they wouldn't do the jobs this way in such a long period of time and without previous planning.
The hotelkeeper Jose Ramon Manguart Sanchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance from the part of the City council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and to avoid this happening again, by giving preventive maintenance and not doing only the correction," he said.
We look forward to enjoying a clean city, because not only must the area be given the maintenance, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean site to live on; the City council must change its strategy in order to maintain good living and visiting conditions.
There are other sites that are also neglected and incomplete, he said, as for example El Escudo and the Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Nowadays, for the tourist to come does depend only by the promotion, we must have a good product, a city that has clean beaches and avenues, permanent maintenance of the attraction areas," he said.
"There wasn't enough attention paid and this underlines something that is well-known by all, that maintenance is a must."
Raul Llera Martinez, secretary assistant of Tourist Promotion, expressed that the rescue of tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not enjoyed of a correct manner and they project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that has to align altogether with the municipality and to be a priority having the city always, clean, ordinate and attractive because it is a touristic city.
Luckily Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be put in order first of all, cleaned and made attractive in order to be able to add them in the inventory when promoting the city.
