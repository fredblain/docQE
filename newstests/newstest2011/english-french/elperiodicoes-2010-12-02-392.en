Hunting of the head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a person in charge of the antiterrorism fight in order to avoid new filtrations.
Interpol emits a red alert with the purpose of following the movements and locating Assange where he might is.
All that is related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which it is difficult to have certainty on any of the facts.
Yesterday Interpol emitted one "red alert" in order "to locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
Nevertheless, this isn't a traditional order of arrest.
In addition, it isn't new, because it dates from the 20th of November.
And has nothing to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents pertaining to the USA but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police knows where and how to get into contact with Mr. Assange."
It was day 20 when the international police body with headquarters in Lyons (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Given the facts, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications for identifying or locating to Assange "with respect to his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although the Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the Member States, as the organization explained, consider the call network notice free way for making an arrest --that has to undertake the national body of police, - especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange might be.
The movement irritated the lawyers of Assange, who published yesterday a letter denouncing that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years old, declared being willing to take part in a video conference in order to answer any questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange asked and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the public prosecutor in his case, whom they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security of Stalin.
"This seems to be hunting, not a legal persecution," denounces the letter.
While the world was searching for him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son-- Assange follows in unknown whereabouts, but not in silence.
On Monday gave from an unknown place an interview to the director of the magazine Time through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton.
"If it is possible to show that she was responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy in the ONU violating international treaties that the USA has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described as "ridiculous and absurd" the resignation request.
"I don't know why we should pay any attention to the opinion of a man with a web page" declared the CNN.
Obama himself has ordered to a high person in charge with the antiterrorism fight, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document leaks.
The attempt by the spokesman of President Barack Obama to reduce the attention paid to Assange contrasts with opinions that politicians and commentators now proclaim.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will preside over the Committee of National Security in the House of Representatives, has asked the Department of State to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "in order to take part and his funds and to persecute anyone who give them any contribution or help."
Furthermore went Tom Flanagan, an adviser of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, who had to withdraw his opinion after saying that Assange would have to be murdered."
"Obama should turn him into an objective and use a non manned aircraft or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, ex-governor of Arkansas and possible candidate to the presidency.
"Whoever he is in the Government the one who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not the execution would be a too much gentle punishment," declared for Fox.
