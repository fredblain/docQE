Red Bull triumphs in F1 with its secret weapon: Siemens.
There is software that can design improvements to the cars in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
Initially nobody considered the options of a team that just arrived, in spite of the ascending trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final race of the championship all bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without losing part of his reputation as champion driver, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the power of the Renault motor that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 " the secret weapon that the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull in order to turn it into a winning team has become a legend.
In fact it is powerful simulation software that the German company marketed in 2007 with aims very far away from the high automobile competition.
Denominated PLM, this powerful computer science instrument has been used to design assembly chains for manufacturing factories, energy plants, instruments of high precision.
The objective is to reproduce, to faithfully simulate the product or the process before constructing it in a real mode, avoiding this way failures and avoidable expenses.
Plm has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the airplanes of Sukhoi or the most famous utilitarian cars of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, person in charge of the Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this computer science instrument in his F1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and make "in a few hours, almost in time real," the modifications, changes and improvements that are needed during the races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the team in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during every season.
Red Bull has 180 professional young people with high qualifications working today who, equipped with powerful computer science equipment, analyse and project all kind of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the software PLM is able to analyse and improve all elements of Red Bull cars except for the engine, which is the entirely the responsibility of Renault.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and elements of security are being modified.
The changes can be taken from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in 24 hours, thanks to advanced production systems by means of laser and autoclaves of high tech.
The only limitation of this spark of technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each team of Formula 1 can spend at the most every season in order to facilitate the competition.
Red Bull has build a high-tech factory for designing and producing its cars in a locality about 50 KM from London.
There are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that occurs there is considered "Top Secret."
The factory has 580 employees, including its two drivers, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull hero, without any doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energetic drink brand has put to the service of its participation in the circuits, other protagonists hide whose contribution is inestimable and their notoriety unrecognised.
The head of technology at the factory, Steve Nevey, affirms that five years ago it was possible to affirm that the advances of I+D in the cars contributed to 50% to the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds 85% of the success, while the drivers contribute with 15% to the added value.
Nevey recognizes that neither Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science since "they are indispensable gladiators."
