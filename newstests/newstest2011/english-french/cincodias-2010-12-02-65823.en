The president of Eulen will contest the meeting of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm does not moderate the Alvarez family conflict, proprietors of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, will oppose, by considering "null and void," the judicial meeting of En Enebro of the 16th, required by five of his seven children and when they try to impose their majority and take control of the management organs of the company that owns the Vaga Sicilia warehouses.
David Alvarez and his children Jesus David and Maria Jose are taking into consideration the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for the control of part of the group.
The founder of the greatest holding company of enterprise services does not seem willing to give up in his litigation in order to be present in the control systems of El Enebro.
From his council of administration he was taken off by five of his seven children who appointed themselves administrators in the council of shareholders on 18th of January of this year and whose opposition is written down in the Mercantile Registry.
The judicial meeting of El Enebro arranged for the 16th, summoned by the magistrate of Mercantile Affairs Number 2 of Madrid, has caused havoc yet again in the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge for determining the assembly is, until the conflict is solved, the single legal mechanism that guarantees the meeting's convention.
The last actions of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Alvarez as a "desperate appeal by the representatives of his five children who, by means of procedural subtlety, clearly infringing the Law and abusing the right, try to confirm and change the meeting of the 18th of January as null," according to his official spokesmen.
This argumentation will be the basis on which to establish that: once the meeting has been held, he will reject considering it "null and void."
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried without success to have the magistrate summon a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, patrimonial society holder of the Warehouses Vega Sicilia, among others assets, the seven children of David Alvarez control the 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims, nevertheless, the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This subject is the basic aspect that has to be decided by the judge once celebrated the meeting on the demand of opposition, for which the date is no indicated yet.
