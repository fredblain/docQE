Second mandate: the evidence
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterand made others believe that he hesitated.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sakozy still fewer than they.
An Elysée mandate tells a different story.
Accordingly, the current head of State will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence conflicts with the mystique of the presidential function.
It is now necessary to pretend that the doubt had always existed.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, friends of Jacques Chirac pretended that a third mandate was not excluded.
On 15 November with a grave air, Nicolas Sarkozy gave an assurance that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011"
The fact that on Tuesday night at the Elysée before UMP deputies he called up the prospect of "two mandates" sowed some feverish reflections.
Was this the official annoucement of his candidature?
Far from it.
The president only recalled that the 2008 revised constiution limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He stated facts, but he did not make an announcement.
This is not for the first time that he humorously mentions the presidential election at such meetings.
He said in July 2009 that at best they only had another seven and a half years of him.
Rebelote in May 2010: Do not believe that I only thought about it afterwards
His intentions of the day before yesterday did not make him any more or any less a candidate than those of the day before that.
If they occasion comments, the reason is twofold.
On the one hand, the acceleration of the progress of the candidature of the socialist party.
But it is not the entry into the lists of Segolene Royal, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to unmask himself.
The reason is, on the contrary, that his 2012 candidature is clearly what many members of the socialist party are calling for, an earlier plan of battle than one originally planned.
The bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, voters on the right preferred the candidature of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (45% against 44%, according to EVA-L'Express).
The entourage of the Prime Minister immediately said that it had a candidate and that there was no debate about this within UMP.
Jean-Pierre Raffarin said that if he, the candidate, believed that defeat was a possibility, he would not be a candidate.
Alain Juppé said in the face of evidence and by way of correction that the candidate would always believe that he could win.
