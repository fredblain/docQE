Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country is refusing to comment - but is allowing inspections.
Towards midnight on the night of 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates river; the next major city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair Alzour.
The name turns up in IAEA documents when there is mention of the reactor Syria is alleged to have built in the cube-shaped building hidden in a valley cut off from the country's electricity network - with aid from North Korea.
According to a briefing from the US foreign intelligence service, the CIA, at the end of April 2008, the reactor, commonly referred to by the name of the nearest settlement El Kibar, could be used to produce plutonium - which could in turn be used to build atomic bombs.
The technology from the fifties is of very little use for any other purpose.
The CIA gave a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
Using computer animation, the agency showed where the components of the reactor are believed to have been located before its destruction - the reactor is said to be a smaller copy of the north Korean model from the atomic centre in Yongbyon.
They agency also produced photos showing the building close up, and even its interior.
The reactor is believed to have been almost ready for commissioning, but not yet supplied with fuel rods.
Now, more than three years after the bombardment, almost no more is known. In fact, the questions seem to have increased with time.
The former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that, although the CIA had known before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in El Kibar, it had not discovered any signs that there was "an active nuclear weapons programme" in the country.
Many intelligence officials in Europe are even more sceptical and speak only of an "alleged reactor," even if they believe the CIA presentation was "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how certain he is that a reactor exists this summer, a high-ranking UN diplomat replied laconically that the IAEA had "enough material to pose questions."
The Syrians, in any case, rapidly removed the rubble of the supposedly "unused military building" and levelled the area completely.
Nonetheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by chief inspector Olli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in El Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA obtained commercially produced satellite images from a Member State from the period immediately preceding the attack - images said to be more convincing that the images presented by the CIA.
However, the images were not available on the market, as the unknown customer - Israel, perhaps - has purchased them exclusively.
Hence, the IAEA cannot independently verify their authenticity.
Syria has claimed never to have had a secret atomic programme or to have built a reactor.
Damascus claims the uranium was from Israeli weapons.
However, after analysing the particles, the IAEA rejected the claim as implausible.
Since then, Damascus has avoided discussion on this point - or on the satellite images.
Syria has also prevented inspectors carrying out a second inspection in El Kibar or to access the rubble of the bombed building.
Israel is also maintaining a stony silence.
"We will never comment on this," said the former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, in office at the time of the attack, confirming the official position.
So the investigation has continued since June 2008 without conclusion and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority," according to a high-ranking western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - ultimately, a serious infringement of the non-proliferation treaty remains unresolved in the hands of the IAEA.
The IAEA clearly believes the key to moving forward in this process lies in three additional facilities that are supposed to have had a "functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and in contrast to the reactor, still exist.
However, inspectors have not so far disclosed the nature of the facilities or what function they have or what makes them seem suspicious.
According to information provided by the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, they are referred to internally at the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariya, referring to towns nearby.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these locations and found a complex of buildings on satellite images at Masyaf which is very probably one of the suspicious buildings.
It may be located in or immediately next to a military base - it is precisely for this reason that Syria is refusing the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna, there is word that the Syrians were afraid of some kind of fishing expedition and worry that the IAEA is being sent out by the USA as a vanguard to spy out military facilities.
This fear was exacerbated by the fact that nuclear inspectors had been tipped off about the facilities by the US secret services.
The IAEA has documents, including satellite photos, which suggest that material has been transported between the three locations and the cube-shaped building on the Euphrates river.
A high-ranking western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be "related to fuel production."
However, there were "no signs of sensitive activities" such as uranium enrichment or reprocessing - processes that are required to build atomic weapons.
This type of reactor is fuelled by uranium, but not enriched uranium.
However, a reasonable guess could be made as to where the uranium came from and where the plutonium from that uranium would be extracted for use in a bomb.
It remains unclear, however, whether rubble that could contain valuable trace deposits has been stored at the three locations.
No one is admitting to having any information on where the rubble has ended up, as if hundreds of truckloads of earth had simply vanished into thin air.
The salt mine of Al Tibni, located just several kilometres from El Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates and investigated by Syria in 1998 as a possible storage location for radioactive waste is an unlikely location, according to the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently connected the mine and the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine, Jane's Intelligence Review.
Images from orbit, however, show that Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had demanded access.
That may be coincidence, but has done nothing to clear suspicion.
There is also talk in diplomatic circles of the IAEA having spent a number of months developing an inspections plan that would allow Syria to protect any military secrets - the costs alone shows the extent of the inspectors" interest.
Damascus, however, also brushed off this proposal.
Although western diplomats in Vienna had offered reassurance, by saying that since the reactor was destroyed the issue had low priority, the US ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing so-called special inspections to the table, which is one of the most powerful instruments available to the Vienna-based atomic authority to carry out inspections.
Yukiya Amano, current Director General of the IAEA, who is believed to have suggested the inspection, has already spoken of "an option that I am open to in the future," but is still hesitating.
The option is high risk. On the one hand it requires a majority in the Governing Council of the IAEA, and a number of the 35 countries represented are anything other than eager for escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "what if, in the end, they find nothing?"
