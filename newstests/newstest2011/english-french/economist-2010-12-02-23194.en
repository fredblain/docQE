Tiptoeing to the centre
In the weeks since she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, Argentina's president, has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has boosted her approval rating by 20 points, to over 50%, its highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term at an election next year may depend on whether or not the visibly grieving Ms Fernández abandons the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on that the signs are mixed.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to handle economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was in the habit of drawing up budgets which underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
That allowed the first couple to spend the extra revenues at will.
On paper Ms Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided, and it was thrown further into disarray by Mr Kirchner's death of a heart attack on October 27th.
Some dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement have rallied to Ms Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which a parliamentarian punched another in the face, and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now apply next year, giving the president even more room to spend at will.
The economy is overheating wildly: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and trade-union wage demands - put the figure close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was scarred by economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction, rather than controlling inflation, his priorities.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistics agency, which proceeded to doctor official inflation statistics.
Might Ms Fernández now moderate these policies?
She has called for talks between private business and union leaders.
And her officials are saying that they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been buoyed by high world prices for Argentina's farm exports.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth provided by a big devaluation in 2002.
That may be why Ms Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year the government struck a deal with bondholders who had refused an earlier forced restructuring of debt on which Argentina defaulted in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted this could not involve oversight by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund will provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer-price index, which looks like a prelude to cleaning up INDEC.
It is not clear whether Ms Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term now that her husband is no longer at her side.
If she does, she needs to win the support of the middle class, much of which has tired of kirchnerismo.
By the time Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have ebbed.
If she wants to win another election she will have to decide whether or not quietly to repudiate many of her husband's policies.
