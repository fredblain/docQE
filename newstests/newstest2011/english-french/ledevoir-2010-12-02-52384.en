450 milion' worth of contracts without calls for tender
Hydro-Quebec awarded 450 million dollars' worth of contracts to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the core of this avalanche of over 100 contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR. Dessau, SN Group and Axor, which secured the most important one, that of managing the project for the sum of 295 million dollars without a call for tender.
The consortium called Energie gérance was formed in 2004, leaving it to Hydro-Quebec at its option to pass its responsibility for managing this important hydroelectric project worth 5000 million dollars to the private sector.
At the beginning of 2005 the Energie gérance consortium secured this lucrative contract without a prior public call for tender.
As far as the Quebec Party is concerned, recourse to company consortia poses a serious problem, that of elimination of competition and of an increase of price.
"This is the new way of colluding and defeating competition."
"This means that rather than behaving secretively, people now behave openly," declared the Quebec Party deputy Silvain Simard at a Press conference.
Earlier during the morning M. Simard raised the question in the National Assembly, because he found it difficult to see how the public interest could be served in that way.
Replying in the afternoon, the Minister of Natural Resources Nathalie Normandeau, denied vigorously any collusion in connection with this contract.
"I am starting my journey," she stormed, maintaining that the Quebec Party had been "dishonest" and "lacking rigour."
She said that "it would be the least thing" for the Quebec Party to excuse itself.
The formula of the consortia is current practice throughout the world.
What is usually involved is an alliance limited over time, which allows two or more companies to combine their respective expertises in order to respond to a call for tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project comprises a high level of complexity, taking into account the extent of the works.
The site is in progress and must extend until 2012.
The contract was awarded without involving competition; there were negotiations.
Likewise, the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even in respect of relatively simple projects.
As was disclosed last week by Le Devoir, the formula of consortia in the engineering consultancy sector is the subject of a government inquiry.
A brief inspection of the register of Quebec companies shows the existece of over 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
So, for example, the Desseau company works in partnership with the majority of its principal competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others such as Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination and there are tens of them, comes back to one and the same company, namely Desseau.
As far as the Energie gérance consortium is concerned, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James complies with the specific labour dynamics and that Hydro-Quebec has complied with them specifically since the nineteen seventies."
The head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ) gave an explanation, which raised eyebrows about the fact that the project management contract had been awarded by mutual agreement.
"If you launch a call for tender and if there are few tenderers, your prices will be too high."
"You have two options; either you accept the people who are in that market and you say that we will negotiate a satisfactory alliance and a good price." or you take the people who are in that market and you say that we will negotiate a satisfactiory alliance and a good price." we will negotiate a satisfactory alliance and a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price which is impportant, but people's skills" stated M. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energie gérance consortium, forms part of a long list of contracts of over 50 000 $ secured by the Quebec Psrty.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts awearded between 2002 and 2010 to companies or to their subsidiaries, especially soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin grabbed 22 contracts, Génivar 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting its participation in Eergie gérance.
All the contracts were negotiated.
They total 449 783 344 $, including the contract awarded to Energie gérance worth 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain Simard let it be known that the four companies comprsing the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SN and Axor) are "well known to Quebec Liberal Party."
Minister Normandeau let slip that the Quebec Party is also linked to these companies who "finance" it, before stating that it was rather its directors, who were involved.
