Alert on pesticides consumed by children.
According to a study published o Wednesday by the Future Generations association (formelry Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations), a child of 10 consumes in one day 81 different chemical substances.
The association which predicts that its results do not possess, in view of the small number of samples analysed, any significant statistical value, but illustrate the problem being dealt with, has bought in spermarkets of the Oise and of Paris between July and September, the basket of foodstuffs generally consumed in four meals by a child of ten.
These meals inclduing official recommendations, five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water as well as delicacies, were examined by clinical research laboratories dealing with chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is staggering: 81 chemical substances including 42 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as definitely carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances able to induce endocrine disorders, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre. 81 substances chimiques dont 42 sont classées cancérigènes possibles ou probables et cinq substances classées cancérigènes certaines ainsi que 37 substances susceptibles d'agir comme perturbateurs endocriniens (PE), selon des études de plusieurs institutions telles le Centre international de recherche sur le cancer.
According to the Associaiton, even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits of each chemical substance are not exceeded, our inquiry shows that the reality of exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic contaminant is worrying.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain over ten possible and three proven carcinogenic residues and almost twenty residues potentially able to disturb the hormone system.
An apple from Brazil contains traces of six chemical substances incluing a fungicide, prohibited in France.
The same applies to beans from Kenya included in a luncheon, in which the study found traces of a powerful insecticide prohibited in the European Union.
In addiiton, minced steak, canned tuna and even a baguette and chewing gum contained pesticides and other chemicals.
Tapwater contained nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the "richest," with 34 chemical residues and even the plastic plate used for warming the meal in a microwave, was not exempt.
According to the study, the final risk for the consumer in this "contaminant cocktail" is probably underestimated.
For its part, the European Ecology Alliance - the Greens proposed, in view of the urgency of the situation, the introduction of a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop the growth of civilisation's diseases.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency pointed to the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe including 76 in cereals.
