A worldwide plan for renewing lighting.
Yesterday at Cancun UNO put forward a plan of renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to securing a reduction of greenhouse gases (GES) corresponding to almost one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilise the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is one of a number of concrete projects, which UNO hopes to have adopted at Cancun to offset the absence of mandatory reduction undertakings by industrialised countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still hold 50 to 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs, or better still, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or LED in English), the bulk of the 1.8 thousand million tonnes of GES emitted on the planet to provide illumination for human beings, would be avoided.
Illumination is responsible for 8% of worldwide emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions by the world's motor vehicles.
Last year at Copenhagen the high emissions countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others including Canada, adopted voluntary plans of reduction to bring down global emissions of GES from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this figure a further 5 Gt to stabilise the increase of climate warming by 2020 at 2Â°C in order to avoid loss of control.
In incandescent bulbs 95% of energy is dissipated in the form of heat and only the remaining 5% produce light.
With fluocompact bulbs, the dissipation of energy is reduced by 75% and with the new DEL bulbs, the energy requirement is additionally reduced by double that amount.
Fluocompact bulbs last on an average between 6000 and 10 000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs such as those launched by Philips this week, Philips having morepover participated in a UNO study, have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than incandescent bulbs, giving an idea of the saving, which would be possible in a plan of replacement applicable to 100 countries.
These entirely novel bulbs can also work with rheostats, emitting very little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have voiced revervations concerning fluocompact bulbs, because they contain mercury and because it is necessary to dispose of them as dangerous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers issue instructions.
But, states the report, the principal source of mercury emission on the planet is not the fluocompast bulb, but rather carbon thermal emission centres, which emit a lot of mercury to produce the electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these centres emit 25 000 tonnes of mercury a year.
The report details the gains, which every country would achieve through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a thousand million dollars a year on purchases of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal centres, whose construction would cost 2.5 thousand million dollars.
