The government wants to limit the torture of "witches," a brochure was released
Women declared as witches in Burkina Faso usually have several common characteristics.
They rather come from the older generation, cannot engage in work for health reasons for instance, are unmarried and have no children.
The one who "becomes" a witch is sent into isolation in order to not jeopardize the rest of the village.
"Such a fate befalls men only very rarely."
"Nor healthy young women are sent away because they help with work and bear children," says the nun, who takes care for more than a hundred women banished from their community in a special care home in the capital of Burkina Faso, West Africa.
Local government now decided to combat the unusual "social measures."
It has published an information booklet, which should help limit the witch-hunt.
But there is a snag in that.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," pointed out the disadvantage of written education Die Standard daily.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which borders with Burkina Faso, a seventy-two Amma Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, doused in kerosene and set alight.
The case was reported by BBC.
The perpetrators claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version the oil that is used for ritual anointing ignited and burned the woman to death.
It allegedly burst into flames after the group wanted to "expel the evil spirit" from the woman.
Isolation of "witches" is widely supported by people regardless of their education level.
Daily Der Standard quoted a businessman of forty-two from Burkina Faso: "Devourers of human souls have always posed a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying hard to moderate the witch hunt, the Gambia's President himself participated in the hunt last year.
"Gambian President Jámí after the death of his aunt unleashed a large-scale witch-hunt for witches allegedly involved in her death and trying to use black magic to kill the president."
"He invited shamans from nearby Guinea to help him and they accompanied by policemen, soldiers and president's private security guards forced randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president's ranch in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in their report.
The arrested people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also causes intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners did not survive.
After international pressure nearly a thousand of inmates were released.
