American troops have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army deployed a new "smart weapon" in Afghanistan, known so far only by a codename XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a superaccurate small cannon.
Their projectile is directed by a laser to hit within a few meters.
Special ammunition caliber 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing high explosive, in fact, act like little grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode when hitting the target, but at any point of their ballistic path.
They can be used against an enemy who is hiding behind a barrier, behind walls or in trenches.
These are usually not protected from the above, and if hit by the rain of deadly shards of steel, they may not fight any more.
According to Richard Audetta who participated in the development of XM-25 rifle, it is a new first weapon for the infantry, which uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically operates it as follows: they find a target, it sends a laser beam to determine the distance and thus the precise explanation of the point, they adjust the elevation and squeeze the trigger."
"Let's say that you have obtained 543 meters."
"When you squeeze the trigger, the gun charges, and fires a missile at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus one, two or three meters," said Audette.
