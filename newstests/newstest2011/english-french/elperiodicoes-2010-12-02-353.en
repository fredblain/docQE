Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to maintain the Euro, but has established the conditions for all the Union.
The market tensions have brought about a double governmental response.
On the one hand, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has suggested new measures of adjustment, from fiscal reductions to the SMEs, regulation of private agencies of positioning or suppression of the 426 Euros of aid to unemployed without contributions, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and of 30% of Lotteries of the State.
On the other hand, Vice-president Elena Salgado, with the support of the ex-president Felipe Gonz√°lez, has added to the critics to the councillor Angela Merkel her responsibility in untying the present crisis.
How can those movements be interpreted?
She continues that the position of Merkel is not an error in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another bolt tightening in the difficult process of redefinition of the Euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision on how its future must be like, that contradicts the one of maintaining the old traditions of its main partners.
Against the European resistance, in Germany there are speculations on three possible exits from the crisis.
First, a strong Euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among others countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
Second, the recovery of the German mark, although now seems to be science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, near 50% of the population.
Third, a redesign of the Euro, according to the German proposals of greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to the transgressor countries, possible suspensions of payments to some of them and extension of the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and comes defining itself over a long time, so there are no excuses.
Firstly, in 2009, when as much the IMF as the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government presented a constitutional reform in order to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought it had to do (plans of fiscal strictness and stability in the public finances), and what its European partners were doing, including France.
The second headache for the Central European country was when Merkel laboriously extended the decision of rescuing Greece.
Then it was the object of ferocious critic, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published one were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, during the last days of October, Merkel emerges again with a clear position, demanding the reform of treaties of the Union, in order to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time forcing, the private moneylenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since it has precipitated the Irish crisis and all the rest.
But her proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the next months, we would have to attend the process of reform of the Union that makes possible those measures starting with 2013.
Germany has drawn up a red line that does not warrant crossing.
And it is saying to us all that, although now it has to take measures with which perhaps it does not agree, starting with that date the old functioning of the Euro, will have been finished.
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the violating countries will be severely sanctioned, can be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector also will support part of the cost.
Germany is telling us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rates of saving and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity, competitiveness and positive balances.
Another alternative based on the debt and the construction, with enormous deficits in the balance of payments, as the one faced by Spanish growth during the years of the boom, will not be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
We should better understand it.
It is not about trying to lead back the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they ask us is much harder.
And the worst thing than we could do in these circumstances is to kid ourselves.
I hope that the present turbulences would open the path to a greater tranquillity
and that we take advantage of the time that they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that president Zapatero has understood it the same way and its double manifest (the reforms promised after the meeting of the last Saturday with the great companies and the announcement of yesterday of new measures) suggests that, in spite of the critics to Merkel, has laid way to the thesis according to which one should put order in the house.
But the red line that Germany has drawn up there it is, and it does seem that is going be moved.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, the one of leaving a monetary zone of little serious countries cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany will always tell us that it had warned us.
