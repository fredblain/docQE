Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patron opponent "block"
With reforms to the Organic law of Congress, a "two-party system" emerges, they say.
The 60 Legislature wasn't settled when a competing block arose in congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself as independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of the "two-party system" to the Camera.
Before beginning the session establishing the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, from Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, from the PRD; and Patron Montalvo, were against the reform of the Statutory law, given that it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, will begin ' the two-party system," because now there will be two representatives and an equal number of parties, that will control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Directive Table, headed by the PAN supporter Salvador Lopez Brito and Luis Antonio Cardenas Fonseca, in his character of vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality from the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the near future they will speak with the representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be dominated once again by both parties and in this way the competing coalition was brought to a close.
How far they have got (the competing coalition), is what I see, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference of considering the opinion of the rest.
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and for that reason they are forming a plural group.
It is not possible to allow, he continued, that the Congress after having been monopolistic, now is a "two-party system."
"It is not the spirit of the reform the law that has an eternal two-party system in the Congress."
In order to begin, this group is initiating with 5 legislators, and is talking with other companions so that they could be more, added the convergent.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT, explained that at the moment the Congress became a "plunder" between two, with reference to PAN and PRI."
Before it was only one party, now it is being divided between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked for the personality of the deputy to be respected and to give him his place at the negotiation tables."
Not for leaders' agreements, should be left outside 5 and probably we are going be 9 deputies, right now the five that we see, separated into different fractions, we have decided order to look for a slot in the negotiation table, that is the subject of the reforms reform that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree to that reform."
