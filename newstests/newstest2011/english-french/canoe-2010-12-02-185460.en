Clandestine migration can be pursued without probems
According to the government, the conservatives' draft law should solve the problem of boatloads of illegal migrants, but will in all probability be defeated, since the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly rely on the Charter."
"I support ther party, which created the granite beneath your feet" declared the liberal chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
The liberals claim that the draft law in its present form which would anable any person from a ship identified as carrying clandestine immigrants, would violate the Canadian charter of rights and liberties.
The chief of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe has also said that he could not support the draft law, because its aim is wrong.
"We are opposed and it appears that all the opposition parties are opposed and we will now see what the government does" declared M. Ducepe
The critic of NPD concerning immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the out of hand the criticisms statign that her party was not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
"the neo-democrats approve the taking of steps against persons handling illegal immigrants and this is what we are doing by means of another draft law, the C-35" stated Mme Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' draft law because it attacks refugees and imprisons their children for at least a year," explained Mme Chow.
The Minister of Immigration. Jason Kenney, accused the opposition parties of playing politics and of ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling deputies loud and clear that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal immigration, these criminal operations which target Canada and which treat the country like a doormat."
"They expect Canada to adopt firm measures" was the reaction of Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on the draft law, which could bring about elections in the event of its rejection.
A Conservative has however told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every opposed deputy shall explain his reasons to his electors.
