Talent war for graduates with potential
There is a rush on at the buffet.
16 students are shoving their way to salmon rolls, tomato soup and desert.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car maker Volkswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
They are going talk shop on the car of the future with VW developers in a kind of idea contest - and, incidentally, find out more about Volkswagen.
Many companies are already engaged in hand-to-hand combat in the contest for the cleverest minds, and are relying on cooperation with universities, just like VW.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture hall - before they come onto the job market and are courted by anyone else.
And because universities do not provide a breakdown of student performance, companies are looking for and hoping to attract exceptional talent in hands-on projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Braunschweig, the car maker it out to woo the talent.
A young woman from human resources distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bears and folders bearing the VW logo.
She tells the young hopefuls about internships and student jobs, and explains the various routes into the company.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is managing the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both sides. "The students get in contact with industry and gain some experience."
"VW can get to know students while taking a closer look at interesting candidates and thinking about which ones are their potential employees."
Such cooperation, thinks Sells, is not unusual.
What is new is that students are being touted so aggressively.
"The focus used to be on specialism-specific projects," says Selle.
The fight for the latest batch of graduates is set to be a lot tougher.
In many sectors, companies can no longer identify their employees from the hoards of applicants.
They really have to sell themselves to win over highly qualified graduates.
Graduates in engineering find themselves particularly well placed for negotiation.
According to the Association of German Engineers (VDI), more than 40,000 engineering jobs were unfilled in October.
And the shortage of engineers is going to get worse, according to VDI.
Roman Dykta is on the hunt for talent for KPMG, the audit, tax and advisory services firm.
He organises lavish recruitment events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt where participants have to find their route using GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight promising students straight across the USA next year.
And quite incidentally, the participants will see KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Who gets to go is decided in two advance selection rounds.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants will fly to the USA.
Amidst all the war cries surrounding university graduates with potential, the rifle shots from some companies are getting louder and louder, says Dykta.
"With this race, we want to stand out from the crowd."
"Just one trip wasn't enough for us."
For talent-hunter Dykta, the sums add up.
"To this day, we have stayed in contact with all the participants of a similar campaign last year."
"Some of them are just about to graduate and expect to apply to us soon," he says.
Besides direct touting on campus, small and medium-sized businesses especially are stalking candidates at classic career fairs.
"We try to reach graduates at fairs."
"For example, at Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, head of human resources at the solar technology manufacturer, Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe is well aware of the problem of attracting young talent.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company website.
"It is really very difficult to fill vacant positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another route is contact via university lecturers.
Solarworld is cooperating with a number of universities, including Freiberg University.
"The lecturers point out that the students can do internships or write their dissertations with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists are not in the pipeline.
On the other hand, the company is trying to advertise with its other advantages, including a relaxed working atmosphere, flat hierarchies and straightforward communication.
"A big corporation cannot often offer that," says human resources manager Stübe.
Money has not been the key factor in the job market for a while.
Flexible working time, childcare and good promotion opportunities are also decisive factors.
Solarworld came in 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The institute publishes an annual league table of German employers.
It asks employees how happy they are with their work and job environment and looks at the general working conditions.
Human resources manager Stübe hopes to score points with job-seekers thanks to the company's place on the list.
"I think that applicants are influenced strongly by external assessments of any potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy is an advisor for companies seeking to develop a reputation as a good employer as part of a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And that actually means internal changes, says Kriegler.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is via your own employees," he says.
In industry jargon, that means Employer Branding among your own employees.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your own well and they identify with the company, then they will find you new employees among their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in a band," says Kriegler.
