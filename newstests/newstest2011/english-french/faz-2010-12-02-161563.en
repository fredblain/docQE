The Ice Cream University
Ice cream confectioners are being trained for the warm seasons at the "Gelato University" in Bologna.
The three-day foundation course for future "gelatieri" is the largest course, and welcomes visitors from all over the world.
Where does all that ice cream actually come from?
From the "gelatiere" and the "gelataio."
The "gelatiere," known in English as the old-fashioned "ice cream confectioner," produces the cream following the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The "gelataio" gets the ice cream out of the refrigerated counter with a spatula, smoothes it into wafers and sells it.
You do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna to know that.
But for anyone who wants to know more about ice cream, the "Gelato University" of the Italian Carpigiani company is a must.
The ice cream university was created by the manufacturer of ice cream makers in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from all its makers met exacting Italian standards.
The three-day foundation course for future "gelatieri" is the largest course, and welcomes visitors from all over the world.
There are also specialised courses over several days covering chocolate ice cream, and internships in the company's own ice cream parlour.
Many dream of a new career to escape a mid-life crisis; others come to test their vague aspirations against the cold facts.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries and every continent - from Brazil and Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a high-quality European product in a country accustomed to industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to do something on her own after years in a highly stressful job.
Two young Egyptian girls dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia has come because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelatiere Luciano Ferrari begins the course by describing the ideal characteristics of a perfect ice cream.
Not only a good flavour, but silky softness and good texture are key.
Training the course, Luciano does not forget to mention the real icing on the cake for the national and thoroughly southern monolith. "Italian gelato is simply the best - after that, it's all just romance."
The first step of production seems very easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients - milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers - into a large blender that heats the mixture to 85 degrees on an electronic programme and then immediately cools it to four degrees.
Then he turns a tap on the machine and out comes a pasteurised, basic white ice cream, the basic for all milk-based ice creams.
The lecturer is immediately overwhelmed by questions. Can you make ice cream using natural ingredients only without stabilisers?
How can you experiment freely on your own?
Luciano warns against letting the spirit of the age lead you astray.
Anyone who talks about making ice cream "using natural ingredients only" has probably used stabilisers anyway - in most cases a natural product such as guar gum from guar beans.
Of course, you can make ice cream without stabilisers, but then you have to sell it within a day, as otherwise it collapses and your customer ends up licking lumps of ice.
Some variations to the base are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the flavours.
For ice cream flavouring, Maestro Luciano differentiates between the ingredients you buy in the fruit section and in the sweet section of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to get you to get you to buy dozens of flavoured additives.
But you should just experiment."
Either with fruit sorbets using sugar and fresh fruits,
or with a white ice cream base that can be turned into yellow cream by using eggs or can be mixed with cocoa powder to form the base of all kinds of seductive chocolate.
At last the course participants are allowed onto the ice cream maker.
Luciano lets each of them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base and with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural ingredients.
The experiment is repeated with the range of fruit sorbets.
More flavourings, more fruit purée - not necessarily an improvement in taste.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The team that produces the most popular kiwi ice cream uses more fruit, less water and a little less of the stabiliser.
The taste of a gelato only really stands out if the mixture is balanced, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a matter of arithmetic. If sugary peach purée is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe has to be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano brings out a device that shows him the sugar content of the types of fruit (vintners use it to measure the density of grape must using the Oechsle scale).
Fortunately, tables make the calculations easier.
Making ice cream does not require as much physical activity as it once did.
It is not just the machine, which produces the base.
There is also a device that beats the finished ice cream mixture to a creamy consistency while cooling it to negative temperatures.
But despite all automation, minor accidents still occur.
The Brazilian Gustavo covers himself and his course mates from head to toe with fruit purée as he loses control of the oversized hand-held blender.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
