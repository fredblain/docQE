Households will pay extra hundreds for housing a month
Households will have to pay more since January, not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sewerage, heating supplies, and rents will rise in certain areas.
Families will have to pull out monthly hundreds more from purses from January.
The price of electricity will be raised up by 4.6 percent; gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, in some towns you will have to pay extra for water by up to a tenth and supply of central heating will often be more expensive.
Electricity price increase should cost houshould s in the flats hundreds of crowns a year more than now.
Prices of power energy were reduced by all the major suppliers at the same time; a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics, is to blame then.
Although gas will only be slightly more expensive, it will happen when most people are heating their flats and thus have the highest consumption.
Annually they must then also take extra costs in account.
While electricity and gas will be more expensive across the country, central heating price change varies from place to place.
Price increase is planned mainly in larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Kralove will pay since January for central heating about CZK 50 per month extra, families in Liberec will pay extra CZK 1,000 a year.
Residents of Prague may have more expensive water and sewer by more than 9 percent, in the event that the city increases the rent of the infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, Prague residents will pay extra 6.8 percent.
Price in Prague, however, will still be in a nationwide comparison rather low.
In the North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, the water rate should increase by about 7.4 percent.
For example, the price of rent in 450 thousands of rental apartments, where regulation ends in January, may significantly increase.
For example, CPI Byty, which in Usti nad Labem owns about 2,500 apartments, plans to raise the rent from January by up to one hundred percent.
The company intends to bring to the court those who will not accept the new rents.
Regulated rents paid by people in approximately 300 thousand apartments could increase by up to ten percent next year.
