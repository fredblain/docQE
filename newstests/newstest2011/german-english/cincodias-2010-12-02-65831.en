The CECA discards a second big wave of fusions in the saving banks
The chief of a main directorate of the CECA, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, discarded yesterday that a big wave of fusions of savings banks is going to take place and insisted once again on the speed with which the reconstruction of the sector is being made.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks started, the there were several organizations that assured that they would not participate in this first stage and that they would be expect the second round.
Nevertheless, the chief of a main directorate of the Spanish Confederation of Savings banks (CECA), Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, discarded yesterday that this new big wave of operations is going to take place.
I believe that the greatest part of the fusions has occurred, the incorporation of Cajasol to the group of Banca Civica cannot be called a second round, there are only adjustments.
" The biggest part is completely done; perhaps instead of 17 we could have 13 or 14 but all the great processes have been done under the surveillance of Bank of Spain, that has collaborated very many to this matter," pointed the manager.
In declarations during a breakfast of the Manager Association and Executives of Arag√≥n (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the concentration process is being undertaken " with the greatest possible speed, and we must be very satisfied of how this happens in the terms that at the time, not now, were marked in the plans of business with the Bank of Spain," he emphasized.
To go from 45 saving banks with an average of 28.500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that does not have comparison in history, reducing the number of organizations to a 62% so that they are much bigger to fulfil Basilea , he underlined.
Olavarrieta recognized that there is "a series of opinions rather pessimistic on the slowness of the process" that demonstrates "a lack of seriousness and reason," because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we must fulfil the term before the end of year."
The chief of a main directorate of CECA, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the more rigorous financial system of all Europe and "probably" of the whole world, and he attributed to those who call into question the "lack of knowledge."
The manager showed that, within the present economic conjuncture, "we can be very relaxed" with the situation of the financial organizations and the savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and that "goes with the greatest possible speed."
Also he remembered that the Spanish bank came out very well with the stress tests that the BCE made in July.
