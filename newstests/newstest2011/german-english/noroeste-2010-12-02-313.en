A magician is looked for
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among others toys, are the yearning of the children of the family Coronado from Valenzuela.
For his parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please his illusions, since their home is made out of no more than 12 people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, Jose Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaias, Jose Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melcher, Gaspar and Balthazar will give them the toys and clothes they so much wish.
The family lives in a humble house of the Colony Salvador Allende and lives in poor conditions because the father does not have a job.
Sometimes it is very hard for us because my husband does not have a job, but we sell mandarin and daddy... in the afternoon I leave with the kids to sell in the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the children.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
On the other hand, Jose Alfredo, 10 years old, has wished for a very long time to have a "monster" car and for his brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothes suitable for a one year baby.
He told me (Jose Alfredo), I would like this monster," but I said "we will see son" because it was very expensive," remembered Cayetana with sadness.
For the elder children that were at school clothes and shoes would be perfect.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaias, 10 years old, is size 10, whereas Miguel, 8 years old, uses size eight.
Jose Juan, 14 years old, needs tennis, reason why a pair of size five and a half or six would helpful to him.
If you want to make this dream come true for the children of the Coronado family from Valenzuela you can participate in the campaign as there is a need for a Magician, by donating a toy or cash at the reception of the Noroeste.
