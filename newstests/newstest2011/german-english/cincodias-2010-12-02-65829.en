Sabadell bets on "stealing" one million clients from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other managers, the delegated advisor of Sabadell Bank, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank, but discards initially a new crisis of liquidity and predicts the end of the war of liabilities.
In spite of it, he anticipates a collapse of the margins of interests that will try to partly compensate with raised commissions and the price of the credit.
Sabadell hopes to catch in three years a million particular clients.
Sabadell has found a way of exploiting the next three years and being able to survive in very complicated economic surroundings.
The bank will start up in 2011 a new director plan that will have a validity of three years.
The objective, besides surviving without needing to appeal to the public aid of FROB, is to gain market quota by getting a million of new particular clients -700.000 if are discounted those that might leave the bank, pending on assignment, since until now they spoiled more the SMEs and companies than the retail client.
This year has caught 250.000 particular clients and 50.000 companies.
Its market quota of individuals is of 3,5%, whereas in companies surpasses 10%.
Another base of the plan 2011-2013 is the bet on productivity, meaning, of austerity, with reduction of costs as objective, and whose challenges will be exhibited by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare during these times to set objectives and make them public since the financial crisis has changed all of the plans for the global bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its director plan Optima, hired four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market conditions forced him to extend it into one more year.
The clients who give up savings will be his main objective.
During a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 " is going to be a difficult and transcendental year."
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years there will be "very difficult to create jobs," something fundamental for the survival of the banking business.
And, although he thinks that the war of the liabilities - that penalizes the margins- is being reduced, the price of the risk subsidies that banks are paying for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity are already moving to the cost of the credit to compensate the fall of the margins.
The subject of liquidity and financing is fundamental, and is going to be a pressure factor on credit.
"We haven't closed the faucet, but the differentials are more important," recognized Guardiola.
Banesto already issued orders on Thursday to his network to limit the long term credit and to raise the price of the differentials - See CincoDÃ­as from 22nd and 27th of November.
Also he recognized that the tendency of the bank now "it is to raise the commissions," but "within a competitive frame."
The director plan of Sabadell is based on the organic growth, although, as always, the group does not discard corporative operations.
Not in vain, assures that in Spain "major sizes are going to be required."
"Next year everything will move," he assured.
He affirms that capital needs have "risen too much" and it does not discard that some Spanish financial organization enters within red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fundraising before new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closing of the markets, he pays attention to which some bankers already predicted as a new crisis of liquidity.
He says that there cannot be emitted, but unlike to what had happened in June, is possible to obtain short term financing through agreements, which softens the crisis.
