Sport and fraud law
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate wittiness but not the will to get remove of a sanction.
The expulsion presumably forged by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game played on the 23rd of November against Ajax in Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about if such behaviour is or is not unsportsmanlike and if, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we all know, a few minutes before the end of the game (that their team had already won), both players deliberately wasted time which made the referee show the second yellow card to both of them.
This way, and since Real Madrid will finish as leader of its group, both players will fulfil the prescribed sanction during the next game of league, against Auxerre, and will be able to get rid of the cards the following phase.
Finally, the committee of discipline of the UEFA has sanctioned with two games the trainer of the team, Jose Mourinho, and with different economic amounts the implied players.
The provocation of a yellow card in similar circumstances as this one is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so extended that it part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed nonetheless by this sport.
Part of the debate arisen in the related case is caused by the fact that has been carried out by team of the Real Madrid organization (that in its hymn presumes of nobility and honour, and that has fined its players for analogous acts) and by the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more to his expanded history of histrionic and provoking technician.
Anyway, the debate deals with if that type of behaviour not prohibited specifically by the regulation contradicts the principles of the sport, that is to say, if with these actions fraud is committed; then, indeed, they are respectful actions with the sport regulation, but they seem to elude its sense.
The matter examines the type of damage that is brought to the sporting spirit.
One of the advantages that include the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, aspect that with these actions wasn't put into danger, that is to say, there was no violent game.
Another of these advantages to which it is alluded to with the fare-play is to avoid that the team of the law breaker players takes advantage unjustly of the opposite team, which did not happen either.
However, the paradoxical thing about the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not comply to what we normally characterize as legal fraud, because the violation of the rules was not made secretly as to try to avoid the sanction, but their action was most evident and thus they received punishment from the referee.
They waited for and accepted the sanction with no complaints.
Another question is what type of advantage the violators obtained in the actions deliberately carried out.
Here it seems necessary to state that it isn't a disadvantageous situation for rival nor is an obtained benefit in the same game, because evidently the result of the action supposes leaving their own team with less players.
And neither is it a useful strategy for the next game, because the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, consists in the fact that the players will begin the following phase of the Championship without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is about a long term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team can be eliminated first of change, and in addition with this action the players fulfil a sanction game and go to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by card accumulation takes place with one less than in the first cycle.
So that, by passing rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
Those actions are really against the sporting spirit, which is part of the strategic decisions that favour taking advantages allowed by the rules.
Regarding this assumption, the players did not act in order to avoid the application of the sanction (this would have been a clear case of legal fraud), but rather chosen when to obey it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding the punishment.
Although the border between the wittiness and the law fraud is diffuse, in this occasion I believe it was a clear case of wittiness.
The controversy seems to arise from two factors: because it was about two auto expulsions and the way the transmission of the directive was carried out to cause them.
The damage brought about to the principles of the sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.
