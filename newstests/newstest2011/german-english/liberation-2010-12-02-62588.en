Vengeful hackers and spies are waiting.
The WikiLeaks affair has a double significance.
On the one hand, it is a scandal, which only looked scandalous in the light of the hypocrisy which prevails in relations between States, citizens and the Press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on international level and points to a future dominated by regression.
But let us take things in the right order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is a confirmation of the fact that every secret service case (of any country) consists solely of Press cuttings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi only report what it was possible to read for months in any daily (except in those belonging to Berlusconi) and the sinister caricature profile of Khadafi has long been a cabaret artists'sketch material.
The rule according to which secret files may only contain already known news is essential for secret services dynamic and not only in the present century.
If you visit a library devoted to American publications, you will see that every work repeats (concerning the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars, or the Rosicrucians) exactly that which was already set out in earlier works.
And this is so not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do previously unpublished research (and does not know where to look for news about what does not exist), but because those who devote themsslves to occultism, do not believe what they already know and which confirms what they had already learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy and lazy (or limited) is also the head of secret service (otherwise he could be, for all I know, an editor at Liberation), who does not consider to be true what he recognises.
Top secret information about Berlusconi, which the Amereican embassy in Rome sent to the State Department, was the same as that which Newsweek had published the week before.
So why did the revelations about these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say that every cultivated person already knows that embassies have, at least since the end of the Second World War and since heads of State could telephone one another or fly to meet for dinner, lost their diplomatic function and except for some little representation exercises, have become centres of espionage.
Every spectator of investigation films knows this very well and it is hypocritical to pretend that he does not.
Nevertheless, repeating it in public breaches the duty to be hypocritical and only places American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea of a hacker being able to acquire the deepest secrets of the most powerful country in the world represents a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal affects both the victims and the "executioners" equally.
But let us look at the profoud nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in the days of Orwell, one could see all power as Big Brother, who controlled every action of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy proved completely true, since being able to be completely controlled thanks to the telephone, the hotel visited, the motorway taken and so on, the citizen became a total victim of the eye of power.
But when one demonstrates what happens now, that even the secrets of power cannat escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and is able to circulate.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker as the citizen's avenger, can learn all the secrets of power.
How can a power last, if it can no longer keep its secrets?
It is true, as George Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret and can never be discovered; it is also true that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or of Merkel is a secret devoid of secrecy, because it is in the public domain, but to disclose, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Cliton were empty secrets, means taking away all her power.
WikiLeaks did not injure Sarkozy or Merkel, but did considerably injure Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful entity?
Clearly, in future, States will no longer be able to place on line secret information, which would be like posting it on a street corner.
But it is also clear that with current technologies it is useless to hope to be able to discuss confidential reports on the telephone.
Nothing is easier than to discover if and when a head of State has flown away and to contact one of his/her colleagues.
How can private and confidential reports be discussed in the future?
I know very well that for the moment my forecast is science fiction and fanciful, but I have to imagine government agents who travel discreetly by routes which cannot be checked and that they have learned messages by heart, or have concealed written information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be on a single copy kept in a locked dtrawer; basically, the attempted Watergate espionage was less succesul than WikiLeaks. au fond, la tentative d'espionnage du Watergate a eu moins de succ√®s que WikiLeaks.
I had occasion to write that technology goes forward like a crab, namely, backwards.
A century after the invention of wireless telegraphy revolutionised communications, Internet re-established wire telegraphy (telephone).
Video cassettes (analogue) had enabled cinema research workers to explore a film step-by-step going backward and forward and discovering all the secrets of montage, whilst digital CD's only allow jumping from chapter to chapter, namsly by macroportions.
With high-speed trains one can travel from Rome to Milan in three hours, whilst going by air a total of three-and-a-half hours are needed.
Is it therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques revert to horse-drawn carriages.
A last observation.
In other days the Press tried to understand what was happening in secret in embassies.
Now it is embassies which ask the Press for confidnetial information.
