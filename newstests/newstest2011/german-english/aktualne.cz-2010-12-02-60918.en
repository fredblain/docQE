What will they do? CSSD lacks knowledge of both Voldemort and candy bars in Prague
New Councilors of CSSD will most probably have to overcome certain language barriers to understand their old-new colleagues from ODS in Prague Council and municipal council.
Aktuálně.cz "tested" the Social Democrat members of the new Council in terms of the well-established slang that originated in the town hall during the few last years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
Coded vocabulary that was established by Prague political elite during the previous era of the mayor Pavel Bem, describes some of the most famous persons, situations and affairs in the city.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new council members do not understand the well-known concepts.
At least they say so.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really do not know."
"I'm rather a novice in Prague politics," responded Lukas Kaucky, the Councilor for culture, to the test of "Godfather" vocabulary.
And even though he is a political veteran, the Councilor Karel Brezina responded similarly.
For instance regarding the term "golf hole."
"It's the only one of the presented words that I use at least occasionally."
"Otherwise, I generally do not recognize the slang."
Out of the glossary, published by Aktuálně.cz last June just before the Election Congress of ODS, editors selected six examples, mainly well-known in connection with the Prague City Hall.
The Socialists were to explain the concepts of "Voldemort," the "greatest golf hole in Prague," "go to a candy bar," "bull neck," "betrayal of the capital" and "to plate with metal."
Three Councilors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head the education in Prague in the future - promised to attend an interview first, but later he stopped answering the phone.
The fifth Councilor, Peter Dolínek, refused the test straight away.
"I do not pay attention to such things at all and I am not going to evaluate the way the Civic Democrats talk."
"I am rather concerned how we will match our programs," he said.
As we already mentioned, Councilor Lukas Kaucky would reportedly not recognize in the above heading that it is about an influential entrepreneur and friend of ex-Mayor Bem, Roman Janousek.
"Voldemort" bears no meaning to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed in the test is "the greatest golf hole in Prague."
"It's Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky, and immediately adds: "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'll have to get myself a language course," he quips.
Golf hole as the Blanka tunnel was then correctly deciphered by not only the matador Karel Brezina, but also the Councilor for the environment, Lukas Plachy.
Both Social Democrats then also know who is actually Voldemort and Lukas Plachy is familiar with this character - he also guesses the right meaning of the phrase "to go to a candy bar."
"That means going to a company in Prague" he sails close to the meaning, which is the office of Janousek's companies.
Similarly to Brezina he notes that he gained the knowledge from the newspapers rather than using such a vocabulary himself.
According to the testees, there is no such groovy glossary of slang terms in Social Democrats Party.
"I even consulted my colleagues, but it seems that we really do not have anything like that."
"We rather address one another with names, sometimes we use abbreviations and name garbles," said Prague CSSD chairman Peter Hulínský, addressed by party members as Hulda.
"At school I was called Birch, but I do not know if my colleagues call me so," he admits his own nickname, Karel Brezina.
Aktuálně.cz tested the nickname and it works.
Councilor Weinert is Grandpa or less friendly Old Man for party members, the Councilor Miroslav Poche, who won attention just before the election by the fraud in party sponsorship, was nicknamed "Igráček" by some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing accepted by the Social Democrats in the intra-party speech.
Hulínský reportedly does not like to be addressed as Hulda, but Aktuálně.cz has also seen another nickname of that Prague chairman.
"Dr. of Black-jack Law" supposedly recalls that Peter Hulínský got his Degree of JUDr at the Police Academy in Bratislava.
