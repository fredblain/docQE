Puigcercós looks for peace in ERC with winks to those who have the same opinion as Carod
The republican leader will allow the party a secret voting regarding his continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the full meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the prescription for negotiating for the umpteenth time the internal revolt in the ERC, without a sight for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is conscious that his threat of resignation is insufficient for the supporters of the ex- leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector today is so diluted as his own mentor and can cause the him worries that he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will try to gain the new critics with winks that allow him to be protected until the municipal elections.
In order to begin, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisors of ERC could pronounce privately on his continuity.
By means of tickets, and not by raised hand.
If the supporters of Carod want to carry certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do it without fear to retaliation.
In fact, the head of the ranks wants to avoid the division image as much as the one of submission to him.
In several interviews, he affirmed that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without mentioning the percentage, that wouldn't be good either a result " a la Bulgarian."
The close supporters of Carod demand the president something more than putting his position at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the most important organ between congresses.
But for not having the majority sufficient to force resignations, they are going to try to decide with the executive a direction from now until May.
For this, they hope to participate in the elaboration of the document of strategic reorientation that the direction will put under voting of the national advice on day 18.
Its intention is to speak for Puigcercós in exchange for promising to advance the congress to the autumn of 2011, something that the cupola considers already done.
The ERC leader recognized that "polyphony" harms stability and that its objective is to make, once and for all, the organization able to wash the dirty rags inside.
In this line, is symptomatic the article that counsellor in functions Josep Huguet posted on his blog.
Considering the ideologist Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació considers a fulfilled act that the leader will be authenticated "in exchange of diverse objectives."
And he enumerated five, of which two are emphasized.
First, "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is to say, to include new faces that come from the sector compatible with Carod.
The second can be the great newness.
Huguet proposes that ERC eliminates the assembly as an operation mechanism.
Thus, proposes a reform of the statutes that allows celebrating the congresses through delegates chosen by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish system of parties has been an obsession of the team of Puigcercós that already battled in this sense in both last congresses.
In fact, the convulse conclave of the 2008 let the mission of direction review of the assembly in a specific congress of reform of statutes.
This meeting wasn't held yet, because the internal flood of the last years advised against confronting the subject.
Now, without critical sectors on the matter, could be a good moment to retake it and try to close it for always.
