The geriatrician affirms that the deaths were caused by "lack of means"
The owners of the center of Olot do not discard that their attendant killed more than 11 elderly people
The people in charge with the geriatric hospital La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday in order to underline the damage that has caused to the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there killed at least eleven elderly people that he had under surveillance.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the centre's lawyer, lawyer Joan Canada, and announced that " the intention of La Caritat would to pin the blame on the individual responsible for of the deaths but "legality and responsibility forces us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible people."
And that besides the social loss of prestige that the organization can encounter for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the watchman, the great threat for the Caritat has now takes the shape of of a substantial indemnification that is already calculated by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that since then he didn't stop killing.
The judge already mentioned in the document that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old patients of the geriatric hospital- whom she suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the dead bodies but, taking into account the age and the pathologies of the patients, the procedure was made by phone.
La Caritat, through its director, fully denied this end yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures couldn't have been at any moment the cause of what had happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the cause there is no indication that there has been an imprudent action on the part of any other person who is not the guilty one."
The one baptized as "Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders the day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on the 29th of August of 2009 and a month and a half later, killed another grandmother.
In this case an overdose of insulin brought her the death; unlike the first crime he committed with a mixture of sedative tablets.
The director of the Caritat says that it is complicated to control that the personnel of the center have access to medicines.
The overdose of insulin and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the patients, used or killing them.
But the tests that are being carried out in the laboratory will have to clarify if Vila is not lying and tried to assure for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, burned them internally by giving them lye as he already confessed that had done with the three women that he killed between the 12th and the 17th of October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the appearance of the watchman, nor to the number of confessed murders, that they do not refute being superior, and justifies his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and the nonsense of changing his method of killing after having successfully committed, eight murders.
This is why they say they put themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the reach of this event.
