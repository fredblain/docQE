Deutsche Bank seeking buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to sell its emblem. According to a newspaper report, the bank is looking for buyers for the two office high-rises at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could fetch up to 500 million Euros.
Deutsche Bank only recently renovated its company headquarters. The twin towers in the Frankfurt banking quarter have been modernised as bankers returned to their former workplace.
But the financial institution now clearly wants to recoup the costs of renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rises, writes Financial Times Germany, quoting a spokesman.
The spokesman did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are constantly reviewing whether it is better to own property ourselves or to sell it and then rent it back," he said.
Germany's largest financial institution is abandoning its company headquarters after only a limited period of time.
The bank first took over the two towers for 272 million Euros in mid-2007 from the investors of one of its own funds and went on to implement an extensive programme of renovation.
According to the information available, the extensive renovation cost around 200 million Euros.
A sale would earn the bank a lot of money.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers, renamed the "Greentowers," at around 500 million Euros.
Whether the buildings will be resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently not decided, said the spokesman.
