EU changes the rules for obtaining the visa
Applicants will have to go to the centres of Attendance for Visa Applicants before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be smaller and so will waiting times.
From the 10th of January of 2011 the procedure of issuing a visa in the Embassy of the United States and consulates will be altered.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to go to the attendance centres for Visa Applicants (ASC, by its English abbreviations) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the biometric information of the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for the applicants, among which:
The total cost of issuing the visa will be smaller; it will no longer be necessary to make a payment in order to get the appointment, another payment to process the visa request and another one so that the service of correspondence gives the document.
The applicant will make only one payment which will cover the three services.
The present tariff will remain unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for cases of visas with request (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for visas of retailers and investors.
People who wish to renew their visa won't have to go to an interview with the Consular Official, but they will only have to go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and will have fingerprints taken.
Because the biometric information will be taken in the ASC, the applicants who require a second date for being interviewed in the Consular Section will attend one less time than previously.
Also,those requesting a visa in the Consulates of Ciudad Ju√°rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra tariff on service of 26 dollars.
