Amazon blocks server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting into deeper and deeper waters.
The e-commerce company Amazon has banned the whistleblower from its servers.
Political pressure may stand behind the move following publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, is believed to be in England.
The whistle blowing website, Wikileaks, is increasingly under fire in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their American server and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called upon other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
In the meantime, a newspaper report suggests Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, is currently in Great Britain.
"Wikileaks forced off Amazon servers."
"Free speech in the land of the free," said the whistle blowing activists on Wednesday (local time) via the Twitter messaging service.
A short while previously, the internet company Amazon had banned Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic dispatches in order to be able to cope with the high number of people accessing the documents.
Wikileaks discussed the step on Twitter: "Great - we'll spend our dollars employing people in Europe instead."
If Amazon had issues with freedom of speech, "it should give up selling books."
Amazon stopped Wikileaks using its servers after colleagues of Senator Joe Lieberman started to investigate, reported the broadcaster CNN, quoting Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs had threatened to boycott Amazon, reported the British newspaper "The Guardian."
"I would have liked to see Amazon take this step earlier, considering the previous publication of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman also called on other countries to cooperate in preventing Wikileaks from finding new servers.
"Wikileaks" illegal, outrageous, and reckless acts have compromised our national security and put lives at risk around the world," the non-party Senator stated in a statement.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should assist Wikileaks in its efforts to disseminate these stolen materials."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authority on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to a report in the London-based newspaper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian is currently in the UK, and Scotland Yard is aware of his exact location.
The internet activist has always described the Swedish investigations as a scheme orchestrated by his detractors.
In London, Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said that threats had been made.
"There have even been calls to assassinate Julian Assange."
Hrafnsson said that Assange was therefore afraid for his personal safety.
The Wikileaks founder will remain in hiding.
Hrafnsson was clearly reacting to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had called for the people responsible for the Wikileaks revelations to be indicted and executed for treason.
In Canada, one of Prime Minister Stephen Harper's advisers ironically suggested on television that Assange should be "killed" and that Obama could "use a drone."
In the meantime, exchanges have been made between the White House and Assange.
Robert Gibbs, the speaker of American President Barack Obama, said that it was "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she is found responsible for recently revealed requests to diplomats to engage in espionage.
"I'm not entirely sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far stronger than his one website."
The American government is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of the security of its databases.
Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Information Division at the National Anti-Terrorism Centre, has been appointed as a special representative, the White House announced.
Travers will be responsible for developing the "necessary structural reforms" that are now needed following the disclosure of diplomatic dispatches by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to look at how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The American government also expressed its concern for the safety of dissidents and activists who may be put at risk by the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything to contact them," said States Department Spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if that becomes necessary."
