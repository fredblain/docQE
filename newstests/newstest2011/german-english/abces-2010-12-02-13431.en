Mónica Juanatey Fernandez is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname, that she has used since since she was young, she communicated with a cousin, and at least one friend, both of them from Noia, the town of Corua where she was born.
The messages are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the personal life that ABC reconstructs through her relatives' testimonials.
The young lady from Galicia, 30 years, initiated a relation in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
This affair lasted one year.
They decided to split, soon after they found out that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never allowed him to take the DNA test.
Soon after that she found someone else.
The man she chose was was Alberto, a man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She remained with him for a long period of time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to test the labour market, the child remained with her au pair that accompanied her for one week in Palma.
But in the content of her messages, one can see that their romance had ended, it was broken up.
In March 2008 in Menorca, single, she writes: "Alberto is very weird and upset, because I have come here to work."
"When I told him this he seemed to be happy, sure, but now he realizes how hard it is to stay with the child all day long and not to have the freedom of doing what he wants";
Then, she speaks of a message received on her mobile phone that reads: "I want you to come this month or give me an address to which I can send you the child."
She adds: "If he doesn't like leaving the child with my mother, I will take him when I get back."
In May, she speaks about her return to town: "I will go there this week, but I will only stay until the 19th, because on the 20th I must present myself at work."
She clarifies that if everything goes well, she will keep her first-born child.
"From now on he will stay with whom he must stay, meaning with me and I will never in my life leave him again with somebody else except for my mother" doubtful intention given her bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When she writes it, it is assumed that the boy, who arrived at the island on the 1st of that month, and supposedly was assassinated on 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is in contented on the one hand, but not on the other hand."
On the one hand he is with me and he likes the location, but on the other hand he is going to classes almost every day."
She speaks of a transfer to Mallorca.
"He will go to summer classes there, and thus I can save some money."
On the 17th, there are memories and complaints.
"Hugs from Caesar, who asked me when you'l come back."
"Alberto says that he sent I do not know what videos to the email and as you can see when he wants he can find me."
On the 30th, another one: "The boy is well; he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
About Victor, there is one: "He gives me money."
On the Internet there are messages of her in blogs dedicated to animation.
She even had one of her own in MySpace universe, where she called herself "Muki the ex prisoner."
"Terror of the Galician woman (inscription)."
The last man, who lived with her, declares his grief for feeling guilty.
He does not want to think that everything has happened for not having told him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered yesterday in the provincial prison of Palm, coming from the center of judicial prisoners of Menorca.
Carlos Maceda, the appointed lawyer, explained that he does not remember how the facts occurred, "nor that he had the intention to cause any minor pain."
