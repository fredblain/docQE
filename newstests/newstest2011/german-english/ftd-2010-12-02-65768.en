Ogoniland has burnt down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown and reeks like a petrol station. Billions of litres of leaked crude oil have destroyed the natural environment of Ogoniland in Nigeria.
People are living on theft, corruption and cooking illegal oil.
Celestine Akpobari sees the positive side.
"Don't worry," the ecoactivist tells journalists. "You'll see plenty of oil sludge to photograph today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian was trying to photograph a boy wading up to his waist in the water - and the streaks of water around him. In the rainbow-coloured water, the scene is almost beautiful.
The brown billows of crude oil under the surface are invisible.
Esther Badom used to fill buckets with shrimps at the bank of the Bodo jetty river.
Now, the stagnant waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, massive quantities of crude oil flooded out of a burst oil pipeline into the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to paddle six hours to get to water inhabited by fish. Ogoniland, in the heart of the Niger delta, is one of the most contaminated regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps, criss-crossed by river courses, the full extent of the devastation is plain to see.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat churns up a brown swill; if you put your hand in the water it comes out coated in oil.
The roots of the mangrove trees stick out from the ground like black liquorice sticks. The odd palm among the mangroves hangs its frond despondently.
The flocks of birds ubiquitous in wetlands are nowhere to be seen. As soon as the outboard motor falls silent, a devastating quiet descends over the former paradise that now stinks like a petrol station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari, sombrely. "We are living with a permanent hazard to health."
The comparison to war is apposite.
The region of the Ogoni has been a contested battlefield for decades. More than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe made their way to the region. In the 80s, the first wave of resistance was organised around the author Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was later executed. It was here that the Shell company had to stop production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is prohibited from returning to Ogoniland. While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped every day from the delta region as a whole - which is an area three times the size of Switzerland with more than 5000 wells and 7000 kilometres of pipeline - the oilfields in Ogoniland lie fallow, the situation too unstable for the oil company.
Every few hundred metres, steel frames rise from the water like bizarre sculptures. The heads of boreholes are far too affectionately referred to as "little Christmas trees."
These structures can be up to 50 years old and most of them are seriously corroded.
One borehole after the next falls apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have flown into the delta's ecosystem in 50 years. Year on year, that is the same amount of oil that rushed into the sea off Alaska when the Exxon Valdez supertanker crashed 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental catastrophes in human history.
There is dispute over who should be held responsible for the ongoing worst case scenario of ecological disaster.
Whilst the Shell company says sabotage and organised theft of oil are responsible for more than 90 percent of the contamination, environmentalists believe burst drill heads and leaking pipelines are the main cause.
In 2008, the US academic Richard Steiner accused Shell of applying significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than in the rest of the world. The rate of defects in pipelines alone was "several times higher than elsewhere."
Human figures emerge from the mangrove swamps, that from a distance look deserted, oil-covered outside garages. The figures are stark naked and covered to the neck in oil.
Under one of the many barrels - some connected to pipes, others scattered at random over the ground - there is a a flickering fire. An illegal mini refinery.
Michael, the group leader, explains that the crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours.
First, benzine is siphoned off to a collecting pan, then kerosene drips from the end of the tube and finally, diesel.
Michael and four assistants produce up to four 300-litre barrels of diesel a day in this way. "We get 34,000 naira for it" - about 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the delta use the chronic fuel shortage to their advantage in the largest crude oil state of sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has just one refinery of its own.
The illegal cooks can still undercut the absurdly low diesel prices of 40 Euro cents per litre. They get their raw material for nothing.
The material comes from "bunkerers" who tap the pipeline network all the way across Ogoniland. Over the entire Niger delta, experts estimate the country loses at least 16 millions litres of crude oil a day in this way.
However, only a tiny proportion of the raw material stored by bunkerers goes on to be refined illegally. Organised criminal networks with politicians and high-ranking officers amongst their ranks fill tankers with the lion's share and flog it on the global market.
The activist Akpobari believes the debate around whether the environmental catastrophe is the result of the activities of the population or lax production safety standards is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as interlopers and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen's livelihood, there would not be any sabotage, theft or illegal refineries."
Akpobari explains that the relationship between the Ogoni towards Shell in particular has been destroyed to such an extent that only withdrawal by the company is an option. "Perhaps other nations such as the Chinese will prove to be a better option."
Michael turns edgy.
"It's time you disappear," says the muscular oil man.
"The soldiers might turn up at any minute."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the army's task force, they are not likely to be jailed, but will have to pay hefty bribes.
It seems that the soldiers, who mainly originate from the north of the country, also want to profit from oil, like all other Nigerians.
"This damned stuff has brought our country to rock bottom in every way," says Akpobari.
