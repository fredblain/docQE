Investigators uncover dangerous defect in A380 engines
The A380, it seems, has a major safety issue.
During examination of a plane following an emergency landing, investigators have discovered a possible defect that could cause "catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas is now preparing to take the engine manufacturer to court.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that was forced to land at the beginning of November appear to have had considerably more luck than anyone realised. During its investigations, the Australian air safety authority identified a serious safety issue in the engines of some A380 planes - and is now warning of a possible construction defect.
The alleged defect would have serious consequences. In a statement published on Thursday, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) revealed that the defect could potentially cause fatigue cracks and leaks in an oil hose connection.
This could lead to "catastrophic engine failure."
20 different A380 aeroplanes with Rolls-Royce engines may be affected.
The Qantas Airbus that was forced to land in Singapore on 4 November was one of those aeroplanes.
The Australian airline is now taking legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It has submitted a claim to an Australian federal court in Sydney which leaves open further potential legal measures against the company.
The CEO of Qantas, Alan Joyce, said that his airline would demand compensation for the incident which occurred at the beginning of November.
The heat of the engine had caused parts to become detached and had damaged the wings.
Rolls-Royce believes an oil fire caused the damage.
Following the incident, up to 40 engines around the world must now be replaced.
The Australian investigators announced that they will be carrying out further safety tests on the superjumbos fitted with the affected engines.
ATSB speaker Martin Dolan said that the safety recommendation was the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce.
The safety issue was considered sufficiently serious for all affected parties to be informed.
After the forced landing of the Qantas plane, the airline grounded its A380 fleet for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily kept about three of its eleven A380 on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine in one A380 as a precaution.
The double-decker is the largest passenger plane in the world.
