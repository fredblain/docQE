Rubén Roman Omar counts with three defeats in the finals, having during his career ups and downs, but he knew how to reach in three occasions the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, in addition two different styles marked by their technicians' face, who find each other with a contrast marked by results.
Rubén Roman Omar counts with three defeats in the finals, having during his career ups and downs, but he knew how to reach on three occasions the decisive series, although until now he hadn't reached the target and this is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentinean has ended up being consoled with the medal of runner-up, and remained one step behind the winners and peculiarly with similar equipment he has played consecutive finals.
Santos arrived to his first final as trainer in the Opening Match of 2002, when he took the reins of Morelia with which he fell to 4-2 before Toluca; later, in the Closing Event of 2003 he also arrived at the decisive duel and he lost also it at 3-1 and indeed before Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the Bicentennial Match of 2010, again before Los Diablos, Rubén suffers again a reverse, since his team finished equally places 2-2 before the sausage makers after 210 minutes of game, but in the turn of penalties put himself in advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title but finally three players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the change 4-3.
Rubén already lost two finals with Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, its rival in turn, therefore he doesn't want to endure the same fate, he wants to celebrate a title for the first time, and he affirms that the most important thing for him is the institution.
I want be a champion, I do not want break any statistic, this is for a club, for a passion and consequently the title will come to me, but the previous thing is more important, commented the helmsman when being questioned about the numbers he has against by playing finals.
Very effective he has the previous final, from which, he assures, has learned much, " the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee signals the end we cannot celebrate, we prepare ourselves as well as the players because the previous time, with two penalties we were about to leave and I believe that is an lesson to be learned, we cannot celebrate until the game ends."
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty kicks, something that doesn't trouble him, because he trusts his players: " One should never looks for going to penalties, but rather to finish in regular time; sometimes you don't have any alternative and it is necessary to be ready; in the previous match we were prepared, unfortunately destiny played into our hands; sometimes by nerves or anxiety for having the title in out hands, but we didn't reach this goal, and this left us something for this final that we hope to win."
Roman should stop being a technical runner-up and tasting for the first time the glory that the titles give.
