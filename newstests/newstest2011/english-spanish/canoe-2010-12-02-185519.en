The king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Montreal resident of Algerian origin, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely individual programme.
The athlete, who excels at "sanda" ("full contact" kung-fu), at kickboxing and at Thai boxing, is entering the tatami and the rings of the world in search of fresh challanges.
"I started practising martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal who has lived in the capital since 2008 in order to train with professionals.
"In my case I look for fights everywhere, since for those who do not like the floor fights present in mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, the man working as security agent for the UPS company, had bad news for his rivals, having gained two gold medals in the amateur world championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh in Scotland.
"I won in the classes of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"Competitors who finished among the first four zt the preceding world championship in each class, were invited."
"In Toronto in 2009 I won the bronze medal."
"In Vietnam in 2005, I finished eigth."
"I finished fifth in the 2007 tournament in China and third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What is interesting is that I did better at each competition."
"At this rate I will be first this year, or next!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is an original Chinese contest, where punches and kicks, as well as throwing to the ground is authorised.
The fights take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous pugilist from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal is asked to recall only one event of his career, it will surely be his participation in the "King of Sanda" tournament in the kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the most often mentioned and the most prestigious in China," explained the agreeable, strapping young man.
"It is the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium, (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a super experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, a semi-final in his class (80 kg), before losing in the finals.
"The man who beat me was a real professional" he analysed.
"There are four fighters in each class (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg) "
"The winners of the semi-finals fight one another in the finals of their class."
"The winners in each class fight one another for the title of a sigle champion, the king of kung-fu."
