Rivers under close surveillance
Several water courses continue to be under close surveillance due to the heavy rains falling in several regions of the province since Tuesday
A land slide occurred on Wednesday afternoon at Shawinigan in Mauritia.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening another land slide occurred at Saint-Lin-Laurentides in Lenaudière.
A road collapsed.
Between Tuesday and Wednesday evening heavy rain (from 40 to 70 millimetres) fell in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimetres of additional rain were expected between now and Thursday evening depending on region.
Sectors north of the river and in Outaouais alley were worst affected.
They received a total of up to 100 millimetres of rain.
Since these falls will be added to the thawing of snow already lying in certain sectors, the overflowing of several rivers is feared.
Flood alerts were issued on Wednesday evening by Quebec Civil Security for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in Lenaudière.
The rivers Nord in Saint Jerôme, in the Laurentides and Chène in Lotbinière were the object of flood warnings and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rains caused the overflowing of certain lakes at Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as at Rawdon.
At Sainte-Calixte, a provisional bridge was swept away by heavy rains.
Ten dwellings had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In the Outaouais, the overflowing of certain lakes entailed the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Annik Bouchard, a security consultant, stated that Civil Security continued to be in a state of alert and was monitoring the situation closely.
On Wednesday, Quebec Flood Forecast Centre issued flood warnings in respect of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, L'Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
