The new unity does not create unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible creation of a permanent unit for combating corruption and collusion, numerous observers continue to demand the creation of a commission of public inquiry into the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robrt Dutil, asserts that this idea is not new: Quebec consulted the New York Department of Investigation on the subject last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Nevertheless, the Tuesday announcement surprised more than one person.
It must be said that at a mmeeting of the Quebec permanent police council last 29 October this step was never discussed, notwithstanding the presence of Robert Dutil.
It did not need any more than that the public security critic Stephane Bergeron should call this announcement a "rabbit produced out of the hat" and as "a solution thrown together on the corner of a table"
Minister Dutil replied to those fearing that political power would have too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You will see the result when it is announced, he contented himself with affirming."
"One is aware of that problem."
As far as the president of the CSQ, RÃ©jean Parent is concerned, nothing can replace the launch of a public inquiry.
"The more obstinately M.Charest refuses to create this commission of inquiry, the more people will think like you and I that there is something to be hidden," he explains.
"The only way to get a commission of inquiry is for Jean Charest to resign" explains Yves Boisvert, Professor of Ethics and Government at the Ecole Nationale d'Administration Publique
In order to get out of this impasse he therefore suggests that Quebec should give a special mandate to the General Verifier for the latter to inquire into collusion and corruption.
"One must be able to broaden the mandate of the General Verifier," he decides.
He also feels that Quebec could confer on the Verifier the same powers as those of a commissioner, allowing the former to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent group of people is not the only project on the Charest government programme.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to modify the criminal code, to make it more suitable for this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that precedent is not explicit on this type of inquiry.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews confirmed that his colleague at Justice, Rob Nicholson is currently inclined to introduce certain amendments.
At the time of the Spring 2001 operation, which targeted groups of motor cyclists, even though the criminal code had not been adapted, 181 persons were arrested..
Ottawa subsequently ruled to adopt the law on gangsterism
