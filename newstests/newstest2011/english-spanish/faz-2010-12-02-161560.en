400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu corporation is relocating its Bad Homburg office to Frankfurt.
In July of next year, 400 employees will move from the current office building on Marienbad Square in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt's Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu corporation is relocating its Bad Homburg office to Frankfurt.
The industry giant in computers and computer maintenance announced on Wednesday that 400 men and women are to move from the current office building on Marienbad Square in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt's Astro Park in July of next year. The Astro Park is a large office complex on Lyon Street in Frankfurt's Niederrad district.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, a further 100 corporation employees currently spread across the region will join the Frankfurt office.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive and the open-plan office in the Astro Park was better suited to the way employees actually work, the spokeswoman added.
Fujitsu had also only been renting the office in Bad Homburg.
The manager responsible for the move, Bernd Wagner, said, "in Frankfurt Niederrad, we have found a central location with outstanding infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport was of particular significance to a global company such as Fujitsu, he added.
Yesterday the coming relocation of an important company within the region was a cause for joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Markus Frank (CDU), head of Frankfurt's department of economic affairs, said the city had once again attracted a global player,
which was a "fantastic acknowledgement of the city."
He believed the city would suit Fujitsu and that the move would be a significant boost for Niederrad.
Michael Korwisi (Greens), Mayor of Bad Homburg, expressed his regret at Fujitsu's decision.
He said the city had been informed of the intended move by the company's management board well in advance.
"We offered the company our help, as a matter of course," said Korwisi.
The amicable meetings, however, had no effect on the difficulties between the computer manufacturer and the landlord for the property on Marienbad Square.
Economic reasons had finally tipped the balance.
Korwisi now wants to focus on preventing such a prominent location from remaining vacant long-term.
"I hope the building's owner and landlord will cooperate."
The building previously used by Fujitsu on the town hall square and the neighbouring low-rise "Kleine Vertikale" were among a number of buildings on Marienbad Square that were part of the controversial building project by the spa town ten years ago.
The joint project between the city and a private project developer served to create a new entrance into the city between the train station and town hall, which attracted criticism on account of the massive scale of development over areas previously partly used for parking, and on account of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, three companies moved in: Feri, the investment consultancy management and rating company, Start Amadeus, the travel sales and marketing systems software manufacturer, and Fujitsu, the computer maker (still linked to Siemens at the time).
The buildings used by Fujitsu were purchased in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based DIC Group and the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold on to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid one year later.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu corporation sells itself as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies with computers, servers and other equipment and provides necessary servicing.
The office in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, although Fujitsu has considerably more employees in Munich.
The Fujitsu subsidiary, Technology Solutions, is also moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt; two further subsidiaries, Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS, will also be based in Frankfurt.
7000 square metres have been rented in the Astro Park office building to accommodate them.
The twenty-year-old complex - its name inspired by the star-shaped ground plan - is already home to the Central Association of the German Electrical and Electronics Industry (ZVEI) and other organisations.
