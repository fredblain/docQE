The veil lifted on a complex Canada....
The new American diplomatic cables divulged by Wikileaks have lifted the veil on what the United States consider to be an inferiority complex of Canadians towards Americans, but they also betray a superiority complex of the later towards Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are astonished that every Canadian elector does not have Canado-American relations at heart when voting and believe that the visit by President Obama helped the Conservative government to have its 2009 budget adopted!
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington published yesterday, give more spicy details to get one's teeth into.
A cable dated 22 Setember 2008, in the very middle of the federal election campaign, tells to what extent the United States form part of the stakes being debated by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations of this situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex is perhaps inducing Canadian political leaders to speak about everyday internal stakes, rather than blame this election on the United States (as during the free exchange campaign of 1988).
The United States therefore are, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to be talked about."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less, since the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically," he feels, "the ability of a candidate, of a party and even more of a party leader to mamage this essential relationship must be a key factor, which the voters have in mind when voting."
The other expression of this important sentiment is found in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, charg√© d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure the government's survival of the vote of confidence at the start of February on the federal budget, which will post Canada's first deficit for over ten years due to a relaunch plan of 30 to 40 thousand million dollars," writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere can be found any mention that the government had to adjourn parliament before Christmas to avoid being defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed relaunch plan.
Another communication dated Janaury 2008 and signed by ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington about the increasingly negative image of the United States conveyed by drama series broadcasts by CBC.
The ambassador is worried by broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligece and H2O, which contain unsubtle references to Maher Arar, to the "No Fly List" or again to kidnappings for rigorous interrogation by the CIA.
Another cable tells that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French opposite number Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe was ready to receive certain Guantanamo prisoners.
M. Kouchner replied "yes," but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, he wrote,"he handed a paper to the Secretary of State on the subject of Omar Khadr, a Moslem aged 15 of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the case."
It should be noted in conclusion that tempers became heated about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, declared on CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "asassinated."
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
