Let's get out of here
This evening, everything is finally going well for the Irish.
Not a trace of unhappiness.
The home team is dominating its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much for that.
The fans are hooting for joy against a soundtrack of blaring music and stamping feet.
The Bailey Pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is rocking because the table tennis players are throwing ping pong balls into beer glasses over a three metre distance - and scoring.
"Beer pong" is the name of the bizarre spectacle; the winner gets 500 Euros win bonus plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill drinking game and the reticent computer scientist do not really go together.
But the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself by playing, to distract from the burning question of what the future will bring.
He has not scheduled in a round of gambling in Las Vegas - he will be taking part in job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a weird feeling doing it," he says.
"It is so far from home and I still don't have any work there."
Still, his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - "she got her dream job as event manager in no time - perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
In response to the poor outlook at home, two of Tanner's three siblings are already taking their chances abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney and his brother Colin has got a job as an IT consultant in London.
Young people are leaving. Tanner's family is hardly the exception for families on the island.
100,000 Irish men and women will leave the country in the near future, predict experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Dublin.
By 2015, they estimate a total of 200,000 emigrants.
For a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, that will be a significant loss.
If the predictions prove to be correct, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to the emigration Ireland suffered in the 80s.
After a decade of growth that brought great prosperity for the Irish with it, the hard times have returned.
The economic crisis is particularly bewildering for young, well-educated Irish who have only seen things getting better.
Job losses and social descent seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed and there was money abounding.
Since then, three out of every ten men and women under thirty are without work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from young emigrants complaining that "everything is going down the pan in Ireland."
"There should be a revolution against the politicians and bankers - but anyone who can simply leaves and our country is losing an entire generation."
"Can the last person please turn out the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Union of Students, sees a dismal future ahead, because the government is engaged in window-dressing and is no longer offering young people prospects for the future.
"They are reducing the minimum wage, but they don't have a strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She sees her fellow students making their way from one unpaid internship to another.
Her greatest concern is that she will have to emigrate in four years as well.
"The thought is sad and depressing."
On the other hand, men such as Stephen McLarnon try to give the situation a positive spin.
McLarnon organises the WorkingAbroadExpo, a fair offering an all-round service for work abroad.
"For people starting a career, working abroad is a great chance to take your first steps onto the career ladder," says the manager.
There are photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada on his website.
The message is clear. Working abroad is not galley duty, but a source of freedom and fun.
For the last six months, Se√°n O'Donovan has known what it feels like to build something somewhere else.
As there was nothing more for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on building sites in Germany.
They are currently working on a fashion boutique in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, they will move on to Hanover or Berlin - to the next project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan visits his home country seldom, as he is taking on extra shifts to be able to pay off the mortgage on his house at home.
"The situation is really a bit crazy," he says, as he goes through the door of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I am earning money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I barely see."
He laughs a little self-consciously and wanders through the cold rooms.
The small house is in a classy neighbourhood with tended front gardens. Large, expensive cars are parked in the driveways.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 Euros - financed with a 100 percent mortgage.
"They were mad times - there was easy money without too many questions," he says.
Is he worried that things could go wrong with the mortgage?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours some more tea and says: "I don't have any children to feed and I am young. Even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The civil engineer does not like the moaning that he hears so often.
"No one has to starve - out situation is nowhere near as dramatic as times this island has gone through in the past," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst that can happen - perhaps we only really feel Irish by going abroad."
He laughs and recalls how his father went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"Seven years later, he was back and life went on in Ireland, just like that."
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Leave the future open and just see what it is like living somewhere else.
He has already spent a few years working in London and why should things not go well for him and his girlfriendin New Zealand?
One thing still worries him well and truly these days - the party for his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He worries it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"Just not too much emotion," he says and drinks a large gulp of beer.
"Farewell - that sounds alarming."
"Lets just call it a going away party, really relaxed with a few friends, a couple of drinks and the odd game."
