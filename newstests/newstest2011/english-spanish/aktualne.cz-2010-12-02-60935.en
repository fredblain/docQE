Offices need a kindergarten nearby, architects have understood
Avriopoint Office Building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design Company.
Nobody would expect that it contains a tiny kindergarten with everything necessary - with colored walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature golf course on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year the children of Arch.Design employees can attend.
Architectural design company, Arch.Design, whose studios produced a number of important buildings in Brno, have included the space for their corporate tiny kindergarten even in the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It indeed employs nearly 90 people - mainly baby-boom-aged and they want their female designers and architects to quickly return to work.
Along with the possibility of part-time contracts the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to their employees within their welfare program.
Female construction engineers and architects have thus the opportunity to combine their demanding jobs with child care.
Tinz kindergarten has been invented by Arch. Design employees themselves and with the support from management they were able to obtain a grant of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Corporate tiny kindergarten is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Program Human Resources and Employment and state budget of CZ.
Thanks to grant funding (subsidy of 2.8 million) they were able to purchase equipment and for the period of two years provide qualified personnel and operation.
After the depletion of financial aid (2 years) the Arch.Design Company must operate the kindergarten for 3 years at its own expense.
Preparation of the project lasted one year and the Economy Rating Company helped with the applications for grant significantly.
The care is provided by qualified staff, children are taken care of by a nurse and a kindergarten teacher all day; the kindergarten can therefore be attended by children without any age restrictions, but most of them are over 3 years old.
As this is a "Mini-kindergarten," only 5 children may be present at the same time, even though more can attend in the course of the day altogether.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the position in the company hierarchy.
Although this is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is comparable with the framework program of preschool education.
Children are not only playing here, they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for schooling and English is also taught here.
The class is not only equipped with toys, inspiring games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can always check their child and it prevents stress situations related to delayed pick-up from nurseries located far from their parents" workplace.
Parents then use the working time much more efficiently.
Not surprisingly, a loyal employee - employer relationship is produced there naturally.
Arch.Design became one of the Czech companies, which offer significant benefit when recruiting new employees, they are friendly to the family and through this program they have enhanced personnel marketing.
