The Pakistani nuclear program generates great restlessness in the USA
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a rate faster than any other country."
The filtrations of Wikileaks confirm the bonds between the Taliban people and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State of the USA filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous restlessness which the Pakistani nuclear program brings about in Washington.
Besides the enlightening and substantial details that are offered on the content of the conversations and the thoughts of the credited North American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between both countries in the matter of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons with "a rhythm faster than any other country."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the arms are not assembled but they remain stored by components to make difficult their destruction in case of attack-- it constitutes one of the main causes for concern in Washington.
Thus is enumerated by the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report previous to the visit of the ex- advisor of National Security, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear power plants on the territory under Taliban attack, the rumoured dispersion of the nuclear materials and the vulnerability of atomic materials transportation."
The high number of people implied in the nuclear arsenals and the missiles programs is being taken into consideration, not only by the USA, but also by Russia, such as the reason for maintaining its guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs in order to protect the nuclear power plants; given the poor educative and cultural levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in the nuclear programs or of missiles," said the expert Yuri Carole, from the Russian Ministry of External Affairs, in a meeting with his Americans homologous.
The newest information on the documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is the decreasing cooperation between the USA and Pakistan in subjects of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani rate of nuclear weapon production.
An office of the embassy in May, that describes as "frustrating" the communication with Pakistan, says that: "The transparency is frequently nonexistent; the offers of aid remain without an answer or are refused."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, civil servant of the National Intelligence for the south of Asia, states that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons in a rhythm faster than any other country of the world."
The ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit of the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to give clear orders to the person in charge that "the Army of Pakistan must end the tacit support to the terrorist groups."
