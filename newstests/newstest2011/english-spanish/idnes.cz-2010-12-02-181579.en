How to choose the mattress and the slatted bed base: Women have different requirements from men
Not luxurious bed frame, but the quality of the lying area, that is the mattress and slatted bed base gives a really good bed.
They must however match in a harmonious way to suit a specific user.
The selection decisions are influenced by lots of things such as the weight, height, age, health, and gender of the owner.
Also the type of interior, into which the mattress and slatted base are purchased, is important.
A typical example?
For instance for summer houses which are not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not suitable because they warm up rather slowly.
In addition, they tend to have significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane foam mattress.
It is also necessary to turn them regularly.
If they do not have enough venting channels in their core, and still lie on a hard board, they retain moisture: Even mold could occur beneath the mattresses.
The choice is also influenced by habits.
Who spent more time abroad, where they often use very thick mattresses with softening layer, they will find it hard to feel good on a thin one with hard surface.
"Perhaps all hockey players returning from the NHL complained to me that they were sleepless."
"Their battered shoulders, heels and hips needed the mattress to be softened with a layer of lazy foam."
"Those are recommended even for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they assume 'information' from the joints and skin in an ill way," explains Sylvia Hadamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
She therefore looked for lazy foam mattresses for many hockey players, but also other customers years ago.
"Now it's okay, suitable mattresses can be found at Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You need not be an NHL guy to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "miracle" works in a simple manner.
Optimizes its rigidity and shape by the heat absorbed or adapts to your body warm.
You feel no press and will not keep changing position on your bed all night as if you were after a tough game.
You will just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works well as a protection against pressure sores.
When choosing the size of your mattress thickness, add one foot length to your height, which is about 21-34 cm.
Man and woman with a height of about 180 cm then need a bed of 210-220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90cm in double bed, i.e. 180 cm altogether.
In separate beds, for example for singles, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
For both usual comfort and a possible visitor.
"Otherwise the rule for bed width is simple: when lying on your back, you should keep your hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopov√°, head of the Guild of upholsterers and decorators, who has addressed the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for many years and teaches it to colleges.
For everyone needs their own mattress and a slatted base in a double bed, be careful to buy match the thickness of mattresses when buying them.
Otherwise you will have to fit into slatted bases into different heights, which may not be possible with every frame of the bed.
Foam mattress should be at least 14 cm, while the frame types with a spring framework should be at least 15 cm, including at least three centimeters count for the shaping and softening layer.
"You must not feel the springs when touching the mattress with hands or sitting down on the mattress," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a certain type of slatted base.
Upholstered beds, where the mattress and the foundation are like conjoined Siamese twins, should not appear in bedrooms.
It is hard to air the mattresses; you can not wash the fabric either, which should be a must today.
And since we normally perspire 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat during the night, it is obvious that after five to seven years the mattress will resemble a large (and clogged) sieve.
That's why experts refuse advertising slogans of life of the mattress up to 25 years, or even a lifetime warranty.
Everything has its pros and cons.
Therefore, the practical advice from vendors is as follows: Do not give up hygiene for mattresses with a width of 120 and 140 cm and their removable and washable cover, rather add a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Although today mattress covers are now commonly manufactured with a zip around the perimeter, so after opening you get two parts (vital for washing and the size of washing machine!), handling the larger types when removing them (and in one person) may remind of a match of light-weight fightnig a heavy one in the ring.
Do you have a fixed plate in the bed instead of a slatted base?
Never!
If so, then only in a bed for one-night visitors.
The board should nevertheless be equipped (if not already) with ventilation holes and use the mattress with spring framework of a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in the bags (from German Taschenfederkern) and a softening layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be on such a basis.
For non-positioning slats with 14-18 blades, latex or sandwich mattresses will be suitable (maybe a combination of latex and coconut), but it always pays back to get the slatted bases with larger number of blades, 28 or more, where there are double blades in the lumbar area and their stiffness can be regulated.
Mattresses with spring frames should not lie on adjustable slats as they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of slats you can also enjoy the so-called shoulder cradle.
This is a special mounting of blades, which enables to push, or even tilt the plate so that the arm of the sleeper would nicely "fit into the mattress."
For men whose shoulders are "all over their back," this is certainly an important thing.
Even mattress manufacturers respect it when in "men" mattresses they began to use the softening zone right in the shoulder area.
They also remember the women - those indulge in the softer surface of the hip area.
Aileron or lamellar gratings with the so-called multi-torsion suspension are intended for the most demanding customers.
The pressure is spread into several points and the tension reduces.
But be careful when you use a wrong pillow with a correct mattress and slatted base (large and "stuffed"), most of the "pluses" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: The cushion should support the head and touch the shoulders with its corners so that the shoulder muscles could relax.
A suitable size of 50 x 60 cmis recommended, preferred for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be able to deal (along with the shoulder cradle of the slatted bed or softened zone in the mattress) with shoulder height.
Modern mattresses do have something in common with original mattresses filled with grasses.
Their manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least admixtures.
There is simply an organic trend even in mattresses.
Raw materials from oil, out of which polyurethane foam is made, are being replaced with natural oils, such as from soy and castor-oil plant.
It is just soy that all well-known manufacturers use now.
"Organic in mattresses means that the core is made of purely natural material," explains Petr Vasicek from the company Tropico Plus.
Natural products are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in microcapsules that can release fresh scent of lavender or forest.
There is even a division for men and women.
While men are "cooled" by herbal extract of birch, so that the mattress cover would absorb heat and cool the body, women are on the contrary "warmed" by the covers.
The extract of red pepper increases circulation of blood, so the weaker sex feels warmer.
Today's favorites?
Mattress made of cold foam (with larger pores with a damaged cell structure is more breathable than regular polyurethane and has a better elasticity.
Combining different stiffnesses of cold foams and "lazy" foam result in multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head should be, as well as shoulders and heels.
You will pay seven thousand crowns and above for a good quality mattress.
Those that meet health parameters tend to have lower rate of VAT as they are considered medical equipment.
Gumotex was the first to employ this advantage in the Czech Republic.
It is not easy to save on the mattress and the slatted base.
Sometimes you can use special offers of manufacturers or retailers, who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For instance Magniflex brand offers their Duofreeze mattress with the memory foam Memory sewn into the cover for 11 990 crowns.
However, you can get the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density was started by Tempur material in a "cosmic" pace.
It was originally developed as a material for NASA because the astronauts were exposed to enormous overextertion during the start.
Tempur softens when warm, but strengthens in the cold.
It is then perfectly adapted to warm human body and spreads its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal to prevent pressure ulcer development, but also to enhance comfort while sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also medical products, such as special pillows under the feet, which mitigate the legs and venous system.
Domestic producers use the foam Twinsaver or Eucatherm C and such.
