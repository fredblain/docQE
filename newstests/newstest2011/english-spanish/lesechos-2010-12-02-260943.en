World championships 2018-2022: Fifa appoints organising countries.
Torment due to suspected corruption. On Thursday, the executive committee of Fifa will appoint countries to organise World Cup matches in 2018 and 2022, an eminently politcal choice, where influence and lobbying battles are liable to take precedence of technical criteria.
One thing is certain; the 2018 edition of the Fifa competition will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of the game (4 candidates, Great Britain, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Belgium-The Netherlands; Angleterre, Russie, Espagne-Portugal, Pays-Bas-Belgique).
That of 2022 will be a lot more exotic, Fifa hoping to conquer new territories (Quatar, Australia) after a first contest on the African continent in 2010 or to pursue its introduction into the USA, or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities of the delegations (David Cameron, Price William, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of the Belgian and Dutch governments, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) give an idea of the economic and political stakes of a world competition.
Behind-the-scenes bargaining may therefore last up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to a Fifa assessment report, the British, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) cases advance better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily with the 22 members of the executive committee, when it comes to voting.
The Sunday Times whiose disclosures resulted in the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temerii and Amos Adamu), might thus have ruined the chances of its country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
On Monday the BBC broadcast a documentary concerning three influential members of the executive committee, Ricardo Teizeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Upsetting Fifa and embarrasing the British representatives, who engaged in intensive lobbying in recent weeks, mainly through David Beckham.
The head of the British government hopes to repeat the coup of his predessesor Tony Blair, who in 2005 secured the choice of London as the venue of the 2012 Olympic Games.
Will this intensive activity suffice to reguild the shield of England in the eyes of the executive committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack for advantages, with its stadia already completed, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the sombre economic and financial prospects of the two countries could pour cold water on their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the British and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal can only improve the standing of Russia, which has become a powerful outsider, despite its lacks (stadia, hotels, transport).
But the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of voting" in a veiled reference to accusations in the British Press against members of the executive committee.
"They are being spattered with mud and attempts are being made to compromise them," alleged Mr. Putin.
Concerning 2022, the United States with expereince of 1994, appear the obvious favourites.
The leading world ecomomic power, the seat of the principal sponsors of Fifa, the country appears to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea who have separately built a very fine project.
But these new candidatures appear premature for two countries, which jointly organised the 2002 trial.
Another threat: The award of the 2026 World Competition to China, ardently desired by Fifa, which will in fact extinguish Asian chances for 2022.
Concerning Qatar which has made great play of proposing futuristic stadia and Australia, Fifa would pursue its expansion into new regions, but these two countries offer more risk than certainty.
Like Japan and South Korea, Australia could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights of European countries, the nerve centre of the war for Fifa.
