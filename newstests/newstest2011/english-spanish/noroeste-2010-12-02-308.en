NASA will announce the discovery extraterrestrial life
The American space agency called the press tomorrow to present a discovery that will cause impact in the search of living beings in the space.
The National Administration for Space and Aeronautics (NASA) of the United States will present tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, that could prove the theory that there is extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 PM at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology; a science described as the one that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of the life in the Universe.
When calling the press, NASA assured that it will present "a discovery that will cause impact in the search of extraterrestrial life," which provoked speculation by experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures that look like us living in hostile spaces that are thought of as uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility that they become intelligent beings like humans if they improve their living conditions.
Apparently it is centred around a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Monkey Lake in the National Park Yosemite, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a means of survival and out of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist in other planets that do not have our benevolent environment.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that "indeed there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will present the full extent of the discoveries in the press conference of tomorrow Thursday.
Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life in Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the greater Saturn moon), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to the one of the Earth will both attend the conference.
