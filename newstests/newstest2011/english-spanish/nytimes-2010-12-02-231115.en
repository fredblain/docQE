Tech Toys to Keep Your Gift Budget in Balance
While the leading candidate for this year's most marvelous toy is the iPad, followed by, perhaps, a Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can put a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five $99 BMX bicycles, and that one Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic beaded jump ropes, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club - to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been at work; this year's technology toy is likely to have more power, while costing the same if not a bit less compared with last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated Web sites, two of the most well known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offerings.
And button-cell powered toys are increasing, as well as toys with rechargable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, except if otherwise noted.) 
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for ages 3 and up) are guinea pig-sized plush toys that sing a note when you squeeze their bellies.
One squeeze equals one note, and a second squeeze starts building a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for ages 2 and up) is the best choice.
Borrowing on last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-taking games like Simon Says, and can moon walk, thanks to his innovative hinged feet with locking wheels.
Children testing the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor although their parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you may recall Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for ages 3 and up), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correcting, wisecracking workbook.
If you're leery of handing your child your smartphone, here are three stand-alone alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard, although the games don't teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, for ages 3 to 12), Leapfrog's first major overhaul of the Leapster line, with a newer, brighter screen.
Neither version is compatible with older cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to deliver games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that makes it possible to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a set of five blocks just larger than a book of matches, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to make words by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; it's great for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have some sort of online connection.
Based on their presence in toy stores alone, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet in Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for ages 6 to 12) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child is given enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
These might include roller skates or a pet Puffle toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle-end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for ages 5 and up) is the latest in a line of button-cell powered micro-robots.
The faux bug moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicon legs, in random directions.
It is fun to make a maze out of blocks to see if it can find its way through.
It's durable, too.
Ours was able to drop off the kitchen table and even spent some time inside our dog's mouth.
