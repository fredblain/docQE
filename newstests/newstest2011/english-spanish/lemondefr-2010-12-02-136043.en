Ivory Coast is nervously expecting the announcement of the election results.
The UNO Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election, on the expiry of the set period.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay" stressed a spokesman for the head of UNO."
"He asks all Ivory Coast parties and institutions to show responsibility and to abstain from any initiatives pending the annoucement of the provisional results."
Despite pressures exerted by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed th target date of Wednesday midnight to pass, without publishing the results three days after the Sunday voting.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the set period the president of the independent electoral commission "continued to work" on the announbcement of the results.
Throughout the world, calls became more frequent on Wednesday for the electoral commission finally to declare the name of the winner of the second round, Laurent Gbagbo or his opponenent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting ont he cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, received by the ex-rebels of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Buessan, campaign director of the Ivory Coast president, stated that the manœeuvres of intimidation of electors by the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded the partisans of the leaving president from voting.
Any election could be annulled, if complaints by Ghagbo are accepted by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's enemies allege that the highest Court of the coutry is not impartial, since it is presided by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man from the north, who denies any links with the ex-rebels, has described as "unacceptable" the delay in making the announcement of the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies state that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, because he knows that he lost and that complaining to the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from publishing the results, would be illegal.
The second round of voting in the presidential election on Sunday was thought to have crowned the process of reunification and of reconciliation of a country split in two for years.
On Wednesday UNO warned the Ivory Coast political class that it might be held respoonsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished at the top in the first round on 11 October, with 38% of votes against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of the former presdient Henri Konan Bedié (25% in the firts round).
