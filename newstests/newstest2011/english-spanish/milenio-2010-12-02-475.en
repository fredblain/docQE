Bounded to the legality expulsion of Espino: Caesar Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the ex-baker leader is within his right to go to the Commission of National Order to protest according to his rights.
The national leader of the PAN, Caesar Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was become attached to the legality and that the ex- leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to protest according to his rights.
In a previous interview to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that anyway the expulsion of Espino is a decision made in the local area.
"It is about an independent decision by the Commission of the Order of Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to go, where appropriate, via a claim made to the Commission of Order of the National Council, being a decision taken in the scope of an authorized organ," he wrote.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that never was there in the negotiation table an alliance for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that the National Action will get fortified in the internal election of 4th and 5th of December, where will be chosen his successor."
This (an alliance in the 2012) is a subject that was never discussed at the negotiation table, or at least not thus far, it was an exposition for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the objective," he referred to.
The leader underlined that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, the reason why "we are not afraid of the internal competition; on the contrary "we enjoy it and makes us stronger."
He said that without any doubt that the council will know how to choose the best leader than the National Action would require for the next three years, for that reason he will give the office "to whom the council chooses."
"I have that absolute tranquillity and openness; to anyone of the five I would be proud to give the office of the president of party."
He foretold that the rise the party registered during the past elections on the 4th July will be reflected in the next fights, although "it is not the time yet for thinking about 2012."
"So far it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this duty."
In this framework, it stood out that the three governments of alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the reason for observation in the entire country, for that reason "many hopes, yearnings are put in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be equal to the challenges."
While being interrogated on the critics of the PRI to President Felipe Calderón for his speech within the framework of the four years of his government, Cesar Nava asked the PRI members to reflect on the 6 years terms of the former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; they should begin defending them; and leave the closet, he affirmed.
He considered that the holder of the federal Executive can say expressions as the ones he said during his speech in the National Audience, because in the country there is no gag or censure.
