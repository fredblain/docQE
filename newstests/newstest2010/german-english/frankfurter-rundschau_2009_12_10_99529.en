Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories international.
Professors of Toronto University are on it, as are those from the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna and Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are included, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The vacation by the police of the Casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University is having repercussions throughout the world.
278 professors and teaching assistants of the Goethe University, but also of colleges from all over Germany, Europe and North and South America are showing their solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in both German and English, they "condemn" the police action initiated by the executive committee.
University president Werner Müller-Estler had the building seized by students and assistant professors on strike last week, because walls and objects of art had been besmirched.
Five students were hurt in the action.
The material damage, the signatories argue, does not justify "the forceful dissolution of self-organised courses of students and lecturers by a police commando unit".
The vacation represents "an inacceptable infringement" on the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "to deligitimise and criminalise the protest" and distracts from the matter.
The executive committee has refused to enter into the necessary discourse.
The teaching staff demand the immediate termination of the criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, read the statement.
Protest legitimised
The youth ranks of the Verdi Union and the German Association of Unions are also showing their solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for their own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hesse's Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), however, supported the approach of the university president and police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are absolutely inacceptable means, the said in a topical session on Thursday in the Wiesbaden parliament.
We have sympathy for the protest, but cannot accept vandalism, said the CDU parliament member Peter Beuth.
A different stance was taken by the opposition parties - the SPD, Greens and Left Party.
The CDU is taking besmirched walls as the pretext to criminalise the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left Party).
Instead of taking the students' arguments and students seriously, they organised this vacation.
The Left Party has filed an application calling on the Minister of Internal Affairs to report on the police action.
