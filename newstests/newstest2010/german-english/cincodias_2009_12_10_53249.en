FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer-long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia for 64.5 million euros.
The firm received this contract days after getting Bosruck's (Austria) tunnel expansion job.
By doing this, Alpine is strengthening its expertise in tunnel construction.
The construction is planned to start in the beginning of 2010, and the project timeframe will span 32 months.
