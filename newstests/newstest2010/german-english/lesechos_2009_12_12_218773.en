At Normale Supérieure (one of France's top schools), experts have 15 minutes to change opinions on climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about what is at stake at the Copenhagen summit: that was the challenge taken up on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the intergovernmental group of Climate Evolution experts (GIEC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure in rue d'Ulm (Paris).
Jean Jouzel, Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the conferences entitled "Ernest", a day composed of a series of 15-minute lectures from experts, filmed and open to the public, noted an AFP reporter.
We wanted to do something to catch people's attention and make them want to find out more, explained one of the day's organisers, 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, outside the conference; this having been named after the name given to the fish in the school's pond.
We choose around twenty lecturers among the experts in their field and the more charismatic ones are selected, he added.
On the subject of global warming, "we could go on for hours, but we can also cover the key objectives in a few minutes", Jean Jouzel told the AFP, who made his presentation without notes, but with graphical aids, to an audience of around fifty.
This is part of our scientist's role, he emphasised, hoping that listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely solid scientific case".
The video footage from the conferences will be available online on the school's website starting the 15th of December.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February, followed by others on a bimonthly basis.
