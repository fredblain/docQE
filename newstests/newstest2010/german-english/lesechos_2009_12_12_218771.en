Late payments: anger from prison guards, action planned
Prison guard unions called for a "general rally" on Friday to demand payment of their bonuses and overtime before the end of the year holidays, having seen it pushed into January for budgetary reasons.
FO-pénitentiaire (2nd prison guard union) has requested that staff, who are not on duty, demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of prison buildings and to "block" them, in order to "expose the theft of their earnings".
The CGT-pénitentiaire (3rd union in the profession) calls for them to "unite in general, rallying at the various prisons, to show a strong turn-out", condemn the non-payment of "overtime, night-shift bonuses, Sunday and holiday pay" in December for their work in October as "shameful and unacceptable".
And the first prison guard union, Union fédérale autonome pénitentiaire (UFAP/UNSA), "calls for general rallying (…) to re-awaken the discontent and anger".
The penitentiary administration's Management and the Justice Ministry explain that overtime has increased considerably in 2009 and was not fully covered in the budget, but assures that the outstanding balances will be settled in January.
The Chancery stated near the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a communication to the prison guard unions guaranteeing the payment would be made next month.
I am not ignoring the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this communication.
I have asked the penitentiary administration Management to put in place, without delay, a set of measures to ensure that this situation, caused by a poor evaluation of the number of additional work hours, does not repeat itself in the future, adds Mrs. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay packet will therefore be slim, except for management staff, who benefit from the so-called target and position-related bonuses, critics the UFAP/UNSA, saying "budgetary constraints are a convenient excuse".
It is an absolute scandal, complains the inter-regional union from Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott "all meetings and convocations" until further notice.
Staff will not be putting in Sunday or holiday hours if the October ones are not settled in December, and the same goes for overtime, threatens the Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne trade union.
At a time when our goals and responsibilities are being expanded, but our staff numbers are not, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's salaries, judges the CGT-pénitentiaire de Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, with some being worse off than others.
But in any case, the balance is not there, observes Jean-François Forget, general secretary of UFAP.
