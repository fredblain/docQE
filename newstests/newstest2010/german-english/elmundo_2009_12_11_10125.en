General Motors delays Opel plan until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April -probably the 8th- as reported by Javier Ortega, the U.S. manufacturer is cautioning that more time is needed to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants each of the points of the new plan to have the prior approval of the affected party.
And this may make the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is making sure that a decision regarding the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is not strange that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having had contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which aims to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is funded by the Russian group Converg, is gaining momentum.
In the event that none of them come to an agreement, GM would be able to sell some Saab assets to the Chinese Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold still stands.
