Fall-out over the budget. ODS attacks Fischer, who defends himself
The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, described the next year's approved budget as "terrible" and said that Premier Jan Fischer's government should seriously rethink its position in office.
The government chairman described the ODS statement as strong words.
Apparently he will take some time to think about it.
The vice-chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, said that the concept of an interim government supported by the ČSSD, ODS, and Green Party, was evidently no longer working.
According to Nečas, the government chairman must decide if he intends to fall back on the minority in the House as a fight against the growing deficit, or if he is to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approaches taken by the ODS and social democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed, remarked Nečas.
On Wednesday, the House accepted the budget for 2010, naturally with the left's proposed amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House gave extra money for the salaries of state employees, for social services, and for direct payments to farmers.
he government criticised the social democrats' proposals, saying that they will surreptitiously increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
Before the vote, the ODS left the room, complying with the government's wishes that the amended budget is not as poor an option as the provisional budget.
Disappointment and futility
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his feeling of disappointment and futility, while Premier Jan Fischer said that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota were to really threaten to resign should the proposed amendments be accepted, the situation would look completely different.
According to Czech Television, Janota has made an appointment to see the Prime Minister on Monday after the session.
At the same time, he indicated that he was rethinking his position in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment in the budget talks.
If Fischer commits himself to continuing the fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the ČSSD appointees who carried through the budget amendments have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly state that he will hand in his resignation if the House approves other laws that will increase the deficit, those relating to sick pay, pensions, or the amendment to the Civil Servants Act for example.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed to the ODS have committed no offence
This is a matter for the ministerial chairman Fischer and the government as a whole.
Ministers appointed to the ODS have done nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in a text report from the USA.
He pointed out that several ministries employ people in under-secretary positions who support TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas emphasised that, if Fischer were to decide to resign on the principle of the fight against the public finances deficit, "it is totally logical and correct that he falls back on the left majority currently in the House."
But then he would not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and I'll concentrate on that when the time comes, defence minister Martin Barták told reporters in the House, having been elected by the civil democrats.
This afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels to attend a European Council meeting.
ODS stands down at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas also stressed that, on Wednesday in the House, the ODS would evidently have voted against the amended budget if the Prime Minister had not explicitly asked the civil democrats to allow the budget to be approved.
We don't look like orphans, we're not little children, was how he reacted to the question of whether the ODS was not hampered by the presence of the party chairman in the parliament and in the Czech Republic during the political negotiations regarding the budget.
I didn't notice that my vote was missing.
Back when I renounced my mandate, I knew that the following months would see the Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of all that is positive, Topolánek himself responded.
