Baskonia gives away a victory in Israel
Caja Laboral achieved a stunning 82-91 victory on their visit to the Maccabee Electra court despite Dusko Ivanovic's team's heavy losses, and after the great performance by Mizra Teltovic, who was the best on his team with eight three-pointers scored (29 points), they now at the top of their group.
The Vitorian team knew to make up for the significant absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas and Micov with a big dose of involvement and team work, even though it had to hold out until the end to take the victory.
Additionally, their huge success from the sidelines, with 16 three pointers scored, had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The game started out in favor of the Azulgranas, who put themselves ahead on the scoreboard from the start.
As Vitora's first four baskets were from the perimeter, the speculation was already that they had jumped into the Israeli net with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main scorers of the 18-20 at the end of the first period.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavan team opted for the inside game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was greeted with whistles and applause at his return home, to continue increasing their lead by half-time (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to stand out as the best on his team with 13 points, even though Splitter's "six fewer" points already signaled that it wasn't going to be the best night for the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being headed for half time, was not more decidedand the Maccabees tried to remind the Vitorians that not just anybody wins on their court, and with the 'hand of Elias' putting the pressure on, they managed to get involved in the game.
Eidson and Pnini played a decisive role in the "yellows'" return to the light.
More disadvantages
Ivanovic's players, injured but far from dead, needed to run a couple of plays correctly before they could breathe, and that's when the machine gun Marza Teletovic arrived, with three almost consecutive three-pointers and the help of English and Ribas, he brought the scoreboard back to a reassuring lead (54-67), which the home team managed to narrow down at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavas worked themselves to the bone in the last period, and English and San Emeterio (65-75) had already made it clear that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had earned during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best on their team, did not give up and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
In spite of this, and with Splitter fouling out, Ivonic's team didn't rush, defended well, and, even though the Israelis came close at the last minute, the game ws already won and victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
