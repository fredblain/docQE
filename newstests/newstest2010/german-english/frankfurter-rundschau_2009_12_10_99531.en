The snow can come
A really hard, frosty winter, that is what Wolfgang Brauburger is wishing for.
Not because he wants to make a laughing stock of people, says the the head of the FES winter road maintenance service.
But so that his employees can try out and learn every facit of their vehicle's technology.
This may be the case for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
Here, the FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as Frankfurt is blanketed in snow and the temperatures drop below zero, 20 so-called "A Routes" are serviced by large-scale distribution vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include, for instance, main traffic roads and through roads, such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstrasse.
But also fire roads, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and roads with slopes, such as Atzelbergstrasse.
The service of the FES starts at three in the morning
The approx. 1,040 km would, if necessary, have to be gritted with wet salt, which has better adhesive properties, within no more than three hours.
That is why the FES start at three in the morning, "so the routes are free by the time commuter traffic starts".
It becomes difficult when it only begins snowing at 7.30 am.
Then we are faced with a problem, says the head of the winter road service, "because nobody is prepared to make way for the gritting vehicles".
Only then, unless it continues to snow, is it the turn of approach and connecting roads, which also include Rat-Beil-Strasse.
The last priority are quiet side and minor roads.
That is where complaints are made, knows Brauburger.
At five in the morning, the footmen of the FES set to work, and dangerous areas and passages are cleared.
The FES can usually not attend to all bike routes.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges, in particular from 10 pm until 4.30 am, says Brauburger.
As slippery ice quickly forms on them, the gritter sets off as soon as temperatures drop below two degrees centigrade.
Where required, it is also called out by the police.
