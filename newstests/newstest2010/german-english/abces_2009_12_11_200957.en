Brazil sets a release date for Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has put a deadline on Manuel Zelaya's stay in the embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the embassy by the 27th of January, 2010 at the latest, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, the chargé d’affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, told TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy,where he has been a refugee since 21st September, before that date.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27th, the end of his term; he has to look for another occupation."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My plan is to leave as soon as possible, obviously with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said via telephone.
Following the November 29th elections (in which Profiro Lobo was elected), Zelaya said that he would remain in the embassy until January.
However, this very week, he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally ended unsuccessfully with the rejection of Zelaya's political refugee status, which the Government headed by Roberto Micheletti tried to impose "de facto".
