History-Geography are strengthened by the secondary schools reform, according to Chatel
French Education Minister, Luc Chatel, declared in an interview to be published in the French Paper On Sunday (JDD) that History and Geography were "reinforced" by the secondary schools reform, despite them no longer being obligatory subjects for the French technical Sixth Form.
From now on, first year pupils will have four hours per week, and the same programme for a common shared culture, states Mr. Chatel.
According to the minister, "We need to get out of this hypocrisy" because, he says, "the 'S' course of study is no longer the science course", but "more generally, it is a magnet for the stronger pupils".
The 'ES' and 'L' courses cannot remain inferior choices behind the 'S' course, he continues, highlighting that "I have not heard many historians or academics expressing indignance at the absence of History-Geography in the technical Sixth Forms either."
On Saturday, an IFOP (French Public Opinion Institute) poll appearing in L'Humanit√© revealed that nearly seven out of ten (69%) French people disapproved of the Government project to terminate compulsory teaching of History-Geography in technical Sixth Forms. Many academics and teachers also criticised this suppression, as have the left and some right-wing representatives.
On the other hand, the minister added that there was "no question" of eliminating the 'S' course philosophy.
Luc Chatel also defended the teachers' education reforms, just as 16 organisations (students and associations) called for a day of protest on Tuesday to demonstrate against the project, which, in their opinion, sacrifices the educational training of future teachers.
For 2nd year Master's (M2), an entry exam focusing on the candidate's discipline will be required at the start of the year, and an acceptance exam testing their capacity to teach will be held at the end of the year, the minister explained.
Furthermore, they will cover in-class placements throughout the M2 year, and will then be in front of pupils for a year as student teachers.
If you add up all the placement work proposed before the exam you already end up with more presence in front of students, which equates to over 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister indicates that he will be putting forward "the individual's right to education; something that does not exist in national Education".
He also reaffirms the plan to abolish the school map "by 2012".
