This year, women were awarded the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
In Stockholm today, a record five women received Nobel Prizes from the Swedish king Carl XVI Gustaf in the professional categories and for literature.
In addition to four scientists, they also included the German writer Herta MÃ¼ller, originally from Romania.
The Nobel Prize for medicine went to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their fellow countryman Jack Szostak, for their research in chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was won by the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for their work to clarify the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last award was the Nobel Prize for Economics, which went to the Americans Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic management.
The only specialised category which nobody won this year was physics.
Today, this prize was won by the scientists Charles Kao, for his research in optical fibres, and George Smith and Willard Boyle, for inventing the CCD ship, which is the basis for all digital cameras, faxes, and astronomical telescopes.
All the winners received a diploma, the Nobel Medal, and a certificate for a monetary reward.
In each category, this award totals ten million Swedish krona (approximately 25 million CZK).
If there are multiple winners, they share the prize money between them.
Traditionally, the most highly-anticipated award, the Nobel Peace Prize, went to the American president Barack Obama in the Norwegian city of Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged that the award was controversial, as he is just starting out in office and, moreover, heads a country which is currently at war in two countries - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defence of his policy he added, however, that these wars were essential in order to bring about peace, despite the high cost.
