A management revolution or the end of competitive intelligence?
If nothing changes in the way France's biggest enterprises are run, our fight for the development of competitive intelligence will have been in vainâ€¦
For over ten years, the Management's attitude in large enterprises towards their employees reflects the position of enterprises and their consumers before the marketing revolution: employees should be made to adhere to "values" dictated from above just as it was in the past, when products dreamed up by the factory's engineers were dropped on the consumer.
By placing the consumer at the heart of the organisation, the marketing revolution put the strategies for conquering markets the right way up again... even if authoritarian temptation to impose products, which are disconnected from the preferences of the consumer tend to resurface regularly!
A demobilisation of employees can lead to terminal demoralisation.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the visible part of a far more widespread problem that affects management employees in particular.
Demobilisation gravely compromises the development of an organisation's strategic functions, notably in R&D, but even more so in competitive intelligence.
Indeed, CI "demands from all sides concerned (...) a proactive approach and a long-term vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that is entirely contradicted by authoritarian management methods.
For this reason, we are calling for a management revolution, which would consist in placing employees at the centre of an enterprise's concerns alongside consumers.
The very relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys - such as those given by Orange to its employees - stimulate this revolution in managerial methods?
Unfortunately, I fear it will not.
- Firstly, because I have witnessed that, when faced with a new situation, any organisation will arrive, after many detours, at doing chiefly... what it always does!
- Next, because authoritarianism - a disease of power - grows proportionally with the magnitude of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
Coming from the top technical educational establishments, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behaviourist theory, which has recently been re-awakened by the "neuro-sciences" of the United States that have been widely and silently diffused by business institutes and the Media.
In this way, by suggesting that "levers" [sic] can be pulled for the commitment of management staff, a recent Ipsos survey published on Figaro.fr cradles leaders into a position of mechanistic governance, which is unsuited to the world of today.
Identify and quantify mobilisation factors
In contrast, the management revolution needed for the correct functioning of modern enterprises supposes the adoption of a finalistic vision of human behaviour.
It consists in the integration, within all management strategies and practices, of a fundamental admission: for employees, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it is clearly perceived as a means to realising a part of their dreams, their ambitions, and their plans.
Currently, only studies produced through motivation factor analysis adopt the concept of employee motivation.
These studies have demonstrated that they form a view of their organisation based on a pre-determined consensus of opinion, which allows them, by means of this perceived view, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life plans.
By identifying and gauging these mobilisation factors, enterprise leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and turn their management of resources "the right way round".
They thereby create a favourable terrain for the concerted development of robust and effective competitive intelligence.
