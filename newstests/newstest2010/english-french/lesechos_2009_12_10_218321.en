USA: Polanski's lawyer calls afresh for proceedings to be dropped
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish film director, Roman Polanski, called again in Los Angeles on Thursday (California, western United States), for the abandonment of proceedings against his client, who is currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a vice case that is over 30 years old.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of "The Pianist" cited grave errors in the procedures at the time of the events in 1977, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal of California's second district.
I am calling for charges to be dropped here and now, declared Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge, who was dealing with the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "sends chills down the spine".
According to him, judge Rittenband -- since deceased -- is said to have spoken with one of the prosecutors, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison, before passing sentence -- constituting a serious error in procedure.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", the words coming straight from the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
However, Mr. Wells had eventually declared that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary at the end of September.
In the event of the court's refusal to abandon proceedings, Mr. Hummel called for a trial to be held, which would allow him to present evidence to back his arguments.
The Prosecution, for its part, has re-iterated its argument, already formed in the first instance, that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously looked at while Roman Polanski did not present himself in court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States before his sentence had been passed for "unlawful sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He has not set foot in the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor for Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, therefore declared that Roman Polanski "must be present at the hearing".
For this case, are we trying to send the message, not just to (Roman Polanski) but also other defendants, that it is ok to flee? asked Mrs. Asayama.
In her view, the filmmaker "is asking a favour from the court, while at the same time showing disregard for its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to return their verdict -- has also emphasised "that there are other alternatives to fleeing".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to request that proceedings against Roman Polanski be abandoned.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called once again for an end to the proceedings.
Reminding that her client can no longer stand to be harassed with every resurfacing of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can claim that this was a just procedure.
Thirty two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on the 26th of September in Switzerland on an American warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was put under house arrest at his chalet in Gstaad, pending his possible extradition.
