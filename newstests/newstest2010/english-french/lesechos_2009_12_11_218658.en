Miss World pageant once again in South Africa
After a month-long trek across South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are preparing to enter the final straight on Saturday to make their dream come true: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
During this grand beauty congregation organised for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them have already landed their tickets to the semi-final.
Miss Japan, Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar, and Yanbing Ma from Canada have been elected Miss World Sportswoman or also Miss World Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
To visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Cape Town is extraordinary.
I saw so many things and I have so much new experience, said Miss of Sierra Leone.
This competition, which is taking place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be transmitted live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I could not have dreamed of a better country to award my crown.
The experience was fascinating.
I am pleased to have been able to live it twice, points out Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second visit to South Africa has been made memorable by the many talks with candidates and the re-discovery "of landscapes in this country that take your breath away".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings, and safaris, the Miss candidates are concentrating on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this vote, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become stars of Bollywood.
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not all about appearance.
We are ambassadors for our countries and I want to return home with the crown, asserts Miss India with a broad smile.
According to organisers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional outfits and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be presented by Angela Chow, an ethnic Chinese television presenter, the South African ex-beauty queen Michelle McLean, and an officer from the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa showed that it could welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is difficult to better, affirms Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates went on safari, as they did last year, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and sampled the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for a head of State, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably be the World Cup draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for football in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I have mixed with people I never thought I would be able to approach.
I will without a doubt be returning for the 2010 World Cup, enthuses Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
