Comprehensive Beauty
Everything you could want in terms of beauty and comfort -at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés, which has just opened a multidisciplinary space of more than 1,000m2 dedicated to bodycare and pampering in the Callao (Madrid) shopping center, seems to be aiming for.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious firms like Hedonai, offering laser hair removal ; Spaxión, with relaxation and rooms for beauty treatment;hairdressers Luis & Tachi; Marina d'Or, which has a gym; and L'Occitane and their natural cosemtics, among others.
There is also a food section, which features a teashop with more than 130 different kinds of tea.
Enjoying a relaxing masage with your partner while you look out over the unbeatable views of the capital, or renting out the relax area for 2 hours to throw your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relaxing with a jacuzzi session, massages, and drinking a glass of champagne are just some of the possibilities Spaxión offers.
A total of 250 m2 are distributed amongst 12 rooms to carry out the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite, or vibration platforms.
The gym has these machines, in addition to virtual trainers which guide the steps of the clients, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
Everything starts by entering your personal key on the touch screen situated in front of the machine.
Then, various videos show us how to properly perform our workout plan.
Its director guarantees that 15 minutes (including warm up and stretching) are enough to exercise all of the muscles in the body.
And, if after our workout we want to drop by the hairdresser's,Luis & Tachi provides a salon where they offer personal hair services to restore its brilliance and nutrition.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the premise of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 10:00 at night.
