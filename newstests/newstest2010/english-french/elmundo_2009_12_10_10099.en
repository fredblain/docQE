Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become the image of the brand's different products, singing the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it.'
The star of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the finest actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities signed to L'Oreal Paris, like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones to enter such an elite club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
For the men's line, the cosmetic brand also includes deluxe ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's co-star on 'Lost').
