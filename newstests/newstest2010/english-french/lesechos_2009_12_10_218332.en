USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola fetches 1.5 million USD
A Roman sarcophagus panel, which had notably belonged to the French writer, Emile Zola, fetched 1.5 million dollars on Thursday, a significantly higher figure than was estimated, announced art auction house Sotheby's.
This front panel, measuring two metres in length and 63cm in height, dating back to the 3rd century AD, was valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble "depicting four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece; there are only five of them in the world", Florent Heintz, vice-president of art auctions for Roman and Egyptian antiquities, had explained to the AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among around a hundred other lots.
The auction is still going on, but this lot is certainly the one, which has got buyers bidding most so far, commented Sotheby's spokesman to the AFP, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of Emile Zola's acquisition of this marble piece dates back some time.
The panel remained in the famous collection of the Borghese family in Rome for nearly 300 years, then it successively appeared with the French actress, Cécile Sorel, who had made it a feature of her bathroom in her private Paris mansion, then Paul Reynaud, a minister in France's 3rd Republic and briefly the Council's chairman before Marshal Pétain's accession to power.
That left a grey area of about fifty years.
By searching the Louvre Museum's database, Florent Heintz discovered that the panel was part of an "Emile Zola inheritance" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the series of "Rougon-Macquart" novels.
