The Iberdrola Chairman, Ignacio Sanchez Galan, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the House of Representatives, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is currently being debated.
After his speech, which was followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galan gave the press a few glimpses of what was planned in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, while they keep operating the nuclear power plants which are presently open.
Otherwise, the investments required will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Yes, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be spent on increasing its generating capacity, but on distribution networks and on international interconnections.
From 2020 on, the matter changes and the power will have to increase.
His bet is in both coal plants withcarbon dioxide catchers and, especially, renewable sources of energy.
In this case, he considers that it takes 18,000 new MW, and that is with "support energy."
Though he believes that the Sustainable Economy Act, which the government has just approved, is in line with what his company has been calling for, Galan would not draw blood with a royal decree to promote the consumption of domestic coal, which contradicts the policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear, long-term gamble" in this sense, despite the "sure" measures, as the Chairman of Iberdrola calls them.
As it is, Galan believes that the decisions to invest, even though they are long-term, should start to be made since it has already taken a long time to think them through, and a stable framework for addressing remuneration is necessary.
