Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with Barcelona City Council, has created 'Office LIVE.'
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
Office LIVE' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city, and will define the conditions for mobility, management, coordination, present subsidies, etc.
Moreover, MOVELE will develop the project, promote the electric car, review public opinion and work from the sectors involved.
In short, it hopes to promote what will be the transportation of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that is going to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle within the MOVELE plan.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
With that, it hopes to promote the activities of the Research and Technological Development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities linked to energy and, in particular, energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative Endesa is involved in regarding the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at the European level and has a series of active complementary projects, such as G4V, ELVIRE and CENIT VERDE.
