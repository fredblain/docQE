The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", according to son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", assures his son, David, on Friday arriving at the airport in Los Angeles, where he was to be by his father's bedside, who has been in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, all will go well, declared his son, David Hallyday, to the Press on leaving the plane from Paris just after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son had a relaxed air and assured that he would be heading "without delay" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection stemming from a slipped disc operation on November 26th in Paris.
The singer was "put in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent his suffering, and to allow his treatment to be administered", indicated the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been put in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection stemming from a slipped disc operation on the 26th of November in Paris.
The singer had to be operated on in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of significant lesions resulting from the operation.
His wife, Laeticia, went on Friday morning to the Los Angeles French High School, where their daughter Jade is enrolled, to attend a school performance, observed an AFP photographer.
The Head of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to see the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer vehemently brought into question Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neuro-surgeon, who operated on the singer on the 26th of November at the International Clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was carnage.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were aghast, declared Mr. Camus.
I heard talk of possible legal proceedings to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus reckoned that Johnny Hallyday had "left far too soon for Los Angeles, with the Paris surgeon's authorisation".
I had this doctor on the phone in person, and he assured me that there was no problem for this trip, which shocked me, as I, myself, have had two slipped discs, he added.
Shortly before, on RTL, he had indicated that the singer apparently "had left without a drain or anything", following his Paris operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in artistic circles.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a haematoma, following a cerebral haemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a notorious reputation, convicted by the Law on several occasions, in cases of medical liability, as well as for fraud and tax evasion.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Doctors' governing body, accused him of being "a man without scruples", who "regularly" has to answer to the governing body's Council, and who is "far from reputable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made an announcement on Friday through his solicitor, David Koubbi.
The latter indicated that the operation had "gone perfectly well" and that post-operation tests returned "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not required a drain to be fitted", he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, for whom health problems have been multiplying since the summer, would seem to be on hold.
Clearly, resuming the tour on the 8th of January [in Amiens] as planned seems very soon, declared Mr. Camus.
