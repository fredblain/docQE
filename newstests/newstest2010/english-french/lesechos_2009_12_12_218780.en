Large climate change gatherings in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to support an ambitious and restrictive agreement in the fight against global warming around the world and in Copenhagen, where police made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, and a hundred thousand, according to the organisers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital outside the United Nations climate conference, which is tasked with reaching an agreement by Friday that will enter into effect on the 1st of January, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish climate conference president, the increasing number of climate rallies around the world, illustrated by these protests, has contributed to making the 'political cost' of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the main procession, when a group of 300 protesters, clothed entirely in black, broke shop windows with paving and hammers, observed a reporter from the AFP.
Riot police provided an immediate and unhesitant response.
Police announced a total of 600 to 700 hundred arrests, with most, they report, being members of the 'Black Blocks'; small ultra-violent groups that had notably made an appearance at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the East of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the protest organisers, reported conditions whereby hundreds of protesters were arrested "without discrimination," highlighting that a hundred of them "were still detained in the street on Saturday night" handcuffed and held in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Having left the Parliament, the procession headed in an orderly fashion towards the Bella Center, where negotiations were to take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres short of the building without trying to enter.
A stage had been raised to receive the expected speakers before a candlelit vigil, in which the former South African Archbishop from Cape Town, Desmond Tutu would be taking part.
The majority of protesters had arrived by coach and train from the major European cities, but many Asian protesters, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present, as well as those from Africa.
Around 3000 people, mainly clad in sky blue raincoats, had formed an initial rally in Copenhagen during the morning, called by Friends of the Earth, who were planning "blue waves" for "climate justice".
We are marching on the streets today to demand reparations of the ecological debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist in the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to tell ourselves that there is time left, assesses the singer from Benin, Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying out in Africa; water courses, where it is possible to walk and never was before.
For the first time in the history of Climate Diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalisation movement has brought itself closer to environmental organisations.
The French Eurodeputy, José Bové, a face of anti-globalisation, explained that he has come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice with social justice" : "Today there is no gap between the fight against global warming and the anti-globalisation fight."
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to numerous islands, which are particularly vulnerable to the effects of warming, had kicked off the protests.
According to organisers, some 50 000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, brandishing banners about the benefits of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Djakarta, and in Canada, rallies of several hundred demonstrators were also formed to demand more forceful action against climate change.
In France, the protests organised by the "350" network brought together several hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseilles (in the South), Lille (in the North), Bordeaux (in the West), and Lyon (in the East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
