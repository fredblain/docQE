75% of working mothers have had work problems during maternity.
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This has been revealed by a study entitled 'Fertility and work history of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women from 15 to 75 years old leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers have seen their opportunities in the workplace limited due to maternity.
The study notes that there are many differences in when couples start cohabiting, in the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do.
Those that don't have an activity outside of the home, work part time, or don't have a stable job start living with their partner sooner, expect their first child, and have more children.
By contrast, women with a stable job, especially in the public sector, put off cohabitation and motherhood and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years old with steady work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting to live together,a figure which increases to 4.1; women with steady jobs need more time to achieve their lifelong goals, which has led them to postpone getting married and having children.
Additionally, the type of job held has a great influence over maternity, but less over the mating schedule," explains CSIC researcher, Margarita Delgado.
Level of education is another factor whichdifferentiates the age of women marrying and having their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the age at which they get married and have their first child.
There was also a difference among women from the same generation.
For example, in a group of 35- to 49-year-olds, those who had elementary and those who and higher education had become mothers for the first time, on average, at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
Their level of education provides yet another division among women.
While those who have an elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have secondary or higher levels of education reverse the sequence and give priority to securing a stable job as a precondition to marriage and having a child," Delgado specifies.
