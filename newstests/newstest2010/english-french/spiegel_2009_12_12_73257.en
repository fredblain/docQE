Dream worlds
Some see images and hear voices when they are awake which others do not hear or see.
Not only in the mentally sick and during intoxication with drugs do the borders between imagination and reality become blurred.
As long as this happens in sleep, things are fine.
When we are in dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can surrender to the wildest imaginations and fantasies without restraint.
But anybody experiencing dream-like conditions or seeing and hearing things other people do not when they are awake, is regarded in contemporary Western society as a madman or drug addict, or strange at the very least.
But such images and voices are formed not only in the mentally sick or during drug intoxication.
This is down to our imagination: The same neural processes which allow us to design houses, draw paintings or write novels can make the borders between dream, madness and reality become blurred.
Conscious conditions which are warped like dreams can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Even if their triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shaman detachment from reality conditions, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucination or delusions occur when the balance of the neural transmitters of the brain - predominantly dopamine noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - derails and the interaction of different brain segments is dysfunctional.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychoses.
Gravity no longer has any power over him
The connection between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations to be a form of dream while awake, Wilhelm Griesinger, a founder of modern psychiatry, detected in 1861 a "huge similarity of madness and dreamlike conditions", for Sigmund Freud dreams were even "a psychosis, with all puzzles, delusions and misperceptions of such".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and excessively gaudy.
Gravity no longer has any power over him, he floats at the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him are winged devilish figures with red, distorted faces, snarling.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices emerge from the walls and radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that abuse and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, ties them to a knot and attaches it to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a speaker and puts the noose around his neck.
He jumps.
The noose becomes loose.
Let that be a lesson to you, the voices scream in an eardrum-tearing choir, "go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has had six acute psychoses, the last one is two years back, the first nearly 20 years ago.
It was caused by LSD.
His diagnosis is a schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, he is also a manic-depressive, he takes drugs against depression, the mania and schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I experienced the worst fear and deepest desperation, he says.
The illusions are a brutal reality
About 1 per cent of the population suffers at least once in their lifetime from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics, it is treated with a frequency only second to depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, people affected can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they reach an overexcited condition which can result in hallucinations, megalomania, paranoia or persecution mania.
Particularly common is the hearing of voices - voices which command, comment or involve in dialogue.
Visual hallucinations are also not rare.
The affected person can no longer distinguish important things from unimportant things, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the conscious is flooded by impressions.
Like dreams, a psychosis also opens the floodgates on a flood of ideas and phantasies, which stem from the deeper levels of the conscious.
The perception of reality in a psychosis is subject-centred, says professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Clinic of Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic patients are at the heart of the events, the meaning of everything is directed to him.
At the same time, he finds himself in a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events can cannot affect them actively.
Schizophrenic patients therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is often not available to them, the illusions are a brutal reality, waking up is not possible.
To experience a hallucination once in your life
Contrary to dreams, says Fuchs, "the sensual and spatial structure of reality, as perceived during a psychosis, remains intact as a rule".
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the distortion of the events takes place within a framework of reality.
Precisely why our brain plays such tricks on us, is still puzzling to scientists.
Extraordinary conditions can cause any person to lose his sense of reality for a short period of time, says Fuchs.
But not everybody will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic tendency to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the sole factor.
Scientists assume that patients have minimal brain damage.
We think that the neuronal maturing of the brain is disturbed in an early stage of development, through a virus infection in the mother during pregnancy, for instance, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how disturbances to the neuronal system comes about which also do not become manifest for many years initially.
Environmental impacts also play a part - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger psychoses if the disposition is given.
Hallucinogen drugs can trigger psychoses, as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The mad thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medication to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get the same, says Lübeck-based psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether these illusions are perceived to be pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of perspective.
Kasten has been collecting reports for ten years on hallucinations and delusions; last year he assessed his results in a book titled The unreal World in our Head.
Hallucinations are a typical by-product of psychoses, but also of a remarkably large amount of other diseases.
These include, on top of mental illnesses such as borderline or depression, also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injuries.
Surprisingly, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, says Kasten, consist of memory fragments, which are often held back.
They occur when areas of the brain, where sensory perceptions are processed, are overactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain runs hot and also when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as much as brain damage or a psychosis.
But sensory deprivation, stress, lovesickness or other mental exceptional conditions too.
In more recent studies, up to one third of respondents claimed to have experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she is living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to the local secondary school.
Indeed, a perfectly normal girl.
It it were not for the images and voices.
During breaks, it can happen that a lanky boy with long dark hair approaches her.
When she answers him, her schoolmates look at her in surprise - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think the girls is a nutty daydreamer, but Sarah K. is not dreaming, she knows that much.
She is awake, she sees and hears this boy, just like she sees and hears the girl at the desk next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for some moments.
A pleasant feeling it is, she likes the boy.
Am I mad? she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and disappear again.
At night the appearances are usually frightening
The illusions are often a strain.
When she is sitting in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow because the teacher is to her eyes and ears just introducing a new schoolmate, while she is explaining mathematical equations on the blackboard for everyone else.
At night the appearances are usually frightening.
When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which comes far too rarely and late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs is standing in front of her open or closed eyes.
Let me be, she screams at the figures.
She does not tell her parents or friends anything about this, they would think she was mad.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old now.
She passed her A levels last year and is now living with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted psychologist Kasten via the internet, she knows exactly that she is not mad.
Madness is also work of art born out of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from sensory deprivation, he will very probably suffer from hallucinations after some time, says Kasten.
I assume that the brain is not busy enough and creates its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children when she was small; she often played alone.
Her hallucinations started when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called dad since she could think was not her natural father.
As during visual and acoustic hallucinations those areas of the brain become active which also process real impressions and sounds, it is often difficult for patients like Sarah K. to distinguish between illusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is reproduced there.
Hallucinations are also images, which the brain creates, this is why they seem so real."
Illusions at night are also classified by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of the healthy are not fundamentally different from those during an acute psychosis.
Contrary to schizophrene patients, mentally healthy people are able to identify illusions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate hallucinations as a special ability.
Border between dream and hallucination
In our far too conscious-centred world, imaginary experiencing is often unfortunately pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and senior physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful illness, but it also brings positive aspects, creativity - madness is also a work of art born out of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid experience, a particular form of conscious conditions which are warped like dreams.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams, which the person experiencing them believes are real and which he later cannot distinguish from being awake.
The oneiroid condition occurs in trauma- or sickness-related extreme situations, for instance in polyradiculitis patients, who experience a motor paralysis in full consciousness.
If a person is threatened by self- or world loss, for instance due to persistent, complete loss of mobility, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with an own, imaginary world, which is uncoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border between dream and hallucination
As the mastering of a situation is not possible in reality, a change of world takes place, but the real situation is not updated in the imagination.
An intense form of creating and applying meaning in an unbearable situation, which allows us people our own ability to design and not go under in the emptiness of a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zurich-based art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book A Change of Heart as the sole's attempt to safe itself.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness takes off on journeys for days after heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplantation while his body is damned to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen delves into a world of his creation, visits foreign places and times: He experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watching over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages amongst noblemen who make intoxicants from blood.
He is abducted by a Greek man on his motorbike to his homeland, surfs with his hospital bed in the spring snow of the Alps and meets a Korean member of the mafia.
He is fully taken up with the imaginary events; everything is real, even later in his memory.
These inner trips, Claussen believes, are fundamentally different from every dream.
Dream is a different condition, he describes his experience.
Contrary to that, the memories from mental trips are overtly clear to me even after years and in minute detail.
Even clearer and more intense that real events.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our day-to-day experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our images of the external reality are, even when awake.
Every change to the conscious, summarises psychologist Kasten, "can result in a warping of what we call reality".
An experience which can indeed be enriching.
