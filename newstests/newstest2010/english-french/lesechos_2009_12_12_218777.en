Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president; Georgia calls it a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little over a year after Moscow's recognition of the pro-Russian region of Georgia, while Tbilisi calls it a "farce".
Some 131 000 people were called on to take part in this first vote following the Georgia-Russia war in August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another secessionist Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
Attendance was at 58% a few hours before closure, according to Abkhazian electoral Commission officials.
The first provisional results were to be announced during the night between Saturday and Sunday.
The five candidates in the running, among whom the existing president, Sergei Bagapsh, all categorically reject the idea of a reunification with Georgia, which has condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," declared his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Other than Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of the territory's 216 000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating itself from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict, which saw the loss of several thousand lives, Abkhazia is trying to show, by means of this election, that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared Svetlana Kvarchia, a 54-year-old historian, who confirms having voted for Mister Bagapsh.
She was among the voters who came to the polling station in an attractive white school building with several palm trees at the front in the capital, Soukhoumi.
The question of the Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential debate, in this region gifted with a lush landscape on the Black Sea.
Vast billboards showing Mister Bagapsh beside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are dotted around this small territory of 216 000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the West of the country, the Chief of District, Beslan Archba, reserved a very warm welcome for the Russian officials who came to oversee the voting.
We, the Abkhazian people, are thankful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to the support from Moscow, and particularly to the decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament, while raising his glass of vodka.
For their part, the opposition represented in the vote by the former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements made with Moscow in the previous year, such as the one giving Russia control of the Abkhazian rail network for the next 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, asserts not being in support of the current Government or the opposition.
50% plus one vote is the majority required to win the vote.
If no candidate attains this threshold, a second vote must be organised within two weeks.
