More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Going in and out of Germany is nice, virtually no checks..." is the first line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he describes in disturbing fragments a dissident's experience of arrival, who had gained freedom but simultaneously lost his language area.
Werner Söllner, born in Romania's Banat in 1951, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children's publishing house, before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has won several literature awards, in 1993 he was awarded the legendary Frankfurt Poetry Readings at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hesse Literature Forum in the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
He caused a major extra-literary stir last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, debating "German literature in Romania in the reflection and distortion of its Securitate files".
Clearly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner read out a statement, in which he admitted before Romano-German writer colleagues, i.e. Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his participation as an IM for the Romanian secret service, Securitate.
Jointly with some of those present, Söllner 1989 had received the German language award in 1989.
The recruitment attempts started gradually, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "therefore someone, who did not put up enough resistance to the intimidation attempts of the Securitate."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Virtually at the same time as the awarding of the Nobel prize for Herta Müller and her unmatched literary discussion of the mechanisms of dictatorships, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors with Romanian roots is being shocked by a case which reveals the dark spots and perfidy of a political system based on control and spying.
Werner Söllner is, inasmuch as can be said on the basis of the current knowledge, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a part, said after Söllner's confession the literary scholar Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence IM Walter had for him.
He "boxed him out" in all points which were dangerous for him at the time, said Markel.
He has a moral need to make this statement.
Söllner's statement was in this form unexpected before this audience, although the confession of a former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising.
Germany was a cosy habitat for the Security spies, as Herta Müller had already written in July in the Zeit newspaper after reading her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, one can assume, will have guessed and in some cases even known whose real name was behind the code names of Sorin, Voicu and, of course, Walter.
Contrary to the now very secure process of viewing Stasi files in Germany, the approach to the legacy of Securitate control is still very diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been undermined and hindered in recent years.
A National Council to Process Securitate Files (SNSAS), which is comparable to the Birthler Authority, was only set up in 1999, but the release of the files has been very slow.
A law regulating the administration of the files has only existed since 2005.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members is still very big in Romania was proven after the announcement of the Nobel prize for Herta Müller by an interview, in which a former Securitate head from Timisoara spoke in derogatory terms of the prize winner.
They is psychotic, she was, after all, questioned more than once.
The infamy of power believed it could openly speak in the guise of freedom of speech.
The Söllner case does, as so often in connection with silent guilt, raise questions.
Why only now? Who fell victim? The level-headed reaction of the audience to Söllner's statement gives rise to the hope that a continuation of this chapter will be determined by the need for information than finger-pointing and shame.
Regarding the genesis of Herta Müller's oeuvre, who yesterday received the Nobel prize, it is more than a footnote.
