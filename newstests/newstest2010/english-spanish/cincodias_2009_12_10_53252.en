Playing the Champions League has yielded 476.4 million to Madrid and Barcelona since it was first established
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it started in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have collected 476.4 million, making them the third and fifth club to have won the most money in the competition.
The head of the list is Manchester United.
The head of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn't just earn you glory.It is also a major source of income for the big clubs.
So much so that UEFA figures show that the competition has dealt out 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them from Spain) who have participated in the event since the tournament was founded in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have fared well in this distribution.
The white club has been the third on the continent to have pocketed more money from participating, and the only one, after AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan team, the defending champion and last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the rankings.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Much, two teams that have also made more money by participating in the Champions League.
And that is in spite of both of them losing against Barcelona.
What more, Spain is only the third country to have made more money through the Champions League despite having earned more titles than any other country (five, compared to Italy's four, England's three, and Germany's two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated payment system the UEFA uses.
For this fiscal year the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to collect 1.090 billion for the Champions League.
The UEFA dedicates 413.1 million of that money to pay fixed rates: each of the 20 clubs participating in the prequalifying round (including Atletico Madrid) receives 2.1 million.
Additionally, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for every game they play.
There are also bonuses for winning (800,000 euros) and for ties (400,000 for each team).The octa-finalists receive three million each; the eight quarterfinalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will pocket 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, versus the 5.2 million for the runner-up.
So, with the idea of the fixed rates, a club takes home at least 7.1 million, and at most 31.2 million.
Barcelona on the other hand pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are other varying payments to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportionate value of each television market.
Spain is the leader with four places allocated.
Last year's champion got 40% of the allocated money, 30% for second place, 20% for third, 10% for fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played this year.
