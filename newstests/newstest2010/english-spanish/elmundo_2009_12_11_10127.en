Sales of light commercial vehicles on the increase
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.6% from 2008, and, more importantly, indicates the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the manufacturers association(ANFAC) and the vendors association (GANVAM).
However, it's not time to start celebrating since the reference the comparison was made to -November 2008- was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease from the previous year.
The outcome is that, regardless of last month's upturn, the total number of registrations during those 11 months is 40% below last year's.
Since January, 95,853 units of all the vehicle classes which make up the hotchpotch of light commercial vehicles were sold: derived vans, pick ups, vans, light vans and light-chassis trucks.
At the same time, the storm clouds affecting demand have not completely cleared, so even though they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, almost all of which pay through external funding.
As a result of the restrictions caused by closed tap bank loans, it is necessary to add other factors like increasing unemployment and the persistent economic decline.
In light of this, unlike cars, the aid of the 2000Epurchase has done little.
Aside from individuals, provisions are made for the self-employed and SMEs that are going to purchase a light commercial vehicle of up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of transactions has been insignificant.
Just yesterday, the need for the Administration to devote special attention to these vehicles, and also to commercial verhicles (trucks and buses), was brought to mind by GANVAM.
The sellers' association predicts that 2010 will be similar to the year coming to a close, which estimates a 19% drop in sales (passenger cars and 4x4s).
