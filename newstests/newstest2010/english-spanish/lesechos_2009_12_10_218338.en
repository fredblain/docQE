Johnny Hallyday re-operated on, RTL claims he is in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated on in Los Angeles due to significant "lesions" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer has been placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on in the night between Wednesday and Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors noted "lesions resulting from the operation" for the slipped disc undergone in Paris on November 26th, his press office announced in Paris, adding that the lesions had "warranted a repair operation".
The singer's press office, however, wanted to be reassuring, stating that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated within 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner for the singer's first tour, however, Johnny Hallyday may have been put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It will only be in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the state of the patient, once he has at least one eye open, added RTL.
When questioned by the AFP, the press office neither confirmed, nor commented on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to certain sources", no drain was fitted after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on for a slipped disc at the international clinic at Parc Monceau.
The operation, scheduled several days in advance, had been carried out by the neuro-surgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in artist circles.
He was not available to comment on RTL's information on Thursday evening.
Following the operation that he carried out on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was taken on Monday to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital for an infection stemming from the operation.
The singer, Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad patch", but assured everyone that he had "no worries" about the rocker, who is a "fighter".
He had called me just before leaving for Los Angeles, and I told him that it was crazy, because taking a 12-hour flight after that kind of operation is not realistic, said Eddy Mitchell.
Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted to be reassuring, stating that Johnny Hallyday "was reacting satisfactorily to the antibiotics" and that the infection was being "contained".
Mr. Camus had also said to have spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and not to have noticed any signs of worry.
But health problems for the singer have only multiplied since he was hospitalised for nine days in July after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of all, Johnny Hallyday had revealed having had a "minor colonic cancer" operation, then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", billed as his final goodbye tour.
However, since then, every health problem is heavily commented on. Fans and reporters have noticed the singer's trouble in moving around on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny further hospitalisation.
