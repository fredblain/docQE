Poker by Manuel Vicent
In 'Four Aces' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) Manuel Vicent gives us thirty profiles of writers who have passed through their literary life (and, in some cases, the other one too).
He does not do it in predictable or terrible ways (biographical sketch, life and work),rather by looking for something that sparked the creation of the character.
The trip has its excitements, and Vincent us spares no scares or illuminations.
In addition to being an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to be read and reread.
Here are some snippets.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean wasn't a sea, rather a spiritual instinct, almost physical, the same one I felt without giving it a name: the pleasure against the ill-fated, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilistic, allegorical Christian, he wrote what was in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in which flesh combined the excitement of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege which consisted of reaching heaven through the road of perdition."
On James Joyce: "'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach.This is one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of world literature which must be scaled by the north face, which the best mountain climbers hurl themselves off time and time again."
On William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy."
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner in the county, and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
"They were both dreams of grandeur."
On Louis-Ferdinand Celine: "This writer took the deranged scream cried from a bridge by that character from Munich in order to carry his eco, under his literary form, into the depths of the night of the 20th century, and made it a journey, hiding from himself and calling on the past with a violent discourse to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day, she kneeled and prayed: ' Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman'."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved these verses from Spencer: 'Sleep after toil,/port after stormy seas,/ease after war,/ death after life does greatly please.'"
On Virginia Wolf: "She also carried her depressions in her luggage.
The husband accepted it as normal when she told him that Edward VII spied on her from the azaleas and that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been a man so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent came before her madness."
On Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja through the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do but abduct the glory of that man so that it would serve his own pedestal?
