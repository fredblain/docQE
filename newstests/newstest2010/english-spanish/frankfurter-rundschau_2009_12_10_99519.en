US banks repay state support
The crisis-hit US major banks are breaking free from their state shackles.
On Wednesday Bank of America repaid the support from the bank protection fund TARP in the amount USD 45 billion (nearly EUR 30 billion) in one go.
And, according to reports from US broadcaster CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay the state support.
The institutions thereby want to wiggle themselves free from the restrictions going hand-in-hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limits on manager bonuses and the paying of high charges.
Bank of America had raised some USD 19 billion from investors through convertible loans.
The rest of the amount was taken from its own kitty, which was well filled through the sale of business units.
Bank head Kenneth Lewis extended his express thanks to the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The cash injection helped over a very difficult time.
The bank overstretched at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also plans to raise cash on the capital market to free itself from its liabilities with the state.
Already on Thursday, the US bank was able to announce a capital increase of some USD 20 billion, reported CNBC with reference to circles.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their support in June.
