A new Silicon Valley
For many years, it was a secret city, inaccessible to Westerners.
Zelenograd, one of ten districts in the capital Moscow, was a highly guarded location for secret arms research during the Soviet Union.
Nowadays, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from Moscow centre is regarded as Russia's Silicon Valley.
Important research and production facilities for micro and nano technology are located here.
In September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd made contacts with the Frankfurt science centre in Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several visits, and on Wednesday Zelenograd and Riedberg finally signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt on Wednesday.
The Moscow Deputy Mayor, Yuri Roslyak, and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Zelenograd led the Russian delegation and Economic Affairs Head Edwin Schwarz signed on behalf of Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and small- and medium-sized companies focusing on research in natural science will travel to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
The idea is to establish continuous scientific exchange.
But business relations are also being eyed.
Companies of the FIZ will have the option to get a foothold in the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian businesses want to win orders in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters to the most important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for instance, the Moscow Institute of Electrophysics, and major companies such as Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (verbatim "green city") got its name from the wooded hills where the research facilities are located.
