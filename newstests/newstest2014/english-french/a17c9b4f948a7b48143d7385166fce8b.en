Classical Singing for Teenagers
The student body has, each time, been the target of an initiative that had a lot of success last season.
Teenagers have been given the chance to get to grips with classical singing through five short plays created and performed by regional artists - performances containing a large dose of humour.
Besides this show, the Société d'Art Lyrique du Royaume will be bringing back "Destinations Lyriques", a program that has been a crowd-puller at La Pulperie in Chicoutimi.
Two other concerts will be held in the summer of 2014, giving regional artists the chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these events, there was the Apéro Lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the support of coloratura soprano, Marie-Eve Munger.
This, in parallel with the artistic dimension, was a benefit event which helps the non-profit organisation achieve financial balance-sheet that sounds as soothing to the ear as a tune from Die Fledermaus.
Without giving precise figures, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, Yves Bergeron, used the press conference held at Chicoutimi yesterday to give assurances.
Despite the precarious situation that so many cultural institutions face, the future looks bright, even in the long term.
We have more solid and stable support.
"Finances are on an even keel and we hope to see the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a milestone we will reach in seven years," the administrator remarked.
"I would even say beyond that," added the general manager, Helene Gaudreault, with a smile.
