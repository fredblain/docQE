Two potholders aged 23 and 27 went missing in a cave under the Dent de Crolles on Thursday evening, according to a report from the Isère cave rescue organization on Friday.
They were found on Friday afternoon.
The two men, one experienced, the other not, set off underground on Thursday at around 9.30pm, in an attempt to cross the Dent des Crolles, which is in the district of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
There was no news of them after this, said the same source.
"The potholders were due to return at around 5am," said Thierry Larribe, technical consultant at the cave-rescue organization who organized the rescue efforts.
Dozens of people on site
Twenty or so rescuers, ten civilian members of the French cave-rescue organization, as well as the police, mountain rescue services and firefighters were on hand.
The two potholders were found late on Friday afternoon.
"Another group of potholders found them in the hollow exhausted but in good health and got a message to one of the rescue teams working in the network of tunnels," explained local newspaper, Le Dauphiné.
The two men, who are soldiers in the 13th Battalion of French Alpine Troops stationed in Chambéry, were found "exhausted but uninjured".
They got lost in the network, but retraced their steps while waiting for assistance, said the police.
After being given supplies, they are expected to exit the cave in the evening with the help of the rescuers.
