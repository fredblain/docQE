Pont-de-Buis Portico Dismantled
The ecotax portico in Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration against the tax took place on Saturday, was taken down on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on the site just after 10am, and traffic on the main road was diverted afterwards.
The decision to take the portico down, which was announced by the Finistère police department on Wednesday, was taken by Ecomouv, the company managing the portico.
This was the last of three ecotax porticos still operating in the department of Finistère, the other two having been taken down or sabotaged.
