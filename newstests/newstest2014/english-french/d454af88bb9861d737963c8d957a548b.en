United States Dressed for Halloween
US President Obama celebrated the tradition of Halloween.
Yesterday evening, he and his wife handed out sweets to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the USA were cancelled because Hurricane Sandy was on its way.
So this year, the merrymakers made up for it.
In New York, thousands of people in costumes took part in the parade organised in the Greenwich Village district.
"Everyone is super-excited," said Andrea, one of the participants.
"I was able to wear the costume I had planned for last year."
"Everyone is having a wild time," added Rhonda.
"People are happy.
It's relaxed, it's cool.
We really need this."
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated the day before All Saints' Day, principally in English-speaking countries.
