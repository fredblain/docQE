"La Nouvelle Star" made a big comeback in terms of audiences, with 1.3 million TV viewers, that is a 5.6% share of the viewing audience.
But was the show up to expectations?
Some 10,000 candidates turned up at the auditions to face the jury for this 10th season: Maurane, the naughty Sinclair, the high-pitched Andr√© Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
The viewers shared their thoughts on Twitter.
The excitement of finding their favorite programme having subsided, many are disappointed.
But why where they so disappointed?
None of the contestants seem to have really stood out at first glance.
As every year, the first audition shows threw in a wide variety of budding singers into the mix, sometimes for the best and sometimes not.
But, on Twitter, people want a spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, a few got just that.
Many people have tried "La Nouvelle Star", and some have even gotten through.
Behind the television screens, there are always those cut out to be successful singers, season after season.
Others are just out to make you laugh.
