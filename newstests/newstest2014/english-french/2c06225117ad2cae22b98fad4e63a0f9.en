Obama Ends Spying on IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop tapping the lines of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, said an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of attempts by the White House to resume control of the NSA phone-tapping affair following revelations by the former analyst, Edward Snowden, who has taken refuge in Russia.
This is the first time that surveillance of the IMF and World Bank by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the start of the scandal.
When asked about this, an official of the American administration replied: "The United States is not conducting electronic surveillance aimed at offices of the World Bank and IMF in Washington."
Talking under the cloak of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had taken place in the past.
Another official indicated that Barack Obama had given the order to stop these practices during recent weeks.
The instruction was given at almost the same time as that putting an end to phone-tapping of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this regard, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved strengthening of the controls on government surveillance programmes on Thursday, but still authorised them to proceed.
The committee introduced new restrictions on the data that the intelligence services were authorised to collect and imposed a limit of five years on the length of time they could hold such data.
