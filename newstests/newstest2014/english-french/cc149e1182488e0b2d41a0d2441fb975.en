Difficult Year for Pharmacists
The departure of almost 10 pharmacists from the Centre for Health and Social Services (CSSS) in Laval has caused turmoil amidst the managers of the Cité-de-la-Santé hospital in the year 2012-2013.
The pharmacy department has been left seriously short-staffed following multiple departures due to retirement, maternity leave or, simply, resignations.
There is a staff shortage of almost 30%, making the financial year "very difficult" according to department head, Gillian Beaudet.
Even so, the CSSS has decided not to employ independent labour, which could be up to three times more expensive than taking on a full-time pharmacist.
"We didn't resort to a stop-gap solution," explained Beaudet.
"We consolidated or reduced some of our activities within the institution to get around while waiting for things to fall back in place.
We clearly worked hard on trying to persuade our young [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.
A combination of circumstances put us in a difficult situation last year."
Improved situation
After this difficult period, 2013-2014 looks like a definitely easier one for the pharmacy department at the CSSS.
Three pharmacists have already returned to work after maternity leave and three others have been taken on in recent months.
In addition, the efforts made by the department to hold on to staff have paid off, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to stay on at the CSSS.
"Things are going much better now," stressed the pharmacist.
"By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three back from maternity leave.
So that will fill the gaps we had last year."
Need still growing
However, the situation is still precarious.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations like that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
"For us [the number of staff] is always precarious as this is a young environment where a lot of young women are being employed. So in terms of pregnancies, you can always count on three people being on maternity leave when things are going well," she added.
"Last year there were many more and there were no pharmacists available to replace them, so it was more difficult."
