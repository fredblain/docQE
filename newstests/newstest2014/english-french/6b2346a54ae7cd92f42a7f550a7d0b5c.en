A team of biologists working for the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new humpback dolphin species living off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, in charge of the scientific mission at the Observatoire pour la Conservation et l'Etude des Animaux et Milieux Marins (OCEAMM), discussed this discovery with L'Express and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Did the discovery of this new humpback dolphin species surprise you?
It's good news, but it didn't surprise me especially.
In the past, species have been described and identified on the basis of morphology, anatomy and geography. Today, the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge of the science of the classification of species.
Moreover, there is a possibility that these advances in genetics and molecular biology may call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a particular genus, family or even order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of the morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications have been questioned as a result of advances in genetics.
Likewise, two species that are very similar in morphology were distinguished using genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About a decade ago, scientists recognised two species that belonged to this sub-family: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have enabled four species to be distinguished.
Why is this a significant discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society says?
From the point of view of conservation, it is essential to be aware of genetic differences so a species and, thus, its genetic variability can be protected.
Researchers have known about this population for a long time, but they did not know that it was part of a new species that only lives in this location.
Hence, in the event of large-scale mortality in the region, caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture, we would know that we are dealing with the extinction of a species rather than the local disappearance of a population belonging to a much more widespread species.
Such loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered based on the number of its members alive on the planet, known as the stock, and of the possibility of the species restoring itself using neighbouring stocks.
The stock of the Sousa Chinensis species, from which the newly discovered population derives, has automatically grown weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new marine mammal species?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are numerous genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This blending of genes limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, more enclosed ecosystems favour genetic isolation, which can ultimately lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least known of environments.
We prefer sending robots to Mars rather than knowing what is living in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometres below the surface of the ocean.
More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research, and it is high time things changed.
