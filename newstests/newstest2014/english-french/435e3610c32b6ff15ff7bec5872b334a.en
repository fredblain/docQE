Fire in 1850 Quebec House
A historic house built in 1850 in Old Quebec was engulfed in flames on Friday at lunchtime.
The four-apartment building located at 15 Rue HÃ©bert set off three alarms at the fire department.
The fire started at the front, but spread to all three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the quick intervention of the fire brigade prevented the fire spreading to adjacent buildings, a major challenge in this part of town where the buildings are very close together.
The building damaged by the fire contained four apartments, but there was nobody at home when the fire started.
The damage was fairly limited all in all, although the water caused some harm.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the cause, although the fire brigade has ruled out the possibility of it being a criminal act.
