Musicals, the Great Performances
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or in French, song and dance productions are starting to take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris is finally finding its voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical is establishing itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, the majority of attempts, from 'Notre-Dame de Paris' to 'Mozart, l'Opéra Rock', have been embroiled in ridicule.
And successful acts such as 'Cabaret' or 'Les Misérables' have had an air of mystery about them.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment at the Mogador has changed all that.
Today, these two stages are churning out performances like hits.
The former is reprising its excellent 'My Fair Lady' this Christmas and has announced the worldwide production of 'Un Américain à Paris' as a follow-up.
At the Mogador, 'La Belle et la Bête' could well be one of the successes of the season.
On other stages, musicals such as '1789: les Amants de la Bastille' and small productions such as 'Disco' or 'Life and Times' are falling in step with the success and quality recorded so far.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book 'Histoires de comédies musicales' and speaker at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for the hard-won success.
How are French musicals evolving?
The choice is growing.
Firstly there are the "musical shows" that evolve according to the will of the producers...
Some use lovely projections of images and a true story, such as '1789: les Amants de la Bastille'.
Others leap backwards fifteen years, under the pretext that you can put on pretty much whatever you want when you have Matt Pokora heading the bill.
Then there are the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet, which allow us to bring the golden age of Broadway back to life and rediscover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest composer alive.
Stage Entertainment popularizes variety English musicals by adapting them into French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But projects under way such as 'Rent', 'Le Baiser de la Femme Araignée' or 'L'Éveil du Printemps' are having trouble finding finances.
Do we have enough artists capable of singing, acting and dancing, as on Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musicals in a season, then it's a good year.
We have 200 talented artists who move from project to project.
In the United States, the cradle of the musical, it is very different.
Young actors are trained in these skills in numerous schools.
There are numerous jobs in regional theatres, touring companies, Broadway, off Broadway etc.
The breeding ground for talent is as sizable as the number of roles available.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the provinces remain the poor relative of culture in France.
Few theatrical productions go on tour and most of them are usually "boulevard theatre", intended for adults, not adolescents.
Musicals fill that gap.
These are the same young people that love reality television and the ephemeral stars it produces...
Offering good-looking (often talented) young men a leading role in a musical guarantees the adoration of young girls and often their entire family.
Facebook pages for these shows are skillfully managed by professionals who answer questions.
The shows are eagerly expected by the time they reach a provincial Zénith (theatre).
The musicals are prepared in Paris and enjoyed in the provinces.
The show is designed to be staged in any major theatre in France in the same format as in Paris.
