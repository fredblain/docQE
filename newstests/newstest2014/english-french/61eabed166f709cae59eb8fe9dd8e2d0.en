Tenants have to go and vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 a month in the cost of their accommodation that goes to the City in taxes.
If the owner pays $5000 in municipal taxes, he divides this figure between each house.
We are forced to increase the rent to help us pay the new taxes.
By going to vote, we are sending a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates have told us that they would tackle this scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay $100,000 for fireworks, $4-5 million for land just in case...
Go and vote, that is the best way to express yourself and say enough is enough.
