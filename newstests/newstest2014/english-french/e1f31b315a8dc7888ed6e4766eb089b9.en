Menton Reduces Cost of Christmas Lights
With 420 patterned designs and 2.2 kilometers of seafront draped in a mantle of light, the bill for the illuminations in Menton could give you a bit of a shock.
What's more, unlike in many communes, the bill is met by taxpayers rather than by business associations.
The town has decided to use LEDs to reduce costs.
There has also been a change in the management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
