Vatican Poll on Contraception, Divorce and Homosexuality
The Vatican is to carry out a large-scale poll across the world on the way in which parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorces and same-sex couples.
The poll will ask participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage bonds.
The poll was sent out to every national conference of bishops in mid-October, with instructions to secure as many responses as possible.
The information will be used at a major assembly on the family that Pope Francis is planning to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesperson for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way in which to approach parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops have published the poll on the Internet and asked Catholics to participate.
