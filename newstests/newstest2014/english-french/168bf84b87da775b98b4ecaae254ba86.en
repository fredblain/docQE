One Seriously Injured in Accident with Wrong Way Driver on Brussels Ring Road
A road accident on the Brussels inner ring road near Hoeilaart in the direction of Waterloo at 5.30am on Friday morning left one person seriously injured.
The car driven by the injured woman was hit by a driver who was travelling in the wrong direction and came out unhurt.
The section of the ring road where the accident occurred was closed to traffic until 9am for the road to be cleared and for an expert to establish the circumstances of the accident.
This situation, however, did not create traffic jam as the accident happened at the exit of Hoeilaart.
Traffic was therefore diverted via the exit/entrance to the ring road.
