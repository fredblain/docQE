Disney to Launch New Animated Series on Tablet PCs
American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to give priority to tablet PCs over its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the site watchdisneyjunior.com or via its application for mobile phones and tablets.
The global launch on the Disney group channels is not planned until 2014, according to the press release from its Disney Junior division.
The animation, aimed at children aged 2 to 7, is about the adventures of the cat, Callie, the sheriff of a town in the Wild West where she keeps law and order using a magic lasso.
Each episode contains two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature for children today," notes Albert Cheng, vice-president of digital products at the Disney/ABC Television Group, in a quote in the press release.
This kind of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifetime of its series and build new relationships with audiences via digital platforms that are becoming ever more important," he added.
A survey published by Common Sense Media at the beginning of the week showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 already use a tablet or mobile phone, and 72% of under 8s, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
