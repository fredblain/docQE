Woman Tries Smuggling 2kg of Cocaine Inside Pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to smuggle two kilos of cocaine hidden inside pumpkins into the country through Montreal-Trudeau Airport on Thursday morning.
The drugs were detected when passenger luggage was checked.
The cocaine was split between three pumpkins that had been previously hollowed out.
The drugs were subsequently taken to the office of the Royal Gendarmerie of Canada (GRC), which then took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman had been travelling from when she was intercepted.
"That is part of the investigation," indicated Jacqueline Roby, spokesperson for the CBSA.
"What I can tell you is that she was entering the country."
Since the start of 2013, the Canada Border Services Agency at Montreal-Trudeau Airport has conducted 173 drugs seizures, of which 10 involved seizures of cocaine totaling 44 kilograms.
In 2012 the Border Services Agency for the province of Quebec made 1,653 seizures of narcotics.
