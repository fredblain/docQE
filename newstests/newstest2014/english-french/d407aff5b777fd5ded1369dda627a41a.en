Delta Centre-Ville Closes
Delta Centre-Ville Hotel in Montreal closed its doors on Thursday after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will convert it into student residences.
The hotel had three hundred and fifty employees.
Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta has promised not to abandon its employees.
Employers have come to meet employees on site and have met with the employees individually to assess their needs.
"That support will continue for the next six months," explains the regional labour relations director at Delta hotels, Felix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta comes at a time of great competitiveness in the hotel market.
The investment fund that owned the building had to make a choice.
It had to either reinvest in the building to continue using it, which would require investments worth tens of millions of dollars while competition is fierce as a lot of new hotels have appeared in Montreal.
or sell it to someone else, which is what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Chair in Tourism at the School of Management at the UQAM.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a home for the elderly.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling almost 600 rooms will be implemented in the next two years.
