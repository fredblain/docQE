The Wolf of Wall Street: Second Trailer Released
Martin Scorsese has released footage from his next film in which the title role, an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget being sensible and grab your ticket.
Leonardo DiCaprio will take your breath away in his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us a true story about a "Long Island stockbroker who refuses to collaborate with the authorities over a massive corruption scheme on Wall Street".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort embarks on a scam that would make him a very rich man.
We see his meteoric rise, but also the vertiginous fall that follows.
Out of control, he indulges in parties, women and drugs.
Decadence and excesses of all sorts are the key words in this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio duo seems to have rediscovered the magic that brought them together in Shutter Island.
The new Scorsese release is late because the editing has taken longer than planned.
Apparently, the final version of the film will last 2 hours 45 minutes.
Due in theatres December 25, its release will come just right in time for the Oscars.
