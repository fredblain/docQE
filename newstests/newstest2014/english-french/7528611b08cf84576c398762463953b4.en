Repainted Traffic Lights: MP Asks Brigitte Grouwels to Resign
Not everyone is pleased with Minister Brigitte Grouwels' plan to give traffic light posts in Brussels a "face-lift".
The Minister of Public Works and Transports in Brussels had launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday, consisting in repainting 16 traffic light posts in the yellow and blue colours of the Brussels region.
The aim of this is to both "increase safety" and "enhance the identity of Brussels".
The idea is to eventually repaint all the traffic lights in Brussels, at an estimated cost of one million Euros.
But the blue chosen by the Minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who talks of the "Flemishing" of the capital and is demanding the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content with spending Brussels residents' money like water on this scheme of giving traffic light posts a face-lift with the colours of the Brussels region, Brigitte Grouwels is continuing her efforts to turn the capital Flemish," says an angry De Bock in a press release.
After her mango yellow and black taxis, she has ended up repainting the posts in Brussels yellow, dark blue and black.
According to the MP, there is now "no difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels.
The residents of Brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a Christian Democratic and Flemish Minister, who is carrying out the New Flemish Alliance program herself.
It is high time the Flemish Trojan Horse was stopped.
Let's not forget, Brigitte Grouwels was elected by 2,245 votes, that is 0.5% of Brussels inhabitants!" De Bock concludes.
