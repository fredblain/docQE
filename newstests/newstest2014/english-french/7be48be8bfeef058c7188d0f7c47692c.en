NSA Spying: The United States "went too far," Kerry admits
The United States sometimes went "too far" with its espionage activities, Secretary of State John Kerry recognised in the first admission from Washington, which is deep in controversy with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that an official of the American government has explicitly admitted controversial activities in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In certain cases, I acknowledge, as does the President, that some of these activities went too far and we guarantee that this will not happen in the future," declared John Kerry at a conference in London that he was participating in from Washington via a video link on Thursday October 31.
In his relayed speech, and in the presence of his British counterpart, William Hague, the head of the American diplomatic service justified at length the intelligence practices and collection of data as part of the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Citing the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had since thwarted numerous planned attacks thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of data.
"We have prevented planes being brought down, buildings being blown up and people being murdered, because we have been able to stay informed prior to these attacks," the head of the American diplomatic service argued.
Furthermore, John Kerry stated in his address to the Europeans, "I assure you that no innocent person has been misled during this process."
Yet America strives to collate data.
"Yes, in certain cases, this went too far in an inappropriate manner," the Secretary of State again admitted, having already had to make a statement on the international scandal during a tour in Paris, London and Rome last week.
On Thursday evening, he asserted that President Obama had "resolved to try to clarify the matter and had initiated a re-examination of these practices to ensure that no-one felt misled".
But the controversy between the Americans and Europeans continued to grow this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA has been intercepting data of hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which quotes documents obtained by the former NSA consultant, Edward Snowden, stated that the programme dubbed "MUSCULAR" and conducted in conjunction with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, enabled the two agencies to gather data from the fibre-optic cables used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items were collected during the month of January alone - ranging from meta data on emails to text elements or audio and video files.
These interceptions apparently took place outside the USA.
However, Yahoo and Google have denied any involvement in these practices.
For ten days now, a number of major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have been revealing that the NSA had intercepted massive quantities of data and communications emanating from allies of the United States and their leaders, in particular the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Following the outrage of the European states, and even though leaks to the American press stated that the American President was not up-to-date with these spying activities, Barack Obama has refused to comment on the matter, citing national security.
On the other hand, the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even pointed the finger back at the European intelligence services who allegedly got hold of these communications before passing them on to the NSA.
This concerned "military operations" in countries where the NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and this absolutely did not target Europe, according to General Alexander.
The discord spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network, which has also aroused the ire of China.
