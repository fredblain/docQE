French Police to Arrest Anderlecht Supporters Not Travelling in RSCA Buses
The French police have decided to impose strict rules ahead of the match between Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht and Paris Saint-Germain, set for Thursday, Marie Verbeke, spokesperson for the Brussels-South police district, said on Friday.
Belgian supporters of RSCA who want to travel to the Champions League match will have to use the transportation system provided by RSCA.
"The convoy of buses will be escorted by the police from a former frontier post at Rekem to the PSG stadium," said the spokesperson.
The arrangement will be the same on the way back.
"If other supporters are intending to travel to Paris by other means, the French Police Department has said that steps have been taken to permit arrests to be made and people to be taken into custody," Marie Verbeke also announced.
