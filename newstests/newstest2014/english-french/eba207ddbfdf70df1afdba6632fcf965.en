Rehousing Due to Rats Causes Strife in La Seyne
At the start of this week, a family abandoned its ground floor apartment in building Fructidor D2 because of the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office offered to provide exceptional, provisional rehousing for the couple and their three children in a new four-room house.
However, the family refused "for financial reasons" and the situation is at stalemate.
"The matter has become exaggerated," thinks JoÃ«l Canapa, office director.
"There have always been rats in towns.
The rat extermination company conducts two operations per year. Furthermore, we intervene at our own cost whenever there is a complaint from residents.
Hence we have carried out 64 operations since last winter.
The area has not been abandoned and rats are not swarming into the town.
Due to environmental protection and public health concerns, rat extermination products are four times less efficient than in the past, but we are not going to kill a kid for the sake of two rats."
"We didn't invite the rats in," counters the father of the family, which left its home and moved into a hotel.
"We will soon be penniless and we are waiting for a new house at the same rate as the old one."
