Five years ago, my father passed away.
At first, I was in denial about his death. I spoke of him in the present tense.
I was afraid of forgetting him, or perhaps I did not know how I was going to continue to "spend time" with him.
There is no formula, no method for passing through the wall of the invisible to be with your loved ones.
Then signs started to appear.
The first time I had this very strong feeling of his presence, he was in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time is when I quietly woke up in the middle of the night and went to look at his watch, which I always have with me, lying on the bedside table.
The smiling image of my father stays with me during my everyday activities.
Our mother left us after an exhausting fight against cancer.
At least, that is what I thought when I saw the shell of her stiff body under the crumpled sheets of the hospital bed.
Similarly, her funeral was a cold goodbye focused on the dim light of the candles surrounding her coffin.
I thought she had gone.
Gradually, by way of tiny and slightly faint or faded appearances during the day and night, she soon came back into my life, evolving as she took back her place in the landscape of my mind which thought it was still in mourning.
And then she revealed herself by showing me aspects of myself I had never seen before, that were hidden by my relationship with her.
Thus, I learnt and understood that I had not lost my mother herself at all, just a woman that I did not know very well, a woman who embodied her during her stay on this earth.
In dying, this woman had completed her life and freed the person that I loved, and now she was back, whole and complete.
This detour in the path of my life is still the most unexpected and beautiful thing.
It is a privilege to know that the people we love never leave us.
I am like my father, "inside and out", it seems.
I have always been told that.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he became old and ill.
At that point I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he stayed with me - when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was ill...
He would speak to me, constantly encourage me, he lived in my body.
I would see his hands when I looked at mine; I lent him my body.
But this was never indiscreet.
I could still lead a personal life.
He allowed me my privacy.
That lasted a long time, then one day he was gone.
In the end, it felt comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who it was that said that those who die are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer here but I feel them close to me constantly.
In every event, every moment of my life, I feel their presence, and I am always referring to them: what would they say, what would they think, what would they do?
I constantly dream of them, perhaps not every night, but several times a week for sure.
I often dream of the last moments I shared with them before it was too late, except that there is still one thing that prevents me from enjoying the moment.
I often wake up distressed because it hits me and I feel their absence deeply.
Sometimes, some dreams affect me differently and make an impression on my mind, so, in effect, they continue to live and be a part of my life.
On the day before my ultrasound, when I was going to find out the gender of my baby, I dreamt that I woke up and hauled myself out of bed, and my father was waiting for me on the landing. He was smiling at me and was happy that I was expecting a little boy.
The following day, I had the feeling that he had come to visit me in my dream to tell me that he was sharing the joy I was feeling.
And, yes, I was indeed carrying a boy.
I loved sharing that moment with him and enjoy talking of that shared memory that happened after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
One year previously, she had travelled with my family to Cuba.
Hence the shock that her loss provoked in the young graduate I was then.
In spite of everything, I said my goodbyes fairly quickly.
But she continues to influence my life, particularly in when I'm going through hard times, or when I have to make an important decision.
Deciding to learn Arabic and pursuing an interest in the Middle East, to the point of doing a Masters at a major university, in hindsight, were not trivial decisions.
Actually, I often used to listen to her speak Arabic during my childhood and talk about Morocco where she had lived for decades before coming back to France when it became independent.
The values she instilled in me are still there, so I often end up wondering what she would want me to do at a given moment.
It's the same with my opinions: I try to live up to the generosity and correctness of her mind as a fervent believer.
Nowadays I feel her as a daily presence, a benevolent force, a saving spirit.
I see her eyes resting on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
She died after talking to me on the telephone.
I went through all the stages: incomprehension, anger, grief, tears that would come on their own, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, at incongruous moments.
But time eased the pain.
Now there is just the gap, the silent emptiness, the need for her to entrust me, to reassure me in the palm of her gentleness.
Yet, she is there, a silent presence, watching me.
Every morning I see her worried eyes looking at me, I see the dark rings giving her a burdened look, the wrinkles around the lips dug by cigarettes, the lines that mark the forehead on days of worry.
My mother has taken possession of my face, and every morning she looks back at me in the mirror.
And every morning, I look away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43.
We always feel her protecting us, nothing bad will happen to us.
This was her promise on her death bed; so, gradually, we learnt to smile again, and saying her name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her at the dead of night when the absence hurts too much, and she comes into my dreams when my spirits are a little low.
We feel supported and protected in difficult moments, and the passage of time has made us realise that she was the conductor, with us trying to stay on the path she had drawn for us.
If somebody truly loved you, their absence cannot tear them out your heart or your memories.
In a way, the person you loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 to asbestos-related cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he would have thought or would have appreciated.
I was unable to attend his burial, and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
Sometimes my beliefs are different from his, so I am always asking myself if what I am doing conforms with his way of seeing things.
I have even had problems at work because of these convictions.
However, I can't do otherwise; I lose sleep and constantly ask myself what he would think.
I don't know if I have adopted his way of thinking or if I am simply like him - is it genetic?
Whatever the case, he will always be my point of reference.
He was a bit like an alter ego, we didn't even need to speak.
In short, he is there every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
Almost thirty years ago, my husband died aged 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6.
The immense pain that engulfed me has eased of course, but he is still close to me.
He very often "turns up" in my dreams, in a very specific way, so vivid that when I wake up I am sad again when I realise that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me how I was; I said not good, and he said "I'm coming down", but in a voice so real that I woke up with a start, upset, and I switched on the bedside lamp and looked around, convinced that he would come.
I still live in the same house and, frequently, I feel he is watching me; I turn round and see he isn't there, but I know it's him and I talk to him.
I feel his presence in every room and it makes me happy.
I wouldn't leave this house for anything in the world. We were happy here and his spirit lives here with me.
I'm 58 and I have always lived alone since losing him. He is and will remain the love of my life.
I should say that I am rather sociable and have a job with responsibilities. I laugh and sing, I go out, I'm a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him. I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
