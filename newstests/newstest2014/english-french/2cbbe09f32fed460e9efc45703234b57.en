NSA Affair Emphasizes Complete Lack of Debate on Intelligence
Why the contradictory attitude of the French government? On the one hand, it publicly takes offence and summons the Ambassador of the United States on October 21 and, on the other, it forbids the Bolivian president's plane to enter its air space on the basis of a rumor that Edward Snowden was on board?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When Fran√ßois Hollande telephones Barack Obama, or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the Ambassador of the United States, they are responding to a real discovery, that of the scale of America's surveillance of communications within France generally.
And is it not surprising to read in the pages of Le Monde, on the one hand, a reproduction of diplomatic correspondence with the US and, on the other, condemnation of the NSA's spying on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Quai d'Orsay, within a matter of weeks?
Is there not an element of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic method is not to adopt a moral position, but to investigate the significance and relevance of information and enable every citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks reveals the American administration's monitoring of political and other matters somewhere in the world, we consider this to be significant enlightenment with regard to the American government.
In describing the American methods of data interception in relation to the French diplomatic representation in the United States, we do not aim at expressing indignation about this practice, but rather at describing the world as it is.
Has France benefited from the intelligence supplied by the NSA concerning terrorist operations against our interests?
Can we do without collaboration with the Americans?
The setting up of high-performance interception technology over practically the past ten years by the United States - and by France - has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Furthermore, in this regard, France and the United States in particular have implemented procedures, sometimes described as essential, for cooperating and exchanging information on an almost daily basis.
For example, France was informed of the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas of Miranshah through the NSA's resources.
Also France may, for example, have to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the Americans and, in return - as already briefly mentioned - the Americans may provide information to the French about other parts of the world.
Hence the question at the heart of the NSA affair is not so much the capacity or the right of a country to use interception tools, as the issue of the complete lack of prior debate - especially within parliaments - on the justification of such systems, the extent to which they should be used and, ultimately, the issue of the infringement of freedoms.
What risk does the United States actually run? Ruining its image?
However much we denounce the US, I see no way in which it can be punished.
The risk run by the Americans could be twofold.
The first is when their allies - as has been the case recently - learn that their governments have been spied on, sometimes at the highest level.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States are strained.
Another effect could be more commercial: in the light of the revelations, more and more European and South American countries are balking at the idea of entrusting their confidential data to American providers that are subject to American law and hence to the grips of the NSA.
Finally, the widespread exercise in revelations conducted by the media across the world, which is contributing to the establishment of a debate on surveillance practices by intelligence services that have been almost invisible until now, could force legislators - including those of America - to reconsider the powers they have granted their intelligence agencies.
