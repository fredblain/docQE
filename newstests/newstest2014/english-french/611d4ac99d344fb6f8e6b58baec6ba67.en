"Plan to buy Goodyear Amiens will begin with zero employees," Titan CEO says
After dramatically throwing in the towel in January over the partial taking over of the Goodyear site in Amiens North, which is due to close, Maurice Taylor, CEO of American tire manufacturer, Titan, now says that he is ready to save 333 of the factory's 1,137 employees.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Industrial Recovery, had already announced this on Monday October 21.
After giving up the plan to buy the factory in January, today you are back.
You had fired violent attacks and insults, talking of 'so-called workers' who 'work three hours' a day, and 'mad' unions, targeting the CGT.
It's hard to understand this U-turn.
Is this meant to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who is trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs.
I'm sorry if my words have offended anyone.
But there are high levels of tax and unemployment in France too.
Does the truth offend you?
Working seven hours a day when people in other countries are working eight hours is holding France back.
In India, China and many other countries, people work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I don't have prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory which manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, a good location and plenty of room for growth.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, if the price is right and the workers are qualified, it's worth trying.
What sort of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If Goodyear had offered the employees a good severance package after announcing that the factory was closing, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys a closed factory from Goodyear.
At that point, Titan could choose to move the machinery to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the factory in Amiens with at least 333 well-paid employees.
Titan has agreed to recruit them from the 1,200 or so people currently working for Goodyear.
Also, Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit down with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay for all the employees.
Then there won't be any employees left in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg has said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Can you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he would like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I said to you, the CGT and Goodyear must first reach an agreement on the severance pay.
If all the employees accept it, the project of buying Goodyear Amiens will begin with zero employees.
How can we give guarantees on the length of employment when there are no employees left on site?
If Mr. Montebourg gets the CGT and Goodyear to reach an agreement and Titan buys the factory, we have every intention of staying in Amiens North for more than four years.
