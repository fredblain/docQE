End of the Road for Elysée Head Chef
Having entered the 500m2-space of the kitchens at the Elysée Palace as an assistant after working in embassies, the cook climbed up the ladder to become head chef nine years ago.
He has served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande, including at their holiday homes, and fed an uncountable number of world figures, surrounded by a cloud of anonymity that he has only emerged from today, as he retires at 60.
Born on 24 October 1953 in La Ferté-Saint-Aubin, the man with an open face, a balding head and the glasses of an intellectual is the holder of a certificate of professional competence in confectionery.
His mother was a cook in a château in Sologne.
"I've moved from one château to another!" says Bernard Vaussion ironically. He is familiar, not only with the habits of the six presidents for whom he has cooked, but also with those of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It's always the Head of State or his partner or wife who chooses the menu," he recalls.
"Madame Chirac was a little more involved and would come right into the kitchen," to the point where she forbade women to enter the kitchens in the Elysée Palace!
With all due respect to heads of state who appeared relatively indifferent to fruits of the earth, "they are all fond of food" Bernard Vaussion reveals graciously.
Jacques Chirac certainly had a "more refined palate".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who forbade cheese, the plates always came back empty!
François Hollande, who reintroduced cheese, is "a man who likes to eat" and "he is not very choosy".
The current Head of State, who has put back on the pounds he lost during the presidential campaign, does "not have a specific diet requirement".
Bernard Vaussion also recalls the pressure that would rest on his shoulders, especially during state dinners at the Elysée, where one had to serve "between 200 and 250 people in around an hour".
The night before would be practically sleepless.
Such people would not understand if something went wrong.
The now former head chef at the Elysée, who shared a drink on Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, is leaving with a twinge of sorrow. "François Hollande came to say goodbye."
He was full of praise.
"His human side came out," he recalls.
The chef will be replaced by his assistant, 35-year-old Guillaume Gomez, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years himself.
