Coen Brothers' Homage to Folk Music
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, winners of the Grand Prix at the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic comedy set in Greenwich Village in 1961 and based on folk music, which was just budding there prior to the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has recently been the subject of a review at the "Cinémathèque française", scooped the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 with Barton Fink.
Since they could not hire Dylan or the Peter, Paul and Mary trio, Joel and Ethan Coen opted for a rising American movie star, Oscar Isaac, aged 33, and global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this film bursting with humour, where the music is a central character and the songs are performed live, Oscar Isaac proved himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, abandons pop for folk music with contagious glee.
Carey Mulligan, in turn, abandons the wealthy trappings of Daisy Buchanan in "The Great Gatsby" for less glitzy clothes; her singing voice is soft, but her language very coarse when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells the story of a week of tribulations for a folk singer who has failed to get a break and is angry with the whole world.
He reluctantly accepts last minute stand-in roles at studios.
With nowhere to live, he sleeps on the couches of friends who will still have him.
Documentary-style
"His relationship with success is tortured, and that's what interested us: a mix of bad luck and a guy who's never in the right place at the right time, not career-orientated, but honest, with a tendency towards self-destruction," Ethan Coen, who, with his brother Joel, has won several Oscars and Cannes prizes, told the press.
Even though Llewyn Davis never existed, the two directors, who are folk music fans, based their story on real people of the time, such as folk musician Dave Van Ronk.
The idea was to portray the moment preceding the advent of Greenwich Village, the New York district destined to become "the epicentre of the folk music boom that created international stars", according to the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk.
The film has the feel of a documentary, from the fusty record label overrun with unsold LPs and inhabited by a priceless old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the day and the cafés where the singers performed.
The Coen brothers' magic continues to work by integrating a comical character who is permanently on screen: a magnificent, cute ginger cat who is Llewyn Davis' companion in fate.
Asked how he had developed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled how he "grew up in Tennessee, bathed in the blues and country music".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather. He taught me to play the guitar," he added.
Timberlake says that although you have to work "to be considered good...luck can also launch your career...more and more so today".
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star says that in a career, "the most important thing is to avoid getting trapped by things that prevent us from expressing ourselves".
