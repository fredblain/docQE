Horse in Beef Products
Horse meat has been detected in beef-based canned food products sold by two small British low-cost distribution retailers, the Food Standards Agency announced today.
Routine tests revealed that products processed in Romania in January and sold by shops of the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains contained between 1 and 5% of horse DNA.
"Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in prepared meals had broken out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to investigations by the European Commission, France the most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products which are supposed to contain beef only.
