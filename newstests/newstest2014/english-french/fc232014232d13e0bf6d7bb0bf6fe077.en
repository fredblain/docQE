Vettel Uses New Special Helmet in Abu Dhabi
Lucky winner Jake Vite Prekop combined the colours of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat on the track.
German driver, Sebastian Vettel, quadruple Formula 1 World Champion, wore a special new helmet designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan during the free practice sessions for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday.
Vettel chose the winning entry from 1,500 designs sent in from all over the world as part of a competition run by one of the sponsors, a car brand in his stable.
The winner was invited to the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi with a friend and was able to get up close to the German champion, both on the track and in the pits.
Vettel was expected to wear the helmet in the practice sessions on Friday and Saturday.
He will probably have another special helmet for the race on Sunday designed to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
