Oracle Shareholders Angry at Ellison Salary
A majority of shareholders at Oracle voted against the proposed remuneration package for founder and managing director Larry Ellison on Thursday in view of his group's financial performance.
The vote is not binding, but it does tarnish the image of Ellison, the third richest man in the world, who is still revelling in his boat's victory in the Americas Cup.
The multimillionaire still holds 25% of the capital in the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Just last year, Ellison got a negative vote on his remuneration package.
The Oracle boss relinquished a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 financial year, which ended in May, because of the group's poor performances. The group had failed to meet its growth targets, but he did pick up around $77 million linked to stock options.
His fixed salary is a nominal $1.
Throughout the non-calendar 2013 fiscal year, Oracle's net profit grew by 3.5%, while its share price rose 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which grew 24% in the same period.
