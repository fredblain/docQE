House Engulfed in Flames in Old Quebec
A fire that started at midday on Friday in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than thirty firemen rushed to 9 Rue HÃ©bert.
The fire started in a three-apartment house on four floors, situated behind the yard of the Quebec Seminary.
All the tenants were out when the fire started.
The fire was brought under control an hour after the firemen who arrived in their numbers to intervene.
As soon as the first firemen arrived, they could clearly see the smoke.
"The alarms went off one after the other as it took reinforcements to deal with the building, because the buildings here are close together," explained France Loiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec fire service.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of the fire.
