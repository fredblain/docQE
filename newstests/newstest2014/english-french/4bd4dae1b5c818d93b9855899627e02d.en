Worker Dies Buried Under Concrete Blocks
A construction worker died after being buried under dozens of concrete blocks in Montreal on Thursday afternoon.
The tragedy occurred at around 11am on Rue Marquette, near the junction with Rue Beaubien, in the district of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
By all accounts, foundation work had been going on at the site for some time.
A shared foundation wall had just been erected in the past few days.
The accident occurred just after the victim had arrived on site to collect his tools.
"I was going past in my car when I saw the wall collapse, creating a huge cloud of dust," said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the site.
"I got out and went to remove the large blocks that were covering him.
Only part of his back was visible, it's really sad."
According to the authorities, the victim is a man in his fifties, who worked for a formwork company.
Attempts at resuscitation were made by the emergency services, but without success.
The man succumbed to his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was dispatched to the site to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
