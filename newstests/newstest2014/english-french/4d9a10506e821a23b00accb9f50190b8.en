Hagel Accuses 9 US States of Violating Homosexual Rights
Since the Federal government recognised same-sex marriage, "all spouses of military officers have a right to an identity card from the Department of Defense and to the associated benefits," said the Secretary of Defense in New York, in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League for the fight against anti-Semitism.
"However, some states have refused to issue these cards to same sex spouses in facilities of the National Guard" set up in their region, he criticised, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, such individuals cannot take advantage of numerous social or healthcare services in these bases, or access the shops of the latter.
The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure that federal law was implemented.
The refusal by the nine states started with Texas, which refused to implement these measures in Texan National Guard facilities due to a conflict between Texan law and the federal law on same-sex marriage.
Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, followed in refusal, according to a senior Defense official.
The Pentagon estimates that the population concerned by the recognition of same-sex marriage involves about 5,600 active individuals, or 17,000 if the National Guard, the reserve and retired people are included.
