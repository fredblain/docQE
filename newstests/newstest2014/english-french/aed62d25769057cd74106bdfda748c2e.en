Pitcairn to Create World's Largest Marine Reserve
Pitcairn Island is aiming to create the largest marine reserve in the world, daily newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti announced on Thursday, following up on news from Radio Australia.
The island, which lies to the east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
The territory measures 47km2, including three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation by the Bounty mutineers, an episode in British maritime history that has been turned into three Hollywood films.
Several dozen inhabitants, the majority of them descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live on Pitcairn, with 95% of their income depending on the generosity of London.
The island's Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the tiny archipelago. It will be 836,000km2, corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
An assistant to the mayor went to London to ask Great Britain to endorse this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected zone would be the first step towards greater financial autonomy for the island.
The project will need to be ratified by the British governor of Pitcairn, who is based in New Zealand, and the British government.
Creating such a reserve would permit the United Kingdom to protect the 836,000km2, provided it has the means to ensure it is policed - which it does not.
There is no airport on Pitcairn, making it impossible to base one or more aircrafts there to monitor the zone, and there is no port where military surveillance crafts can be placed.
France, on her part, already has to carry out the highly expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of 5 million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, adjacent to Pitcairn.
