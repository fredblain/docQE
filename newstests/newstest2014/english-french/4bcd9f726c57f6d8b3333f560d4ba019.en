Palestinians and Israelis Clash on Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on the evening of 31 October 2013 during a violent clash on the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped working on Friday 1 November, following exhaustion of its fuel reserve, the Energy Authority for the Palestinian enclave announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another officer of the armed wing of Hamas, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell during an incursion by the Israeli army east of Khan Younes, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officers of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armoured bulldozer made an incursion a hundred metres or so into the territory before retreating.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesperson, Sami Abou Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and stated that Israeli soldiers had died in the confrontation.
Hamas praised the "Al-Qassam heroes who died defending the territory against an incursion at Khan Younes by the Zionist occupier.
Many enemies were killed or injured during the operation.
Hamas guarantees that Gaza will be hell for the occupier," the spokesperson threatened.
The Israeli army, on the other hand, stated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, which was discovered on 7 October and, according to the army, was intended for "terrorist activities".
Hamas has defended its use of tunnels in the fight against Israel, stating that the aim was to capture Israeli soldiers so they could be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military statement.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting the "Tsahal forces" (the Israeli army) and injured five soldiers.

"This mission was essential because of the risk of the terrorist tunnel being used for attacks against Israeli civilians," said army spokesperson, Peter Lerner.
Furthermore, Israel attacked a military airbase in the northwest of Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported on Thursday 31 October.
A US official confirmed that there had been an "Israeli strike", but did not give details of the target.
"In the past, the targets have been missiles being transferred to Hezbollah," he merely added.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information relating to the attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it did not name, the Saudi-owned channel stated that "the bombing targeted a shipment of ground-to-air missiles intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that is fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions being heard at dawn on Wednesday in a defence airbase at Sonar Jable, near Lattaquie, on the Syrian coast.
This organisation, which relies on a network of militants and medical sources, was unable to identify the origin of the explosions.
