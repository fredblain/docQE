Drone Kills Pakistani Taliban Leader
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an American drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, according to security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times before in the past.
However, intelligence personnel, army staff and political activists have confirmed this time that he has lost his life in the strike, which was carried out in the region of North Waziristan.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud has been killed in a drone strike," said a senior security services official.
The previous day, the Pakistani Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, informed the British government on a trip to London that discussions had been initiated with Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
