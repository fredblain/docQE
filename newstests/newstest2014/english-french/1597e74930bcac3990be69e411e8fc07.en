CGR Theatre in Narbonne Evacuated on Thursday Evening
The first showing of a film at the Mega CGR theatre in Narbonne was interrupted on Thursday evening out of precaution after viewers reported a tingling sensation in the throat.
The theatre director immediately began an evacuation procedure and called the fire brigade to check out a suspicious smell.
Around 70 people were evacuated from the viewing.
They were examined, and a thorough check of the cinema revealed nothing.
Was it a bad joke involving tear gas?
Or was it an involuntary incident?
Either way, the management of the theatre decided to implement the principle of precaution and put the safety of its customers first.
The cinema was ventilated and everyone returned in good order.
The cinema was able to show itself in a good light and the customers could continue enjoying events unfolding...
but, on the screen only.
