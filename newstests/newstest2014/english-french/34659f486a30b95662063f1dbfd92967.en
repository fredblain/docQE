Pierre Nora's Two Frances
Perplexed by his work, academics have long struggled to define and place Pierre Nora.
Is he a professor in lecture halls and classrooms?
Of course, but with emphasis on his fondness for byroads, at Sciences-Po (French Institute of Political Sciences), and Hautes Etudes (School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences).
Does he play an arbiter of the work of others from his office in Rue Gaston-Gallimard?
Yes, but while ignoring his lesser known work and underground writing as an editor.
Is he the heir to Fontenelle's chair at the Académie Française?
Yes again, but he knows that such an honour cannot replace the real holy oil, the philosophical work, which he has foregone.
They have gladly acknowledged him as a great awakener, a driving force, a unifier of their work, but observed that he seemed disinclined to produce such work himself.
The monumental "Lieux de mémoire" (places of memory), to which his name is attached, has also contributed to this unclear image.
Scandal-mongers have regarded this work as a gigantic "flea market", presented by an intelligent and very learned commentator with a keen eye, but who is an incurable "dabbler".
The two works published by Nora almost two years ago have already proven that though he appeared not to write, he had written - plentifully and well.
This book should definitively do him justice.
However, once again, there is a tendency towards ubiquity, intellectual roaming, jubilation in jumping, as if with both feet tied,from one subject to another.
Nevertheless, one quickly understands that the disparate objects gathered together in this beautifully titled book lead the "second-hand goods dealer" to a constant passion, that of discovering the core that makes up the French identity.
Why these dramatic appeals for national unity?
Identity is a contemporary preoccupation.
Not long ago, we were asked to collectively define it.
But, in the peremptory minds of our former leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
All it took was to highlight its mistakes and, in keeping with Jacobinism, the issue would be entrusted to prefects and sub-prefects - the authorised interpreters.
What Pierre Nora is searching for is something else.
He does not position himself as an heir to an eternal Frenchness; he rejects the definition.
As an analyst anxious about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stops after each step to examine an object in the form of a puzzle, tormented by irritating questions,
such as this, which arises from the undertaking itself: why, in a country so permanently established within its frontiers, with such an ancient structure and that is so solidly built, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
The calls are pressing only because of the need to ward off the trouble caused by discord in French history, says Nora.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division in this country are very ancient.
And the most emblematic is clearly that which split national history in two:
since the upheaval of the Revolution, the French have had two histories and two nations - one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second tried to kill off the first, but failed to wipe it out; on the contrary, it was wary of letting it rediscover its sacredness and was so eager for unity and indivisibility that it cut off the head of the person who was the evident and powerful incarnation of the two.
And from there was born an invincibly bipartite nation, split into left and right, lay and Catholic, adoration and hatred for the Revolution.
To understand this unique aspect of the French identity, there is nothing better than taking a short trip outside of metropolitan France, so much so that Pierre Nora's American venture could be the heart of his book.
This is because America and France have both had a revolution, drawn up a declaration of rights, and tried to found a new society.
However, our familiarity with America only emphasises even more something that is particular to us.
Over there, people abandoned their former rulers in England and did not have to bother about them any more.
Here, people were bothered by a native old power, and were all the more radical for it.
Over there, the revolution was consensual, whereas here it engendered tragedy and conflict.
There, the founding fathers are still honoured, but here, our revolutionary ancestors are hardly used as role models, besides, they killed each other.
There, there has been institutional consistency; here there has been a torrent of constitutions, so many mistakes to correct and tests to repeat:
the France on the way out, the France in the making.
However, there has been a time when the French believed they could repair the damage done to their history and overcome the curse of the number two.
Pierre Nora has shown has shown great interest and even tenderness for this Third Republic: he salutes those who tried at the time to repair the divide created by the Revolution by teaching students about everything in the former France that obscurely paved the way for the modern France, and by offering them a unified version of their history.
Yet, this pacified identity has had its day.
Here we are in debate once again, shaken by a new type of immigration, threatened by the inflow of protesting minorities, absorbed into the European framework.
The book thus offers both a fascinating portrait of the France on the way out, and a circumspect outline of the France in the making.
And, on top of that, there is the portrait of the historian, which should hold some surprises.
It reveals that the wanderer liked to stay at home.
The man of many curiosities is - slightly obsessively - focused on a single idea.
The one who prowled at the edges was standing in the heart of the centre.
And the man who rejected a notion of a nation over half a century ago, but who escaped from the initiatory exercise of the philosophical work, confides in us, cum grano salis, that he has ended up doing it after all.
And so he has, but in a less formal, and more exploded and subtle form.
A form, which - make no mistake - is just as restrictive,
because, over and above the format imposed in the university course, this philosophical work speaks of the inner necessity of a life.
