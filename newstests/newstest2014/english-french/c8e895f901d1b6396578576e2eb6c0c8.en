Unknown Persons Open Fire on Hotel Near Pyramids in Cairo
Unknown persons wearing hoods opened fire on a hotel close to the pyramids in Cairo, Egypt this Friday. Nobody was hurt in the incident which apparently resulted from an argument involving workers who had been made redundant.
The attackers fled, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, Police General Abdel Latif.
The attack took place at a time when Egypt is hardly receiving any tourists since the army deposed the Islamic President, Mohamed Morsi, in early July and bloodily suppresses demonstrations by his supporters.
