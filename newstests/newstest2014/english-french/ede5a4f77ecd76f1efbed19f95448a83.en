Life Sentence for Former Chinese Vice-Governor
A former vice-governor of the province of Jilin, in the northeast of China, sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption on Friday.
Having been expelled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of receiving 19 million yuan in bribes, according to media officials in China.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also president of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped businesses and managers win contracts, loans and promotions in exchange for money or gifts, the Primary Intermediate Court in Beijing declared on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon is a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
The head of state has promised that justice would be just as inflexible with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the lesser officials - although just a handful of high-ranking officials has been sentenced, including former executives of oil giant PetroChina.
The most recent high-profile case has been that of the former head of the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in prison in September for corruption and power abuse. Previously his sights were set on the highest offices in the state.
Nevertheless, the government has not declared any intention of reforming its anti-corruption system, for example by creating a body independent of the Party.
