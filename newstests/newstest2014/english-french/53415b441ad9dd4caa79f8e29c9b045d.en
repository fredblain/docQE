News: Tokyo Stock Exchange Closes 0.88% Down
The Tokyo stock exchange was down at closing time on Friday, in spite of good manufacturing figures from China.
The list suffered as a result of the decline of the dollar against the yen, which is harmful to export values, and of the annual profit warning issued by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index dropped 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix was 11.23 points (0.94%) down, at 1,183.03.
Sony dropped more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
