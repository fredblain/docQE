US Green-lights Publicis-Omnicom Merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday that they had not received any objection from the American authorities to their plans to merge, thus bringing closer the creation of the world's biggest advertising agency.
The merger brings together the world's second largest agency, Omnicom, and the third largest, Publicis.
"The Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the period of investigation into the previously announced merger of the Publicis Group and Omnicom, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups announced in a press release.
They specified that they had also received the necessary authorisations from Canada, India and Turkey, in addition to those from South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the period of investigation provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy many of the conditions necessary for the move to take place.
"The merger is also conditional upon obtaining other regulatory authorisations and the approval of the two groups' shareholders," they add.
