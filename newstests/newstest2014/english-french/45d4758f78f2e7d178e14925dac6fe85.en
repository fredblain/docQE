Gesves: Faulty Water Heater Causes Explosion of House
The grandmother apparently lit a cigarette while there was a gas leak,
leading to an explosion in a house in Gesves that left two people seriously injured on Friday morning - the 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson. The explosion was caused by a gas leak in a faulty water heater, the assistant public prosecutor said on Friday evening.
The expert, who was dispatched to the scene by the public prosecutor's office, stated that the cause of the explosion was purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette when there was a gas leak and a build-up of gas.
The condition of the two victims remains critical.
The grandmother was thrown across the room by the explosion and seriously burnt.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and partner, was by her side and suffered less serious burns.
"The two victims were intubated and treated for some time at the site, before being taken to the CHU in Liège, by helicopter and by ambulance for the grandmother and her grandson respectively," said Mayor José Paulet on visiting the site.
The traumatised grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
He was unhurt and, thus, able to go downstairs using the staircase which had remained intact, though the rear wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the house next door, which was weakened by the explosion, have been accommodated elsewhere by the head of the social services.
The Andenne and Namur fire departments and the police from Arches intervened.
The Crisnée civil protection services has stabilised the two buildings.
