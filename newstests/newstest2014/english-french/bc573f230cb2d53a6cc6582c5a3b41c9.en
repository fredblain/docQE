Abortion Law in Texas Challenged
A federal appeal court in Texas has reintroduced certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy, which had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
The decision means that a legal text adopted in the state in July generally challenging the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
The decision by the court of appeal means that doctors who practise abortion will need to have an "admitting privilege" with local hospitals.
An admitting privilege is the right of a doctor to admit a patient to a hospital or a medical centre to carry out a diagnosis or a procedure, based on his status as a health care worker at a hospital.
Defenders of abortion stress that the content of the law may lead to the immediate closure of a third of clinics in the state, as these clinics have failed to obtain the admitting privilege for their practitioners.
In all, nearly 22,000 women will be deprived of access to such establishments.
On Monday, the day before the law was due to come into force, a trial judge considered that the provisions pertaining to admitting privileges were unconstitutional.
But the Attorney General for Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is canvassing for the role of governor, asked the court of appeal to overturn the judgement from the trial court blocking the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on the matter is scheduled to take place in January.
