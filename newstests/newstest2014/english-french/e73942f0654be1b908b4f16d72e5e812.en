Congolese Army Hunts Down M23 Rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would be hunting down M23 rebels right up to their bases located in the forests and mountains of North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be on the verge of defeat, having been driven out of the towns in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo (RDC), which it had been in control of since the start of the uprising 20 months ago.
"We will pursue the M23 and drive it out of wherever it is hiding because they are criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman for the FARDC, declared to Reuters.
"We must not allow them to regroup because they have been making the Congolese people suffer for too long.
The time has come for peace to be restored."
Leaders of the M23 say they evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bisimwa, political leader of the rebellion, asserted on RFI that these military setbacks would not change its demands at the peace talks in any way.
According to the Ugandan mediators,talks between the government in Kinshasa and the M23 resumed in Kampala on Wednesday,.
Skirmishes were reported in the hills above Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the rebels to fall this week, and around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion started in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu, taking advantage of the retreat of the government garrison and the inaction of the Monusco blue berets.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the largest in the world in terms of numbers, to reinforce its mandate and form a rapid intervention force consisting of soldiers from South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania.
Meanwhile, FARDC staff has been reshuffled and the army has gone on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The rate of progress of the government troops today is unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be nearing its end," predicted an expert in Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the government in Kinshasa has succeeded in quashing a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that there is no armed group allied to Rwanda present in the east of the RDC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda of providing military support to the M23, which has initially made up of mutinous former Congolese soldiers. Rwanda vehemently denies this.
The British Foreign Secretary, William Hague, called on the Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman announced.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military retaliation after shells landed in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana took to the streets of the town to welcome the entry of the FARDC troops.
"We have been living with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable that we would one day be freed by the army," said an inhabitant of the town on the border with Uganda.
"We have been living in terror [of the M23], we are traumatised," the man added.
