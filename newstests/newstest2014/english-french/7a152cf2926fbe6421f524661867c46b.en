For more than a year, I have been noticing the strong dissatisfaction of people I meet everywhere: the horrendous revaluation of their properties, a deluge of taxes, the costs of all sorts of permits, endless administrative fees, etc.
In short, the limitless siphoning of money from our pockets.
Millions of squandered dollars could be saved by introducing a tax system that is much more respectful of the taxpayers.
Money forcibly raised from taxpayers reduces their disposable income and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of every major business, there is no embarrassment about the extravagant expenditure and the maintenance of white elephants, such as the unprofitable cultural centre, the huge subsidies for the Cité de l'Énergie, etc.
These facilities are not profitable, so they should be sold to private businesses or demolished.
It is also distressing to note the compulsory purchase of numerous properties to make way for a major industrial complex which never arrived.
However, I do make honourable mention of the transformation of the former Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to the taxpayers?
It is not up to the public purse to invest in such projects, but to the private sector based on consumer demand.
The townsfolk have been pleased to learn that Lac à la Pêche and Lac des Piles will continue to supply the town with potable water.
Following the departure of all the industries (major consumers of water) and the big decline in the population, the use of water throughout the district has considerably reduced.
While this does not call for wastage, the town will never be short of water, and the severe regulation of its use may be toned down significantly.
In a nutshell, it is easy to do great things with other people's money.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this town is no longer even capable of buying a pen without passing a loan bye-law.
For over 40 years we have been run largely by suits with marvellous qualifications. I do not believe that a sheep farmer would do any worse.
