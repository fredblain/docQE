Hyeres Hosts Sixth Edition of Play Skateboard on Saturday
The sixth edition of Play Skateboard will be held at the skate park in Hyeres this Saturday, 02 November.
Organised by section SK8 Unity of the Bump association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations will be conducted on-site on Saturday morning from 9am, and the qualification stages will follow shortly after at 10am. The final is scheduled for 3pm and the prize-award ceremony for 4pm.
The public will be able to enjoy the technical prowess of young skaters, some of whom, like Hyeres' young star, Lorenzo Palumbo, have already taken part in top-notch competitions.
Just 10 years old, he has already won his place in this year's European Championships in Copenhagen, and he enjoys nothing more than beating competitors almost twice his size!
