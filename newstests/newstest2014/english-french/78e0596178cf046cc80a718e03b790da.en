DRC: Army Prepares New Assault

On Friday the Congolese army was preparing a new assault on the final bastions of the M23 rebels close to Bunagana in the east of the DRC.
The aim of the assault is to flush the M23 out of the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took Bugina hill, which overlooks Mbuzi hill.
Today, Mbuzi is expected to fall as well.
Then only Rumyoni hill will be left.
"Chanzu hill is not strategic," the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told the AFP.
Mr Paluku hopes to be in Bunagana on Saturday.
The town, which is a political stronghold and the final bastion of the rebellion, lies on the border with Uganda, around 80km north of Goma.
It was recaptured by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) on Wednesday.
Since then, several hundred M23 diehards have been cut off in the farmland hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the neighbouring town of Jomba, at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres.
In Jomba, a local contact who had reported fighting at close quarters throughout Thursday said that the situation had been "calm since this morning".
He also said that a woman and child had been killed in fighting the previous evening and had been buried.
A little girl sustained injuries from gunfire, and three other people had been wounded. One of them was seriously hit and had been evacuated by the FARDC, the witness quoted by the AFP added.
Since the resumption of hostilities between the FARDC and the rebels on 25 October, the two sides have given no indication of the casualties.
