Greece: Two Dead in Shooting Near Neo-Nazi Party Office
Two people were killed and another seriously injured on Friday evening by gunshots fired by two people on a motorbike that was passing an office used by neo-Nazi party, Golden Dawn, in the western suburbs of Athens, a police source has said.
The police are currently unable to give any information on the identity of the victims or any political affiliations they had.
According to reports from some Greek media, members of Golden Dawn said the victims were guarding the party's premises.
The injured person was immediately taken to hospital, the same source said.
Anti-terrorist service police rushed to the main avenue in the suburb of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place, and sealed off the area.
The incident comes a few weeks after six Golden Dawn members, including the leader and founder of the party, were charged with being part of a "criminal organisation", within the framework of an operation aimed at the party following the murder of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
