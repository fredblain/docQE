October: Bloodiest Month in Iraq Since 2008
October was the bloodiest month in Iraq since April 2008
Baghdad published official figures on Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month - 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers.
The publication came on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister met the American President.
Noury al-Maliki is seeking aid from the United States.
"We are not asking the world to stand by our side and support us, but we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," declared Al-Maliki in Washington this Thursday.
"And because if what is happening in Iraq is not handled, it will spread, as will what is happening in Syria.
And what happens when the virus of terrorism is alive? It spreads."
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute of Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, demonstrators were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They were brandishing placards accusing him and others of being murderers and appealing to the United States to refuse to give him aid.
