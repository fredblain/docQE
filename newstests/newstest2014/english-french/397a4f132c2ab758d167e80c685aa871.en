Egyptian Islamists Take to Streets to Denounce Morsi Trial
Anger is brewing in the ranks of Egypt's Islamists.
Two days before the start of the trial of deposed President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
There have been demonstrations throughout Egypt to demand the reinstatement of the country's first democratically-elected president.
"It's not a trial," says one Muslim Brotherhood activist.
"He has still not been able to see a lawyer and no volunteer has been able to get a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce."
"The trial of President Morsi is a fake trial," says an angry Morsi supporter. "He should be having Sisi tried, not the other way round.
Morsi should try Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda and the massacre by the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor."
Confrontations broke out in Alexandria, where the police used tear gas and 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 policemen were deployed in front of the Police Academy in Cairo, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
