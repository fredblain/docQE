Man Wearing Nazi Uniform Chased Away from Supermarket
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform with a swastika armband was asked to leave a British supermarket following complaints by customers to the manager of the shop, who called the police, according to the shop on Friday.
"We received a number of complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the shop," explained a spokesperson for the Asda chain of supermarkets.
The shop called the police for assistance, but "by the time they arrived he had already left without making a scene," she added.
"I was queuing when I saw a woman who seemed very upset.
People were flabbergasted.
You don't go out in public dressed like that unless you want to attract attention," said one customer, Rosina Rusin, 60, to the Cambridge News.
The incident occurred on Thursday - Halloween - when it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it is hard to believe that this was a hoax.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I have been wearing a black SS armband in Asda twice a week for three years," claimed Paul Dutton, explaining that he was suffering from "mental problems".
