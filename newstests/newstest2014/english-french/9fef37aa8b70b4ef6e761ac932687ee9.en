22-year-old Top Model Starts Acting Career in Grand Style.
The director Lars von Trier chose her to play the young Charlotte Gainsbourg in his next film, Nymphomaniac.
This pornographic drama in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (on January 1st and 8th) deals with the erotic memories of a forty-year-old hooked on sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her elder sister is striking: a twig-like figure, a transparent complexion and Franco-English origins.
And she likes taking risks - the girl who did not hesitate to pose naked on glossy paper will be exposing herself in much more nefarious situations on the big screen.
An excerpt from Nymphomaniac caused a lot of excitement on the Internet: it shows Stacy Martin in the middle of a climax in bed with Shia LaBeouf.
The provocative filmmaker may have asked his actors to put their shame to one side, but he had to use X-rated film professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging the bodies digitally: the top half is the star, the bottom half is the double.
From Bj√∂rk to Charlotte Gainsbourg through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing his actresses to the limit, always in a bid to achieve the best.
Stacy Martin is not done being the topic of conversations.
