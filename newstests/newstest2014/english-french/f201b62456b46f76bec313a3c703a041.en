Beijing Accuses Uighur Group of Tiananmen Attack
The head of internal security in China accused a group of Uighur separatists from Xinjiang on Friday of being behind the car bomb attack in Tiananmen Square in the centre of Beijing on Monday, which left five people dead.
The vehicle, an SUV, raced towards the crowd in the famous square in the Chinese capital, the symbol of the bloody 1989 suppression, before catching fire, killing its three occupants and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the politburo in charge of internal security issues, accused the East Turkestan Islamic Movement of instigating the attack.
Numerous Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
The Chinese government believes the movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence in the province, sparked by demands for independence.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," said Meng on Hong Kong television channel Phoenix TV.
"The group hiding behind the scenes was the East Turkestan Islamic Movement," he added, his words being relayed by the Xinhua News Agency.
The Chinese police have identified the driver of the vehicle, whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin, and stated that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The vehicle also held containers full of petrol and a flag with orthodox religious writing on it.
The incident left 42 people injured.
The East Turkestan Islamic Movement is considered by the United States and the United Nations to be a terrorist organization.
