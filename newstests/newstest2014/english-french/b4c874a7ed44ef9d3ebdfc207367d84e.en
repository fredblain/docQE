Row Over Closure of Emergency Unit at Hôtel-Dieu
In light of the rebellion that has been running for several months involving a section of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on July 10 to "put back the schedule for implementing the project and, in particular, the date for closing the emergency unit which cannot take place on November 4".
This was an official request made so as "not to run any risks when dealing with emergency services in Paris at the start of winter", but also aimed at avoiding to hinder the Socialist Party's campaign a few months before local elections.
Despite the minister's instructions, the closure is nevertheless expected to take effect on this date.
At the APHP, officials prefer the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" to closure.
From November 4, the units of the fire brigade, which accounted for a quarter of the 40,000 cases brought to the emergency unit of the Hôtel-Dieu each year, will all have received instructions to take their about thirty serious cases per day to the emergency units of other hospitals in Paris.
November 4 is also the day on which hospital training resumes.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, interns specialising in emergencies will make way for five general medicine interns on Monday.
The transfer of internal medicine beds is scheduled for some point during the month.
"The Hôtel-Dieu emergency service has to close as soon as possible, and for us, that's November 4," Loïc Capron, the chairperson of the medical committee (CME) at the APHP which supports the management project, says straightforwardly.
"On November 4, patients will no longer be brought by the fire brigade, there will only be people arriving by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, chief medical officer at the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"However, we will continue accepting emergency cases," he tempers, emphasising the permanent presence of emergency medical service vehicles on site to move critical cases.
"Senior emergency doctors will remain on site," he also assures.
But the decision to close the emergency service resides with the regional health agency (ARS).
"Things are moving gradually," says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, for whom "there will be no change in terms of the service offered", come November 4.
"The minister has either lied to us or has been lied to," laments emergency medical officer, Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his position as head of emergency services in early July for taking a stand against the reorganisation project, he defines himself as a "whistle-blower" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by the "technical medical administration body".
"They are in the process of abandoning and killing off emergency units that were reformed less than five years ago," he believes.
For him, "if the other emergency services in Paris were able to absorb the surplus, there wouldn't be a problem."
But they are regularly saturated.
For example, there is sometimes a nine hour wait at the emergency unit at Lariboisière.
The ARS stresses that thirty patients "despatched" to several locations does not run the risk of becoming an "avalanche" for the other emergency services, where human resources would have been reinforced anyway.
The ARS, like the APHP, is defending the "new hospital model" which started being implemented on October 7 and is expected to continue taking 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year.
By the end of the year, self-employed GPs are also expected to participate in the implementation of an "ambulatory care service".
"Where are we heading if we start asking people to self-diagnose?" asks Gérald Kierzek, for whom "the concept of a non-major emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical step backwards".
"The same thing will happen as with level 3 maternity units.
People are not stupid, they will go wherever the best care is offered."
"If the minister does not take a step by Monday, we will take a different approach," warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency medical officer and member of the healthcare CGT.
"We will have a greater presence in the local election campaigns and we will think about putting up a list."
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, a UMP councillor in Paris and MP of the 4th arrondissement, states clearly that "even if the UMP in Paris supports the continuation of emergency services at Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if you look at the duties."
Ann Hidalgo, the Socialist Party's candidate, repeated on Monday morning on France Inter that she was in favour of a moratorium to prevent the closure on November 4.
If it went ahead, she would register her clear disagreement, stresses Bruno Juillard, her spokesman.
"Even though the reorganisation of the Hôtel-Dieu has an underlying justification, we cannot let this happen without an acceptable plan for the transfer of patients to other hospitals."
