Toronto Mayor Chases Off Journalists Seeking to Interview Him on Drug Affair
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of using drugs, according to several media sources.
A video sent to the authorities seems to support these suspicions.
The man concerned, Rob Ford, has always denied having taken crack, but has admitted being partial to cannabis.
This Thursday he drove a number of journalists off his property when they came to interview him.
We also think that sometimes pictures need no explanation or comment.
