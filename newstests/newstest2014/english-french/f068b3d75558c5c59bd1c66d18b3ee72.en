German Journalists Urged to Shun Google and Yahoo
The union of German journalists urged its members to stop using Google and Yahoo online services on Thursday, following new revelations concerning the activities of the American and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists is recommending that journalists avoid using the Google and Yahoo search engine and messaging services until further notice," it said in a press release.
It calls the reports in the Washington Post "scandalous". According to these, the National Security Agency (NSA) in America and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Britain have gathered loads of information by infiltrating international networks, enabling the two bodies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is just as confidential as the details of their sources and the nature of their communication with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union, which has 38,000 members.
