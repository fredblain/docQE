Chevron, the second largest oil company in America, announced a drop in quarterly profits on Friday, as a result of a reduction in its refining margins, although its production of oil and gas increased while still being below the group's target.
Its net profit for the third quarter went down to $4,950 million, or $2.57 per share, as opposed to $5,250 million, or $2.69 per share, the previous year.
Analysts questioned by Reuters were counting on an average profit of $2.71 per share.
The group produced 2.59 million oil-equivalent barrels per day during the course of the quarter, an increase compared to the 2.52 million barrels per day produced a year before.
The company is targeting 2.65 million barrels per day for this year, with an increase of 25% in production planned by 2017.
The majority of the growth in the years to come will come from its liquefied natural gas schemes in Australia.
Because of the cost of these schemes, annual investment costs have gone up by seven thousand million dollars in two years and are expected to reach 36,700 million dollars in 2013.
The profits from production activities went down slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell 45% to 380 million dollars.
The reduction in refining margins is affecting the entire sector.
Chevron's main competitor, Exxon, also announced a drop in net profits on Thursday, despite an increase in its gas and oil production.
