Air Raid Against Military Installations in Syria
Israeli aircrafts entered Lebanese air space early on Wednesday afternoon, but did not carry out attacks until the evening, according to the Lebanese army.
A cargo of short range SA-8 ground-to-air missiles was targeted and destroyed.
This latest raid by the Israeli air force in Syrian territory (the sixth since the start of the year, according to the Israeli daily newspaper, Haaretz) has been confirmed neither by Israel nor Syria.
The raid took place under circumstances almost identical to that of July 5: on that occasion, it was also an unnamed American official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack that targeted Yakhont ground-to-air missiles supplied to Damascus by Russia.
Israeli officials made no attempt to hide their anger when Washington revealed the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to respond.
