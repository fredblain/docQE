Moving Tribute to War Veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civilian, religious and military officials, plus numerous patriotic organisations, paid tribute to all soldiers and victims of every war on Friday afternoon.
Flowers were laid on two of the three military burial plots in the cemetery by Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various other personalities.
