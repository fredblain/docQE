Google Glass Accessories Shop Launched
An online shop offering a range of accessories for Google Glass has just been launched for the thousands of developers who own a prototype of the Google-branded, web-enabled glasses.
It means they can now get headphones, a charger or even a storage case.
The shop, which is strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories, such as a charger and USB cable, for $50.
It is also possible to get a micro-fiber protective cover or in-ear headphones for the same price.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass equipped with corrective lenses, no date for a full-scale launch has yet been announced.
