Former Hostage in Lebanon Says "Coming Back is Difficult to Handle"
Journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was kidnapped on 08 March 1986, along with three members of his Antenne 2 team who had come to film a Hezbollah demonstration, and was set free almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
He retired in 2008, but in 2004 he helped set up a hostage defence association, "Otages du Monde" ("Hostages of the World"), which he has been running for several years.
The main objective of the association is to make it possible for hostages to press charges and bring their kidnappers before the International Criminal Court.
Four AQMI (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) hostages, Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Feret, were freed on Tuesday after being held for over 1,000 days.
Following medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Grâce on Wednesday afternoon, they have now been reunited with their families.
Now they can gradually try to resume their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" interviewed 62-year-old Jean-Louis Normandin, a former senior reporter who retired in 2008 and is president of the association "Otages du Monde".
On the evening you were set free, you appeared on the mid-evening news on Antenne 2.
What are your memories of being set free today?
On the ground specifically, in Beirut?
The day I was set free, I was in the boot of a car where I met Roger Auque - although I couldn't see him as it was dark.
He said "We're free," but I wasn't sure and thought we might still be killed.
We were very excited, but also very tense.
It was in the middle of a war and the people driving us too were very tense.
They dropped us off on a pavement.
There were Syrian soldiers there.
We were then taken to the Hotel Summerland where the press had gathered.
Some Frenchmen took us to the French Embassy.
That was when I made my first call to my parents, my family, my friends, the press and so on.
I remember taking a one-hour bath,
and having dinner in a T-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night spent talking to Roger and Marchiani.
It was still tense as there was no way of evacuating us to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
We got there by helicopter and took a private plane to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua got on board.
How were you received when you got to French soil?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, the Prime Minister, was there.
It was a bit rough,
the jostling was unbelievable.
And there was a lot of media.
When I left the country, there were three television channels -
when I got back there were loads of them.
Coming down the steps of the aeroplane, being reunited with my son and parents, my friends, that was all very emotional.
Numerous motorbikes followed our car, which was driven by Roussin, from the airport to my home.
The bikes were jostling to get in front and take photos. They followed me all the way home, where I had to do some policing to stop some of them climbing up.
The media pressure was huge.
It wouldn't stop and we were well placed to know that...
Yet, the level of emotion and fatigue made it difficult to think clearly.
You come out of a hole and are suddenly in the spotlight of the media.
It's a bit complicated, a bit of a shock, quite difficult to handle.
But we'd been through the hardest part.
I was on the mid-evening news that same evening, and on TV the following day as well.
Then a very gentle sort of readjustment to life started, lasting one or two months that were a bit like a holiday.
How did the medical examinations and the debriefing with the DGSE (Directorate General for External Security) go?
I had to undergo an initial medical check in Corsica.
The other tests were carried out in Val-de-Grâce in the days after my return: X-rays, examinations of every type, and an appointment with a psychiatrist.
Everything can't be sorted out in one appointment, but you know you can count on the psychiatrist, call on him if needed, that you have not been abandoned to yourself.
It is all part of the process.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me a lot of questions about the hostage-takers.
It was normal.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the liberation of the four hostages in Niger?
I'm listening to what's being said.
Especially the debate about ransoms.
Some things annoy me, others less so.
I try to distinguish between the questions about my past as a hostage and my role as president of the association "Otages du Monde", which enables me to keep a distance and seems to me more interesting to deal with.
For example, I think about the definition of resilience.
And, I fight, alongside other people, for the recognition of the legal status of hostages.
I think there is a problem of semantics.
We need to qualify hostage-taking as "political" hostage-taking - that's what it is for the most part - and enable the hostages to have access to justice, to press charges and to bring their kidnappers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is wrapped up in compassion, emotion and is rejoicing that the hostages are free.
But who is saying that the hostages may also have access to justice?
The court in The Hague has been set up for that purpose.
Why should we not say to the hostage-takers: "You have flouted the rules of war and those of all the Geneva Conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
I think that is justified, legitimate, plain common sense.
People hear the message, but do not listen, and that shocks me.
That's my main struggle.
