The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal bad bank structure to cover £38 billion (€45,000 million) of its highest risk assets, a step designed to improve its relations with the City and accelerate its re-privatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of toxic assets on its books from 55% to 70% over the next two years and hopes to clean them up completely in three years.
RBS has also said that it will be writing down a provision of £4 500 million for the depreciation of additional bad debts for the quarter, an entry related to the setting up of the hive-off structure.
RBS has also specified that this internal restructuring would release £10-11 000 million in capital, thus strengthening its lending ability.
The bank and the City have stressed that the "bad bank" would enable a break-off from the past, government in particular having been accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forwards and focus on the future and on the 90% of assets that make up a really good bank, and on building a great bank for our clients and the United Kingdom," new director general, Ross McEwan, said to the press.
