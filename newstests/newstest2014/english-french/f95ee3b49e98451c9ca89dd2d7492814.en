Ceremony in Memory of the Cremated
The Père Lachaise crematorium is organizing a lay ceremony at 11am in memory of all those cremated at the establishment this year.
Anne Hidalgo, socialist candidate for Paris mayorship, is expected to attend and will later explain her proposals on funerary matters at a press conference.

More and more French people are choosing cremation for their own funerals rather than inhumation - 53% against 47%, according to an Ipsos survey carried out on September 6 and 7 among 1,009 people.
It is the opposite for the funeral of a loved one - the French prefer inhumation (53% against 47%).
Only 15% of those who lose a child choose cremation.
In his book, La Mort en Cendres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-chairperson of the Comité National d'Ethique du Funéraire emphasises the "violence" that cremation represents for those left behind.
With cremation, there is a sense of "violence committed against the body of a loved one", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time instead of after a process of decomposition that "would accompany the stages of grief".
There is also a "symbolic violence" that relates to the "obliteration of the person's singularity and of distinctive symbols", which are reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is this accepted without difficulty in certain Nordic and protestant countries, but is still taken badly in France?
"Because cremation is a recent development," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Thanatological Society and author of the book Apprivoiser la Mort.
The Catholic Church only started tolerating it in 1963, a fact that has restricted efforts at getting to grips with it.
For François Michaud-Nérard, director general of Funerary Services for the City of Paris, getting to grips with cremation is about giving the deceased a ceremony as dignified as it would have been with an inhumation.
The annual Ipsos survey shows the strength of attachment to the arrangement of the ceremony.
77% of French want one for their loved ones, be it religious (53%) or civil (24%).
Nowadays, 73% of people choosing cremation want a ceremony to be arranged.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want one.
Crematoria have adapted to this change in society.
"For a decade or so, they have been trying hard to spare families from the feeling of violence in waiting for an hour and a half, doing nothing, followed immediately by their being handed the ashes," observes Michaud-Nérard.
70% of establishments now offer a master of ceremonies to conduct the following ritual in the presence of the body: greet the congregation, mention the deceased by name, connect the deceased to those present, evoke who the person was, give sense to their death, organise a farewell.
This is what has been happening at the Père Lachaise crematorium since 1998.
The masters of ceremonies are often people who have moved into this new type of employment.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that, since 2010, the Père Lachaise crematorium has been organising a number of memorial ceremonies, lay and non-religious, on All Saints Day, to which it invites the families of all those who have been cremated during the course of the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies has been relayed online, for those could not attend.
The crematorium has authorised us to broadcast it.
