A 38-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy school in Surrey is facing six charges, according to the Royal Gendarmerie of Canada.
Omar Moustapha Hassan stands accused of hostage-taking, hostage-holding, making of verbal threats, carrying a weapon with dangerous intent, abduction and failure to follow an order.
"The fast response by the police officer involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were critical to the safe ending of this incident," said Lance Corporal Bert Paquet in a press release.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and is due to appear in court on Friday.
