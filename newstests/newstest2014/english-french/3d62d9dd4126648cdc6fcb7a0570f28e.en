Scott Brown Appeal Rejected
Scott Brown, Glasgow Celtic captain, has had his appeal rejected and will miss his club's next two Champion's League matches, against Ajax and AC Milan.
The Scotland midfielder was sent off for a foul against Neymar in the match against FC Barcelona. UEFA has now extended his suspension to three matches.
In a press release, the club said it was "very disappointed" and that the appeal was entirely justified.
