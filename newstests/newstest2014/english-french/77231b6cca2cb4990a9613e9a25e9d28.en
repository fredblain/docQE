Lou Reed Dies During Tai Chi Session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife, Laurie Anderson, announced in a letter published by the regional newspaper, East Hampton Star, which is meant for residents of Springs, the town where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning while looking at the trees and doing the famous 21st form of tai chi, with his musician hands striking the air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master of the Chinese martial art known as tai chi.
The singer's wife also said that, a week before his death, she had promised her husband she would get him out of hospital and take him back to their home in Springs (Long Island).
"Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
Even though we are city dwellers, this is our spiritual home.
Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know his songs on pain and beauty in the world will fill many people with the incredible joy of life which he felt," she added.
Lou Reed had undergone a liver transplant last May.
