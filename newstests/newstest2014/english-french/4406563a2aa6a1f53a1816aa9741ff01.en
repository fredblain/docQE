It's a comeback in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who is staging "A Danse Danse", her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the ink drawings and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos of Gymnopédies de Satie.
This is an evening that showcases Chouinard's entire spectrum, from art to mannerisms and from the blackness of ink to whiteness.
The background is a white screen.
On the carpet, which is also white, in the immense space of the Théâtre Maisonneuve, a body appears, in profile, as thin as a line and dressed in black.
An Henri Michaux ink drawing is projected onto the screen.
The body, a simple stroke, takes its shape.
And this shape is definitive of the entire piece: it is a series of physical representations of drawings.
The dancers, all dressed in black, with only their hands and faces uncovered, wait on each side of the stage; they hurry on when the next graphic appears, incarnate it, then run off again.
This Henri Michaux play with black and white is performed as a series of solos, in a group in unison (a mass acting as a solo), a large group of twelve solos, in which each individual makes a representation of their own sign.
It is reminiscent of "Gloire du matin", wherein, in the form of solos, Chouinard delivers a series of choreographic tasks drawn on cartels and lined up at the front of the stage.
It is the same principle in a giant PowerPoint version.
In this performance, the music is loud,accompanied by percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is great, and the rhythm fast.
There is a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, microphone in hand, to deliver, with no sobriety or reserve, part of a Michaux poem, in the flat monotonous voice of an auction, then continues to dance.
The music starts again, and the sequence continues.
This sustained (if that is possible) discharge of sound and energy ends up being deafening and numbing,
as does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are several beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been one of Chouinard's strong points - like the hair that is ruffled or the black fabric that extends the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
One gets the impression that, instead of going in search of Michaux's work, the choreographer has imposed herself on it with using her mannerisms.
The result is bodies that seem flat in front of the drawings.
The Michaux inks, like Gestalt shapes, provide a level of imagination broader and richer than dance, more porous.
Only at the end, which is in negative, with the dancers broken up a strobe lights and becoming white symbols in a suddenly dark theatre, does it touch on magic.
The audience liked it, the reception was warm.
After the interval, the Gymnopédies is richer.
The stage is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabric, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers take turns to play the scores.
Their touching musical awkwardness shows real fragility.
Couples cross the stage as pairs of lovers, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transiting solos, moving as a group, a chorus, makes the depiction less binary.
Clowns appear, another regular feature of Chouinard's work, wearing red noses, in very polarised parades of male/female lovers.
Their loves are toothy, evasive or playful.
The body movements, the laughter, the small cries beautifully translate the archaicness, the gracefulness and the absurdity of bodies in coitus, of beings melting into each other.
But the piece really takes off after the bow.
A clown comes back on stage as the audience is leaving.
At that point, anything goes: the fourth wall comes down, the explored universes are superimposed, the dancers ham it up, come down among the spectators, talk, smoke, pass through, play with the etiquette of applause, build up the hype amid a consciously calculated disorder that remains sensual.
They exude joy and madness, and that is Chouinard's art; contaminating the audience.
