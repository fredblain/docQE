Paris Saint-Germain will face Lorient on Friday without its trump card, the Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is suffering from an injury, the Ligue 1 club announced in a press release.
PSG, who are top of the league ahead of Monaco on goal difference, issued the team sheet for the match, which is the 12th of the season, on which the 32-year-old striker did not appear.
The press release said only that he is "injured", without saying what the injury was.
However, he was suffering from an inflammation on the left knee following his return from international duty this month.
