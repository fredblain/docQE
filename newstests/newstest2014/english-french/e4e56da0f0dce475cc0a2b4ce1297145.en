Charles-de-Gaulle Aircraft Carrier "Unavailable"
The aircraft carrier has been left high and dry in Toulon.
A leak of radioactive steam, detected on one of the two nuclear stokeholds on the Charles-de-Gaulle in mid-October when the ship was at sea, "posed no threat to the sailors", but is no small matter for the Navy.
"La Royale" - the French Navy - has just conformed that the ship will be "unavailable until mid-November" to allow "time to carry out the corrective measures required" on the reactor.
Specialist naval defence company DCNS has confirmed that its teams, along with Areva's, have been dispatched to the department of Var and are "currently working on aircraft carrier".
Their tasks include changing a pump on the faulty stokehold.
"Everything has been put in place to enable the Charles-de-Gaulle to be deployed as planned at the end of 2013," explains DCNS.
And the Navy assures that "this has in no way delayed the [nuclear-powered] ship's activity schedule".
It should be recalled that the Charles-de-Gaulle had just returned from a six-month period of interim maintenance.
It had cast off from Toulon in mid-October for a training exercise,
principally for the qualification of new fighter pilots.
A "small amount of damage", confined to the area of the reactor chamber, then occurred on the French fleet's flagship.
According to the Navy, the crew was not exposed to any radioactive contamination.
