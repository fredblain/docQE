School Transport: Complaint Judged Admissible
Since the beginning of the academic year, the Sherbrooke Region School Board (CSRS) has been demanding a $150 fee per student (to a maximum of $300 per family) for students using school transport to get to two addresses, a service that the organisation offers when it is able to.
No financial contribution had been demanded prior to the changes made to the last budget.
"The Board proposed a mediation service and I was interested," says Mrs Lefevre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to a mediation and she asked for an additional period for consideration.
"It is always better to discuss, consult and find solutions such issues," Mrs Lefevre believes.
The Sherbrooke Region School Board (CSRS) did not wish to comment on the issue.
The organisation merely indicated that the mediation was part of a process arising from a complaint.
