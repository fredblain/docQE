Former Gestapo Chief Buried in Jewish Cemetery
Heinrich Muller, who was never found after disappearing at the end of the Second World War, was actually buried in a common grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, confirmed to Bild.
Muller did not survive the war.
"His body was buried in a common grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin Mitte in 1945," he confirmed in the popular daily newspaper, basing his statement on archives.
This revelation comes 68 years after the fall of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime and solves one of the big post-War mysteries.
The German Secret Service, the BND, declared in summer 1949 that Muller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
But the secret services were completely wrong.
"Muller's body was found in August 1945 by a commando in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Reich," says Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general's uniform".
"His service papers and photo, amongst other things, were found in the inside left pocket," he continued.
Bild also published a document from the borough hall of the Mitte district in Berlin, indicating that he had been buried in the district's Jewish cemetery.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation.
Finding that one of the most brutal Nazi sadists was buried in a Jewish cemetery is an abhorrent enormity, he said.
"The memory of the victims is being trampled underfoot in the worst manner," he said disgustedly in the paper.
Heinrich Muller was one of the major figures in the Third Reich never to be captured.
He took part in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, where the "final solution" was decided upon, and notably was in command of Adolf Eichmann, who was responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews and who was sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.
