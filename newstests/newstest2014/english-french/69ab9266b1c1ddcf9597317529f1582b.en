David Bowie: Four Unpublished Songs Released
The British musician is full of surprises this year.
Following The Next Day, released in January, he has put together a deluxe re-release planned for November 04, featuring several unpublished tracks.
Four have already appeared on the Internet.
The announcement that David Bowie was releasing a new album had stunned the world.
On 08 January 2013, the date of his 66th birthday, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (his last record, Reality, was released in 2003) and very few public appearances, the British musician proved that he could still light up the pop scene.
A feast for fans
Not tired of making surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick up his sleeves with The Next Day:
the Thin White Duke was also planning to re-release the album on November 04.
He put together a real feast for his fans to mark the occasion.
This re-release, titled The Next Day Extra, was presented in the form of three disks: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, plus a DVD containing the four clips that have already been unveiled.
The Next Day Extra had a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three songs from the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, and two remixes.
Moreover, David Bowie has introduced this fine box-set through a video.
In it, he presents each of the disks plus the accessories provided with them: exclusive photos and sleeves, a notebook for sharing your own impressions, a booklet of lyrics etc.
And finally, he gives a teaser to his new track, Atomica, which is typically in the style of The Next Day, with very prominent guitars and skillfully controlled rock electrics.
Previously Unpublished Tracks Released
However, Atomica is not the only track to have been released.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man and Born In A UFO are also available on the net.
The Informer is double-edged - an unsettling intro followed by a brilliant rush of sound that progressively slows down to make way for a pop ballad.
Was Bowie trying to make a reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity, in his Like A Rocket Man?
Either way, with this cheerful track, the singer seems to be in his element when his feet are no longer on the ground.
Space Oddity, by comparison, was much more solemn.
On Born in a UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: could he have come from another planet?
The spellbinding guitar riffs make you want to leave Earth.
In any case, Bowie enjoys playing the chameleon in these tracks: in turn, an informer, a rocket man, possibly a Martian...
He veils and reveals at the same time, and likes to take on different personalities, as he has throughout his career, most notably with his personas: Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It is therefore not surprising that he should be holding a mask in the promotional photography for L'Invitation au Voyage, by Louis Vuitton, of which he is the new face.
He appears in one of their adverts, broadcast from November 10.
