DRC: Army Attacks Last Rebel Stronghold
The diehards of the M23, who are several hundreds in number, had entrenched themselves at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres in the farmland hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located around 80km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"The fighting has not stopped since morning and is continuing despite the darkness," a resident of Jomba, according to whom a little girl had been injured by gunfire in the morning, told the AFP by telephone at around 12.30pm.
"The fighting has slightly reduced in intensity. It appears that the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) have pushed the rebels back a bit," he added.
According to this witness, who chose to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba, before going into action for a "combing operation".
The rattle of gunfire from light arms could clearly be heard in the background.
From Bunagana, a political stronghold and last preserve of the rebellion to fall on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear the detonation of heavy arms.
According to a source at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO), the fighting has entered "the final phase": the FARDC has "surrounded the remaining M23 positions to flush them out".
Since the resumption on Friday of confrontations between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, MONUSCO has not been participating directly in the fighting, but it is providing government's troops with critical support in terms of intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen well-equipped soldiers headed off towards the front.
They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, the frontier post with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians loaded up a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new truck belonging to the FARDC, intended to take over from another device pounding the positions of the M23 in the hills.
The Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, called on the rebels once again on Wednesday to "stand down voluntarily" or be disarmed "by force", while leaving open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been in discussions since December with no outcome as yet.
The political leaders of the M23 are hoping to reach an agreement there.
"We have finished the talks. The Ugandan mediators just need to organize the signing," asserted Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, although this information could not be confirmed immediately with the government.
The M23 was born of an April 2012 mutiny by former rebels, principally Tutsis who were integrated into the army in 2009 following a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23. Kigali and Kampala have denied the accusations.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated areas of the DRC, and its land abounds in coveted mineral resources.
At Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, to which around 5,000 people fled between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the process of returning which started in the morning was reversed at midday.
"This morning we went back across the border to go back to our fields, but the soldiers told us to go back," the AFP was told by Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back.
The gunfire seems to be getting closer to the population.
Early that evening, dozens of residents were crossing the border, some with mattresses on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
