Letta Confident of Government's Survival
The President of the Italian Council, Enrico Letta, believes his government will last until 2015, despite strong tension between the left and right wings within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate's vote on stripping Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate.
In an interview with daily newspaper La Stampa, the leader of the centre left said he had "every intention" of continuing to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The Upper House of the Italian parliament will meet this month to decide on the fate of the former president, who was found guilty of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi is threatening to withdraw his support to the government if the Senate, in which he has more opponents than supporters, decides to relieve him of his duties.
But one section of his camp, centered around the national secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) party, Angelino Alfano, is continuing to support the government, as it demonstrated on October 2 when it refused to follow Berlusconi's orders on a previous attempt to bring down the cabinet.
