In the U.S. it will be possible to use mobile devices during airplane takeoff and landing.
New rules for safe use of mobile devices during takeoff and landing of an airliner have been approved in the United States, reports the telecorporation BBC.
As expected, American airline companies will permit passengers to use smartphones and tablets during the entire flight, the new rules will take effect by the end of 2013.
Nonetheless, Internet connection to receive and send email will be prohibited during flights at a height lower than 3 kilometers.
Due to the danger of the emergence of interference of radio equipment of planes, cellular voice communications will be banned as before.
Thus, aircraft passengers will be allowed to read electronic books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to test the safety of using electronic devices during a flight.
In addition, airline companies will have to convince the U.S. federal aviation administration that they will be able to handle the presumptive impact of mobile devices on aviation equipment and airplane control devices.
According to a source, based on the U.S. example, in Great Britain it will also be possible to revise current norms for using electronic devices during flights.
