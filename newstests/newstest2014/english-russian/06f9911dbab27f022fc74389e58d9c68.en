Americans eavesdropped on high-ranking Japanese officials
On Friday, November 1, one of the representatives of American intelligence agencies who preferred to not disclose his name, claimed that the United States eavesdropped on the telephone conversations of high-ranking officials of Japan.
This person confirmed that in the land of the rising sun there are several sites intended for eavesdropping.
Moreover, he noted that the U.S.A., Great Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand do not conduct reconnaissance operations against each other.
According to him, such was formed during the Second World War when these countries were allies.
However, Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are targets for reconnaissance operations, reported the television channel NHK.
Officially, none of the parties has yet commented on this information.
Let us recall that news of surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies against the chancellor of Germany emerged last week.
According to data from German journalists, the NSA could have wiretapped the telephone of Merkel over a period of the last ten years.
The chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her wiretaps rather painfully.
She declared that such surveillance of a head of government by allies, who, according to her, Germany and the United States have been for decades, is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden declared that he is ready to share details about the wiretapping of telephone conversations of Angela Merkel with employees of the German prosecutor's office.
A German specially flew to Moscow in order to meet with the former CIA employee.
