Legislative bans have forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their estimates, consumption of beer in the country in the coming year will remain at the previous level, and that is the best case scenario.
Although businessmen initially expected growth.
After all, the current year is developing unsuccessfully for them: sales dropped by 7 percent.
All of this was told by the head of one of the largest beer brewing companies in the country, chairman of the Council of the Russian Beer Brewing Union Isaac Sheps at the Adam Smith Institute's 3rd annual conference "Day-to-day Goods in Russia", which just completed in Moscow.
At it they discussed government regulation of the market.
From 2008 through 2012 the Russian beer market already contracted by 18 percent since in recent years in the country we are observing significant strengthening of regulation of the beer brewing industry in terms of production and turnover of beer - a beverage with small alcohol content, Sheps told listeners.
There's no other country in the world with such rigid restriction of the beer market, unpredictable introduction of more and more new irrational bans that are supposedly founded on a battle against alcohol abuse.
The beer brewer complained that many legislative bans designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not exert any real influence, nonetheless more and more new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The ban on selling alcohol in kiosks that was introduced this year hit beer producers the hardest of all.
"We immediately lost 35 thousand consumers," said Isaac Sheps.
Beer brewers have two forecasts for the coming year.
Optimistic - the one Sheps talked about: sales of the frothy beverage will remain at the previous level.
Pessimistic - they will drop by another 2-3 percent.
In order to preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to move from varieties that are tailored to the mass consumer to the "premium" class: there will be less beer, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, radical consequences from the drop in sales with a small amount of alcohol are so far not apparent.
"Based on my observations, the level of alcoholism disorders remains at approximately the same level," said doctor-narcologist Aleksei Sotnikov.
Granted, there is an increased percentage of patients who consumed surrogates of hard liquors, as well as those who "got hooked" on alcohol-containing tonics such as "Jaguar", while ten years ago specifically "beer-based" alcoholism was dominant.
