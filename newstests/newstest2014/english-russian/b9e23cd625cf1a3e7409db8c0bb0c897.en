The acting board of directors of open joint-stock company Uralkali proposed the candidacy of the arrested in Minsk general director Vladislav Baumgertner for the new board membership, as reported on the website of the Russian company.
Baumgertner was entered into a list of 11 persons nominated for the new board of directors.
This list was prepared for the extraordinary meeting of shareholders on November 29 at which the new structure of the board of directors will be determined by vote.
Presently, Baumgertner is under house arrest in Minsk.
