"Yugra" general manager Andrei Belmach noted that so far it is difficult to say how much time will be needed to search for a new head trainer.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation occurred a few hours ago, therefore I am not ready to say how much time will be needed to search for a new trainer, ITAR-TASS cites Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are studying all possible options.
Preference will be given to a Russian specialist.
It is desired to not merely find some trainer, but the kind of person who will work in our club for several years and achieve certain results inside it.
