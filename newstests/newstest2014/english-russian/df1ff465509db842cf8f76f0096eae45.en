A series of premiere "Art-mainstream" film screenings will take place in Moscow
A series of "Art-mainstream" film screenings, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films several days before they are released, will take place in the "Rolan" movie theater from the 1st through the 5th of November, reports RIA "Novosti" citing the project organizers.
The French comedy from director and actress Reem Kherici "Paris At All Costs" will open the "Art-mainstream" program.
This is the story of a model Maya (Kherici herself) working in the French capital who is deported back home to Morocco due to visa problems.
In addition to the film of Kherici, viewers will be shown a new film from the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-duk "Moebius", the melodramatic biopic of Oliver Hirschbiegel "Diana: Love Story" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film of Cannes Film Festival held last May, Abdellatif Kechiche's "Life of Adele".
The only Russian participant of "Art-mainstream" will be the winner of the Kinotavr festival, the film of Alexander Veledinsky "The Geographer Drank His Globe Away" based on the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov.
The lead role of a charming unsuccessful teacher Victor Sluzhkin was played in the film by Konstantin Khabensky, whose work was distinguished with the "Kinotavr" prize.
