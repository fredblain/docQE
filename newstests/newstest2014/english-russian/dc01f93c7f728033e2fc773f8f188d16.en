Russian security agencies know nothing about the group "Brotherly Circle" - New Izvestia
INTERFAX.RU writes about it citing an information source in RF law enforcement agencies.
"After reports of Leps being entered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury into blacklists on suspicion of involvement with the Eurasian crime syndicate 'Brotherly Circle' emerged in the media, we looked through all databases, but we did not detect such a group," said the agency source.
According to him, the distribution of such information helps maintain the myth about the so-called Russian mafia, which supposedly operates abroad.
As "NI" previously had written, yesterday the U.S. Department of the Treasury published on its website a list of supposed members of the criminal group "Brotherly Circle".
Among them the Russian singer Grigory Leps was also named.
He appears in the list as "Grisha", they put out the day before.
They coincide with the data of the popular Russian performer.
The exact name - Grigory Lepsevridze, stage name, place and data of birth are specified.
Besides Leps, another five persons are mentioned there.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and one more native of the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.
In the U.S. they are confident that Grigory Leps, who resides on the island of Phuket, transported money for gangsters on their orders.
To this message was attached a photograph of the singer and was specified all of his data, which correspond to the facts.
Moreover, Leps actually recently bought a home on Phuket.
In the agency they noted that they intend to impose sanctions in relation to Leps.
A person's entry into blacklists of the American Department of the Treasury entails blocking his assets in the U.S. and banning business contacts with him by persons living in the United States.
The assistant of Leps Maya Serikova stated that no notifications have come to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question, is Grigory the one about whom everyone is talking now in connection with the scandal in the U.S."
All that Leps knows is media information.
He personally received no official notifications, although I don't know if they happen in such cases.
"And, of course, all this, on one hand, is ridiculous, but on the other - surprising and unexpected," she stated to RIA Novosti.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live on Phuket, but, as the U.S. Department of the Treasury asserts, he indeed has a home on the Thai island.
She stated that now Leps is on a long tour across the Far East and Siberia, and that the news reached him during a flight to the city of Blagoveschensk.
