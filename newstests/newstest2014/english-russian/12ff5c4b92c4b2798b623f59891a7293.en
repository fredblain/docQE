The speech gene has turned out to be a stimulator for the formation of synapses
Scientists from John Hopkins University and the School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have discovered a protein thanks to which the "speech gene" Foxp2 performs its function, stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The research has been published in Science, and its abstract can be read on the journal's website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was able to be established in 2001 owing to the discovery of a family of several people who could not correctly pronounce words and sometimes even they themselves did not understand each other.
Scientists ascertained that in members of the family the activity of the Foxp2 gene had been disrupted, though the manner in which it performs its function remained unknown.
In new research, biologists have shown that Foxp2 performs at least a portion of its functions as a simulator of the formation of new synapses in the area of the brain associated with speech formation.
It does this owing to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of a search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 proved to be one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, whereas only Foxp2 influences its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 actually influences vocalization was confirmed by scientists in an experiment on mice.
When the activity of the gene was artificially reduced in the animals, they screamed less when separated from mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of emitted sounds also was restored.
Previously interconnection between vocalization and Foxp2 itself was also demonstrated on mice.
Animals in which a human copy of the gene was introduced peeped more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
Thus far, however, scientists do not know whether the function of Foxp2 and, consequently, of SRPX2 controlled by it, is linked with the purely "mechanical" properties of the formation of sounds or with more subtle processes.
