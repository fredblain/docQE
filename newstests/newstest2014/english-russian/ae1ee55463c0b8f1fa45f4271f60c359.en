How much dead celebrities earn - MK in the U.S. MK
The rating of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was headed by Madonna, earning 125 million dollars.
But the deceased Michael Jackson, whose postmortem income from October of 2012 through October of 2013 amounted to 160 million, "outdid" her.
Noticeably behind him are other deceased celebrities who last year "earned" several times less.
Second in the list of the most "prosperous" departed celebrities compiled by Forbes magazine at year's end was Elvis Presley - 55 million per year, and a line lower the author of Peanuts comics Charles Schultz with 37 million.
Besides them, into the first five went Elizabeth Taylor, who was leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein also made it into the list.
