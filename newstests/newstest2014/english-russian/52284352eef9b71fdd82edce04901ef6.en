Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide what a huge pleasure she receives from upbringing her children.
Despite the fact that right now Arbenina spends an especially large amount of time on creative work and social activity, she nonetheless finds the opportunity to busy oneself with Marta and Artyom, and not only spends time on their education, but also entertains them however possible.
Over the past week Diana twice provided an account of her pedagogical talents in front of her admirers.
At first she put out on Facebook a picture on which it is visible how she is teaching her children to read.
And yesterday she spoiled her fans with showing how she dressed up Artyom and Marta for Halloween.
Ready for the broom races! our first Halloween" - so named Diana the picture of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
Which is no wonder, after all they, like no other Russian little boys and little girls, bear a relation to this holiday since they were born in America.
