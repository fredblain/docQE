What will be the result of construction of transport hubs in Moscow
Each year, the capital's authorities promise to develop more and more transport hubs (TH).
There are plans to commission 255 transport hubs before 2020.
Our correspondent found out what the project really entails.
A couple of months ago a construction fence arose near the Smolenskaya metro station on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.
A sign announced ongoing development of a transport hub.
All of this was very strange since no above-ground transport stops near "Smolenskaya" and, consequently, it is impossible to transfer to it.
In order to reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Sadovoe ring road, it is necessary to cover around 130 meters, including an above-ground crossing over Karmanitskiy lane.
Now almost everything is finished at Smolenskaya.
The flower kiosk disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced with stone block.
That is the entire transport hub.
Transport hubs can be planar and extensive, they explain in the press office of the capital's department of transport.
So far there are no extensive transport hubs.
But planar ones involve the construction of parking areas, removal of shopping facilities that inhibit the movement of passengers, creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
In fact, transport specialists do not engage in planar transport hubs, but site improvement professionals from the capital repairs department of the city of Moscow do.
A transport hub is not necessarily an elaborate construction, explains the director of the Institute of Economics for Transportation and Transportation Policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes a roof overhead and a panel notifying about transport arrival time are enough.
Well, for example, they recently opened an entirely full-fledged planar transport hub at the "Yasenevo" metro.
Granted, without awnings, but with intercepting parking areas and panels indicating when a bus will arrive.
But in pursuit of quantity, officials register as transport hubs everything at hand.
As early as 2011 the mayor's office planned to construct only 151 hubs, of which 59 with capital construction.
Now as many as 255 transport hubs are listed in plans up to 2020.
They promise to commission a hundred and fifty of them this year.
Even though there is a transport hub development program in the city, no qualitative criteria are designated, states Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".
They report on the number of facilities, but the quality of the transfer on each of them frequently gets worse.
According to experts, there should be two criteria: firstly - reduction in transfer time, secondly - convenience.
Above all, the capability to change transport mode without going out into the rain.
In Moscow, however, with transport hub development sometimes it turns out exactly opposite.
A striking example is the "VDNKh" metro.
Previously, suburban buses from Yaroslavl highway entered the square in front of the main entrance to the All-Russia Exhibition Center.
Now their stops have been re-located to the opposite side of Yaroslavl highway to Cosmonaut street.
Further from the metro, significantly further from the monorail, though closer to residential buildings.
Even though residents downright did not want a bus terminal under their windows and complained on all possible levels.
Extensive transport hubs in Moscow somehow immediately did not succeed.
They began to build the first of them about five years ago at the "Planernaya" metro.
The project was designed to be exemplary.
And in fact it succeeded as an example of how a transport hub sold out to investors is turned into a banal shopping center.
No, here there are platforms for buses, an awning so as not to walk from the metro station in the rain, and three floors of bus stops.
Granted, they on principle did not provide space to Khimki trolleybuses No.202 and No.203 in the Moscow transport hub.
They were pushed away further from the metro as strangers.
On the other hand, more space was left for trading.
32 stores of only clothes, but generally there is almost everything - from pet goods to a car dealership.
Well, indeed, what if one of the bus passengers needs to buy a new car on the way?
Around here, when they build an extensive transport hub, for some reason a shopping center always results.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when they decided to put part of a parking area on the market.
Now, lively trade is occurring on the third floor of the "Planernaya" transport hub among the parking places marked out on the ground.
Vegetables, seasoning, Chinese jeans, non-Russian conversation and security guards maliciously looking at our photographer.
The transport hub has completely turned into a bazaar.
The thing is, previously there was a market at "Planernaya" metro, but they tore it down.
But in the prefect's office they took pity on vendors and let them onto the intercepting parking area of the transport hub.
Nevertheless, due to high prices it is always empty there.
The most humorous part is that the market was torn down in order to build in its place... the new planar transport hub.
That's the shuffle.
At the Kaluzhskaya metro, the approach distance from the metro vestibule to the bus made up 50 meters, recounts Alexander Morozov.
After construction of the shopping center, allegedly a transport hub, the distance increased to 170 meters.
In order to board the bus, it is necessary to walk through the entire shopping center.
After 22:00, when it is closed, it is necessary to walk around it under the open sky.
By the way, the constructions on Planernaya and Kaluzhskaya will soon seem like roses.
In mid September, the urban planning and land commission of the mayor's office confirmed the planning solutions for the first eight extensive transport hubs.
Four of them will be 25-storied, not counting the two-three underground levels.
The main monster will develop at the Tushino metro, it will have 418.7 thousand square meters of area.
Representatives of the directorate of railway terminals of Russian Railways who are responsible for construction of the transport hub at the metro have already told journalists: stores, hotels and apartments will be available in future multi-story buildings.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-level parking areas will occupy from a third to half of the area.
Let's take as an example "public" garages.
Let's say that a garage with 258 car spaces, which they recently built on International street, has an area of 8,105 square meters.
That means that parking for 2.6 thousand cars at "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" will require approximately 80 thousand "squares".
This is less than a third of the giant that they intend to build there.
Allow one-two floors to go toward all kinds of platforms for buses.
There remains at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.
And that, just a minute, is almost two state department stores.
If the railway folks will build extensive transport hubs at stations and terminals, then the metro folks will absorb the remaining areas.
They also promised that there will be many "functional facilities", including hotels, offices, and even gyms.
By the way, recently in the property department of the city of Moscow they told journalists that they are developing a draft resolution according to which investors will be able to directly contact officials to acquire a site for a transport hub.
Without any tenders.
Because, they say, transportation issues for the city are priority.
An ideal transport hub is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston and Spadina station in Toronto, assures Alexander Morozov.
There, trolleybuses and trams are sent underground to the metro level and the approach distance from the metro car to the tram equals only 50 meters without an exit to the street.
There is no unnecessary vending around.
But Moscow officials are given to extremes.
Either we will not build anything, or we will go as far as build 25 floors with offices and apartments.
