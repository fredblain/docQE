Driving schools will be able to conduct examinations for receiving drivers' licenses
Private companies possessing their own computerized motordrome will be able to hold exams for drivers' licenses.
This is reported by "Kommersant" citing the draft government resolution "On permission to drive vehicles".
As the newspaper writes, currently in Russia there are only around 30 such motordromes.
It is assumed that the results of internal testing will be counted for students of such "privileged" driving schools.
Moreover, every six months the State Automobile Inspectorate will monitor the passing of examinations.
If it turns out that students do not pass more than 30% of exams on theory and more than 20% ground exams on the first try, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements of motordromes contained in the draft government resolution take effect starting November 5, 2014.
The draft also contains the requirements for teaching driving on two-wheeled machinery.
Starting January 1, 2015 owners of motorcycles will have to pass an exam in conditions of city traffic to receive category A licenses.
In addition, starting May 5, 2014 companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign licenses.
Such employees will have to receive Russian licenses after passing the exam.
