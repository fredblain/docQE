Medvedev expects that the SSJ-100 airplane will be supplied to Europe
Russia expects that after strengthening on the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 airplanes will also be supplied to Europe.
"We expect that altogether we will receive such contracts for more than 170 airplanes of similar type," Interfax quotes the words of Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev spoken by him at a press conference with the prime minister of France Jean-Marc Ayrault.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been set up with French colleagues since this is a joint project.
Today we discussed certain financial issues that were related to insurance, but we hope that after this airplane strengthens on the markets of Latin America and the Asian-Pacific region, it will also be supplied to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that some day it will be supplied to France as well," emphasized the Russian prime minister.
SSJ-100 is an airplane built by the company "Sukhoi Civil Aircraft" in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The jetliner was developed based on modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
