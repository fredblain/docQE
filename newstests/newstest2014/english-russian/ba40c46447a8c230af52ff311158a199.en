The U.S. is cutting food assistance benefits for the poor
The food allowance for a family of four persons is being reduced by 36 dollars per month
Starting Friday in the U.S. funding of grocery vouchers known as "food stamps" is being reduced because the corresponding government program is expiring.
Now 36 dollars per month less than before will be allocated for the food assistance benefits of a family of four persons, say officials.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
Based on data from the agency Reuters, in the 2012 fiscal year benefits per person amounted to 133 dollars per month on average.
Expenses on food assistance in the U.S. grew to 80 billion dollars per year due to the growth of unemployment and of prices on food products.
Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food assistance issued via "food stamps", bearing such a name from earlier times when they had the shape of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded in order to stimulate growth of the economy and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress demand to carry out further cuts in funds allocated for the program, declaring that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
Owners of grocery stores throughout America are worried that cuts will lead to reduced expenditures of consumers.
U.S. congressmen continue to debate on how to possibly cut even more financing of the government.
