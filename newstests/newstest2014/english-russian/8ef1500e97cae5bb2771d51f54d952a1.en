U.S. Secretary of State: intelligence agencies at times "went too far" when gathering data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that when gathering data and wiretapping, American intelligence agencies at times "went too far", nonetheless the politician noted that information about the wiretaps of 70 million people that emerged in the media does not reflect reality.
I assure you that innocent people did not suffer during this process, but an attempt to gather information did exist.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was legally inappropriate.
I acknowledge it, as the president also acknowledges... and we will see to it that this does not happen in the future, the AFP cites the secretary of state.
