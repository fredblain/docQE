An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31 near the city of Kokimbo in the central part of Chile, reports the agency Reuters.
The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, as specified on the website of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
Tremors were registered at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 Moscow time).
So far nothing is being reported regarding victims or destruction caused by the underground tremors.
Let us recall that Chile is located on one of the most seismically active regions of Earth, therefore earthquakes of various intensity there are not uncommon.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
At that time, an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.8 and the tsunami it caused resulted in the death of 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
Moreover, the most powerful earthquake in modern history occurred in Chile: in 1960 a magnitude of 9.5 was registered there.
More than five thousand people perished as a result of that natural disaster.
