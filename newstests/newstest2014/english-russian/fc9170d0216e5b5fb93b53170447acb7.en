Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with local Taliban
Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban movement.
This was reported by the embassy of that country in Great Britain, where the prime minister of Pakistan Navaz Sharif is visiting.
The head of the government of Pakistan made the announcement about negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed issues of the relations of Pakistan and India, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The prime minister reported that dialog with the Taliban movement has begun, says the announcement of the embassy of Pakistan in London.
- He said that he hopes and prays that the dialog starts to work in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan," diplomats added.
Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, however they operate independently from it in the northwestern regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistani Taliban are striving to create an Islamic state.
Previously the government of Islamabad had made attempts to begin negotiations with local Taliban, however the movement rejected the dialog.
It declared that it would agree to negotiations only under the condition that the authorities withdraw troops deployed in regions where Taliban operate back to their permanent bases, as well as free detained islamists from prisons.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, the prime minister of Great Britain David Cameron, head of the Pakistani government and Afghan president Hamid Karzai in London held a trilateral meeting where they discussed the prospects of a peace process in Afghanistan.
