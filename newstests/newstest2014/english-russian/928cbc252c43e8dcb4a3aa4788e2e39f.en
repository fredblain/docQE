The first boutique of Igor Gulyaev opened in Moscow
On October 23 the opening of the first flagship boutique of Igor Gulyaev took place in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to a wide audience for his magnificent products made from luxury fur.
And now even more fashion worshipers will be able to value them - in Moscow finally opened his first boutique, for the occasion of which the designer threw a party in dolce vita style.
I am certain that the most beautiful women live in Russia.
For that reason I am especially happy that my store opened in Moscow.
It is not merely an office, but a place where there really is a part of me.
Precisely with these words Igor cut the red ribbon and invited all who wished... to try on appealing models!
