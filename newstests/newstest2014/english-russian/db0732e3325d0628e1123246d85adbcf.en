A Just Russia proposes to equate defamation of patriotic sentiments with extremism
For legislative protection of patriotic sentiments of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, "A Just Russia" proposes to equate defamation of patriotic sentiments to extremist activity and punish it with five years of prison.
As the newspaper "Izvestia" reports, such amendments to legislation prepared by the deputy chairman of the Duma committee on energy Oleg Mikheev have already been submitted to the Supreme Court and the administration for decision.
The author of the amendments proposes that patriotic sentiments be understood as the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, a responsible attitude toward its fate, respect to its history and culture.
As Mikheev indicates, in domestic legislation there are sanctions against desecration of the formal symbols of government authority - the flag and emblem.
However, according to the member of parliament, protection of Russians whose sentiments also may be offended by defamation of government symbols and other displays of disrespect to our country, has been insufficiently elaborated in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the discussions expanding every year on the eve of Victory Day, when certain persons in the media venture to cast doubt on the heroic feat of the people of USSR in the fight against the fascists.
The day before the nationwide holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real bacchanalia unfolds.
Exercising their wit and "alternative viewpoint" of history, certain publicists come to reasonings about, they say, what a pity that the cultured Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider such to be absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual staple" of the nation," resents Oleg Mikheev.
In addition, according to Mikheev, there are a lot more patriotic-spirited than religious people in Russia, moreover the law punishes insults of the sentiments of religious believers, yet it is possible to insult patriotic sentiments virtually without punishment.
According to the people's representative, it is necessary to equate defamation of patriotic sentiments to extremist activity and prescribe an appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
Draft legislation stipulates punishment for insulting patriotic sentiments: from a fine of 100 thousand to 5 years imprisonment.
