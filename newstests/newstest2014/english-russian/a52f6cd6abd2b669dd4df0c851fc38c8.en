Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2,200 rubles
Starting tomorrow, hovercraft will begin to carry tourists from Blagoveschensk to Heihe.
This means additional expenses for those who wish to travel to China
A ticket on a panther traditionally costs significantly more than a motor ship.
As reported in the reference service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of a regular ticket will equal 2,200 rubles.
Travel via the luxury lounge will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, this season tickets have not become more expensive: Panthers carried tourists for the same price last spring and a year ago in the fall.
