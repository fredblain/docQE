In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford automobile factory in Vsevolozhsk.
As they say in trade unions, all of the dismissed received compensation.
However, the issue of the reduction of industrial production in the region is becoming much more poignant than the problems of workers.
Deputy of the regional legislative assembly Aleksei Etmanov at a meeting said that they cut around 600 people at the factory of the company Ford in Vsevolozhsk.
According to him, this occurred as early as September: at that time in line with a program of voluntarily dismissal, which was developed together with the trade union of the organization, around 600 people resigned from the factory.
Workers who decided to resign voluntarily were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
Due to that, the overwhelming majority left their jobs voluntarily.
However, according to Etmanov, such an amount of people is an entire night shift.
I think that the matter will not be limited to this.
However, in the coming two years authorities do not plan on undertaking any programs to support regional enterprises that are in a difficult situation," he explained, adding that when adopting a budget the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large job cuts.
At Ford, they are not denying nor confirming this information.
We are awaiting a response from the company, and, as soon as it emerges, we will definitely publicize it.
Talk of cutting workers at the Ford factory in Vsevolozhsk has gone on for a long time.
For example, company plans to dismiss 600 people became known as early as September.
Previously the factory announced a suspension of automobile production.
The reason they gave at the factory was a drop in demand for Ford automobiles in Russia.
According to Petrostat, results of nine months of 2013 show that the industrial output in the Leningrad region decreased by 5.4%.
Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
