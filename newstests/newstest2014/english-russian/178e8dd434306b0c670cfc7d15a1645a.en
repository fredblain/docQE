The website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia was restored after the attack of Ukrainian hackers
Operation of the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia has been restored after the morning cyber attack, reports the agency's press office.
According to the vice chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for informational and administrative issues Taimar Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the website was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly fixed everything, at this time operation of the site has been restored.
"The damage inflicted on the ministry is minimal," Peterkop said to the publication Postimees.
According to Peterkop, so far it is early to talk about who organized the attacks.
"We will certainly analyze the causes of the incident and we will draw conclusions from that, but it is impossible to completely prevent similar incidents," he admitted.
Let us recall that on November 1 the group Anonymous Ukraine posted an online message in which it confirmed the hacker attack on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia and opposed the partnership of Ukraine and NATO.
We want the leaders of NATO to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We must not be servants of NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of member countries of NATO.
Ukraine does not need the NATO alliance.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia either.
Ukraine must not be anyone's slave.
We stand for an independent Ukraine.
"Hands off Ukraine," it says in the announcement of Anonymous.
Previously the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that a marine company from the Feodosia detached battalion of marines will take part in command staff exercises of NATO reaction forces Steadfast Jazz-2013.
