Due to new rules introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of trucks sit in queue on the Russian border almost a week already.
Today Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and to set up portable toilets
Hundreds of trucks have accumulated at border points upon entry into Russia.
This situation arose due to a change in the rules of customs processing of freight.
Ukrainian border patrol guards and customs officers confirm: the line is caused by the Russian side, which did not warn about the innovations in advance.
Since October 28 customs agencies of Russia have begun to employ additional measures to guarantee delivery of freight, - reported deputy manager of Eastern customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new document standard is being applied in countries that have joined the convention on international transport.
Entry points work in an accelerated regime.
A correspondent of "FACTS" visited the border and talked to truck drivers who ended up hostages of the situation.
Prices at the roadside store-cafe at the "Novoazovsk" entry point rise each day just like the line of trucks.
Trucks stand in several rows that spread approximately two kilometers.
The customs terminal Novoazovsk-Veselo-Voznesenka secures one of the most important transport vectors from southern Ukraine to international motorways.
From here freights are sent to Stavropol Krai of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight they still let through, but later they introduced the new rules, - complains long-distance truck driver Aleksei Golovanev (on the photo), who hauls freight in transit through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and sleeps in his vehicle almost a week already.
According to the new rules, I need an additional packet of documents and payment of freight insurance to cross the border .
The amount depends on the value of the freight and the distance it will be hauled.
Minimum coverage 4.5−5 thousand rubles (approximately 1,100−1,300 hryvnia).
Those who will drive a short distance (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a freight valued at up to 50 thousand dollars will pay somewhere around 15 thousand rubles (3,800 hryvnia) and drive on.
But the rest are stuck - after all no one has such big money with them!
Imagine, if a driver hauls freight for a sum of only four thousand dollars, but even to Moscow he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for transit!
There are no facilities for survival at the border, - complains long-distance truck drivers arranging themselves to eat near their vehicles.
At roadside stores and cafes it is always expensive anyway, but we have never encountered such prices like here!
Salespeople got their bearings and quickly jacked them up: a long loaf costs 15 hryvnia, seven hryvnia - cup of coffee, 25 hryvnia - bowl of soup.
But there is only one cafe.
And no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we also go there to the toilet.
No wash, no shave...
I can even go a week without leaving the vehicle, my wife prepared me everything for the road.
I can last a week, - another long-distance truck driver Victor Skotarenko comforts himself.
But will the queue get to my vehicle within a week?
What is your price for one and a half liters of water? - we inquire in the only border store.
We have for 11 and for 15 hryvnia.
What, is the bottle crystal or the water infused in silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take it while there is still something, - retorts the saleswoman.
After they began to expose the situation in the media, authorities of the region turned their attention to the dire situation of the Ukrainian drivers.
The leaders of the Amvrosievska and Novoazovsk district government administrations received an order to provide drinking water to everyone who is standing idle in queue on the Ukrainian-Russian border, - announced the acting chairman of the Donetsk regional government administration Sergei Dergunov.
Now ambulance teams are on duty at entry points.
Also portable toilets will be set up for convenience of the people.
According to an official, the problem associated with the queues will be resolved already in the coming days.
As reports the press office of the Donetsk regional government administration, as of October 31, at international entry points "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk", 32 and 68 vehicles, respectively, stood idle.
"FACTS" will monitor the development of the situation.
