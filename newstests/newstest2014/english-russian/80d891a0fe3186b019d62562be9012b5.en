Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse of prices for goods after the signing of the association with the European Union
The prime minister of Ukraine Nikolai Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will significantly decrease after the country signs the association agreement with the European Union.
He stated this while chatting with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, among which are, among others, customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the enactment of the provision on the free trade zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will significantly decrease.
And this will mean that prices should also decrease.
"This is in respect to goods that come from countries of the EU," wrote Azarov.
In respect to other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be mediated.
But, nevertheless, there should not be an increase in prices there either.
Therefore, the messages on billboards that have recently appeared in our country quite a lot, saying the association with the EU is a rise in prices, this is not entirely true, or if we speak more accurately - entirely not true," summarized Azarov.
