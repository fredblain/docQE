Snowden agreed to provide testimony on the wiretapping of Merkel
Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Stroebele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the conversation a question arose, whether Snowden can be interrogated as a witness by the German Prosecutor's Office on the case of the possible wiretapping of the telephone of the German chancellor by U.S. intelligence agencies.
Snowden expressed willingness to provide the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He clearly conveyed, - said Hans-Christian Stroebele, - that he knows quite a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency headed by Kieth Alexander has obstructed all of his movements, Snowden is willing to come to Germany.
However, first it is necessary to clearly define all conditions of his arrival. .
Meanwhile, American lawmakers are beginning to take measures in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs.
