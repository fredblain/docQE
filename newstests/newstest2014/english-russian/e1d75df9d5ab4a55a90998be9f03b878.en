A snowboarder was specially photographed for an Olympic banknote
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued into circulation a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi where already this winter the Olympics will take place.
The face value of the banknote is 100 rubles.
But online bloggers are already actively mocking the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic banknote on October 30 they drew attention to the fact that the image of the snowboarder from the banknote can be found in image banks.
Specifically - in the free photo archive StockExchange, where the photo in question is dated 2005.
That same photo is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website "Megaobzor" on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it was already used in an advertisement for RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote was designed in a dark blue-light blue color gamut.
At one side a snowboarder flying over Sochi is displayed,  at the other - the view of an Olympic stadium and the Firebird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, winner in the competition among students of Saint Petersburg's Academy of Arts n.a. Repin.
At the presentation it was noted that several sports were examined - downhill skiing, freestyle and ski jumping, but in the end snowboarding was selected since it is a relatively young type of sport.
According to an "Izvestia" source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to public opinion relating to the wide distribution of an image of a snowboarder from an Olympic banknote and it is now studying the situation.
However in Gosznak they are not too worried by the buzz surrounding the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service of Gosznak Natalia Nikiforova told "Izvestia" that all discussions regarding plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote is turned to the right, on online photographs - to the left, specified Nikiforova.
The person in the photo session to create the banknote was photographed from various points, then the final image was selected, with a typical pose of a snowboarder on it.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote since the artist received payment for the work.
According to experts, the discussion surrounding the image on the Olympic banknote is entirely positive.
The recognizability of the image on the banknote is a plus for its promotion, - believes the CEO of NP "RusBrand" Aleksei Popovichev.
It is rather difficult to prove one hundred percent resemblance of the images on the banknote and in photo banks, therefore claims to dispute intellectual property for this image will unlikely arise.
The first ever Olympic banknote appeared in China - a commemorative banknote for 10 yuan was issued for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
