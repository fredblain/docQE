Deductions for capital repairs of the building will appear in utility payment documents of Voronezh residents as a new line of expenses.
According to the most approximate calculations, from 100 to 400 rubles per month must be additionally paid for a standard two-room apartment starting after the New Year.
The regional government will determine the precise rate.
On the other hand, the residents themselves will decide on painting the entrance, cleaning up the stair wells, or even replacing the elevator.
Deputies of the regional Duma approved this law.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, noted: "Order must be imposed in this matter as well - prioritize capital repairs of buildings, not accumulate funds in management companies, which here are frequently registered either in Moscow, or in Orenburg, or somewhere else, this will be the establishment of government control over the expenditure of funds that residents collect for repairs of multi-apartment buildings."
Participatory construction is now also under control of the government.
The law protecting against swindlers was approved by the regional Duma in its final reading.
The document did not arise out of thin air.
4.5 thousand people suffered from dishonest developers in our region.
The problems of the majority were able to be resolved.
In fact, the new law prescribes the rights and responsibilities for all participants of equity construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, stated: "It is no secret that in this area abuses have also begun related to the fact that in '98 the same shareholders got hit, and the same shareholders in the 2000's."
People have begun to make money on it, these two laws were adopted in order to close the loophole, among other things.
It was decided to build a temporary residence center near Voronezh for foreign citizens who are subject to deportation.
The regional parliament adopted such a law not only due to pressure from the federation.
The region has more than enough problems related to illegal migrants.
Specifically, last year slightly more than 100 thousand foreigners completed migration registration.
But only one in five registered official permission to work.
Where the others work and whether they pay taxes is highly questionable.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, recounted: "They violated legislation, but are not criminals.
There is no trial, but deportation is necessary - they need to be held somewhere.
The federation adopted such a solution to arrange such places using regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, such a place has been determined - it is the Old Olshanka of Semiluksky district.
Well, but finally the regional parliament allotted new benefits to parents with multiple children.
Firstly, families raising 5 or more children are fully exempt from the transport tax.
In this case, the budget loses 3.5 million - but the parents with multiple children save just as much.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt 3 or more children will be provided housing subsidies beginning in the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters at a price of 30 thousand per meter.
For example, a family of 6 persons - papa, mama, biological child and 3 adopted.
For them, according to regulations, the government will acquire housing with an area of 108 square meters for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
It is a perfectly acceptable option for the left bank or the Southwest microdistrict.
Well, and in the regional center one can buy an entire cottage for that amount.
