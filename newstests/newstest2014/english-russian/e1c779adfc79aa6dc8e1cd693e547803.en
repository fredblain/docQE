Venezuela will establish an exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency - the bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported on November 1 by the agency Bloomberg citing the government decree.
Foreign travelers will be permitted to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand American dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars they acquired in the country when departing.
The precise rate of bolivars against the dollar will be established later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, on the black market one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the start of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela amounted to almost 50 percent.
The minister of the oil industry and vice president of economics Rafael Ramirez on October 18 announced that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial data, which the agency cited, Caracas could nonetheless decide to reduce the rate of the national currency after municipal elections in December.
The policy of restraining prices on products and goods of mass consumption, as well as the high level of over-regulation of the Venezuelan economy have led to a deficit of a number of goods and to the functioning of a black currency market.
In the spring of this year, mass media reported that a shortage of toilet paper was noted in Venezuela.
