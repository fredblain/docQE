A scandalous video has made its way to the police
The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, well-known for his scandals and openly reckless antics, was caught smoking crack.
The police of the Canadian city has announced that it possesses the corresponding video recording and is prepared to begin an investigation on the city's mayor.
CNN reports that the latter declared that he will not resign from his post .
Information that authorities have proof of consumption of narcotics by Rob Ford has appeared on the Toronto police website.
The head of local law enforcement agencies Bill Blair held a press conference on this issue.
The sheriff said that he is not authorized to share the particular video clips with the public, however he guarantees their existence.
According to Blair, the compromising video of Rob Ford was discovered during an anti-narcotics raid conducted by law enforcement officers in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had previously written about the existence of this video, however until recently there had been no confirmations.
The mayor himself does not provide any comments on this issue.
He only says that he is not guilty of anything and does not intend to resign.
The video recording discovered by the police is one piece of evidence in the case of the 35-year-old friend of Ford, Alexander Lisi, who is accused of soft narcotics dealing, extortion, illegall income acquisition, as well as criminal conspiracy.
At times Lisi served as the driver of Rob Ford.
City residents have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
The latter repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public while drunk, took the liberty of making racist and sexist statements.
