New terminals will appear in the Moscow metro.
But they will sell tickets to passengers not for money, but for squats.
One ride valued at 30 rubles will cost the potential passenger 30 squats.
The number of squats will be counted by a special device using modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS citing the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first machine will be installed at "Exhibition" station on November 8, 2013.
The president of the Russian Olympic Committee Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champion gymnasts Aleksei Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova will take part in the presentation of the new ticketing sport-terminals.
