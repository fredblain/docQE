Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the upcoming Italian championship match against Parma.
As reports Football Italia, the trainer staff decided not to include him in the game bid in order to save him for the match against "Real" in the 4th round of the group stage of the Champions League.
Lichtsteiner, Vuchinich and Pepe will not take part in the duel with Parma as well.
However, forward Fabio Quagliarella has recovered from injury and is ready to play.
