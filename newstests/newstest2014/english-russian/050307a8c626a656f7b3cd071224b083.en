Bashkiria can put grain up for tender no earlier than the beginning of 2014
The Republic's Minister of Agriculture Nikolai Kovalenko believes that during government purchasing interventions Bashkiria can put grain up for tender no earlier than the beginning of 2014.
As of today, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
So far the market price is higher, and there is demand.
"It is possible that grain will be put up for tender after the New Year," he announced at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that this year sowing of agricultural crops for the 2013 harvest made up 3.1 million hectares, including acreage of grain crops of 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% higher than last year.
For the harvest of 2014, 550 thousand hectares have been sown (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
Acreage for winter wheat and triticale has been increased, rye remained at the previous level.
