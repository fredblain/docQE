The agency "Rosbalt" was deprived of media status for obscenity
On October 31 the Moscow Municipal Court resolved to annul the license of registration of the agency "Rosbalt", writes "Lenta".
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of media status for systematic and blatant violations of the law on mass media.
A disagreeable precedent was created during the trial: the court considered it feasible to close the media outlet, virtually depriving the agency of the right to put forth counterarguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
Closed joint-stock company "Information Agency Rosbalt" was founded in Saint Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
Also with the agency operate representative offices in countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001 "Rosbalt" has developed and functioned as a federal informational-analytical agency.
By the middle of the 2000's the agency was entered into the list of the most recognizable private Internet media resources in Russia.
Moreover, "Rosbalt" always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of exclusive publications of the agency composed (and compose to this day) news items with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Conversations about the proximity of the publication to security structures continued throughout the existence of the agency.
While "Rosbalt" possessed an extensive base of sources in various agencies, the fact that Natalya Chaplina - wife of Victor Cherkesov - stood at the head of the project also spoke in favor of such assumptions.
Moreover, the role of Chaplina in the management of "Rosbalt" is not fully clear: most commonly they call her "project manager".
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, chief editor - Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently "Rosbalt" did not figure in the ratings of federal media resources - not by citation, not by audience.
In October the agency occupied 25th place in the visibility rating of websites of Russian media based on the version of LiveInternet.
Based on that same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the website rosbalt.ru amounts to approximately 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - approximately three million unique visitors.
In the list of the most popular materials over the last five months - news items on the powerlessness of the Kremlin in relation to Ukraine, death of the soloist of the group "King and Fool", pogroms in the capital's Biryulevo.
The conflict of "Rosbalt" with Roskomnadzor began in July of 2013 when amendments to the law on media prohibiting journalists from obscenities took effect.
The agency discovered prohibited vocabulary in two video clips published on the website of the agency ("The horseman from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot desecrated oil derricks").
What came next the parties describe differently.
Based on the discovered video materials, Roskomnadzor accused "Rosbalt" of blatant and systematic violation of the law on media and took legal action demanding to take away the agency's license.
At "Rosbalt" they declared that the claims of the agency were unjustified: firstly, the clips were not editorial materials, secondly, the obscenities in them were masked, and, thirdly, the clips were removed from the website immediately after the warning.
Representatives of the agency appealed the claims of Roskomnadzor in a magistrate court - and when on October 22, 2013 the Moscow Municipal Court accepted the claim of Roskomnadzor, examination of those complaints still continued.
However, already on the 25th the magistrate judge reached a decision not in favor of "Rosbalt": chief editor Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offenses and was fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each clip.
Evidently this is what predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow Municipal Court - if we dismiss the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier.
On October 31 the court reached a decision to annul the certificate of registration of "Rosbalt", in effect depriving the agency of the status of a media outlet.
It cannot be said that "Rosbalt" over the course of this confrontation was all alone.
Deputies of the State Duma supported the agency (a declaration addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation).
The unlawfulness of closing the publication was declared by the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the presidential Council on Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even provided him with certain guarantees that the matter will not go as far as revocation of the license.
The trial of "Rosbalt" demonstrated: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be for a media outlet in Russia today is a huge question.
