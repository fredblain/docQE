There is no point being a vegan in Siberia: a hothouse tomato will not replace soup
A correspondent from RIA Novosti explained why vegetarianism does not suit life in Siberia.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they could not endure the winter without damage to health, and no hothouse tomatoes will compensate them, believe Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors surveyed on the eve of Vegetarian Day.
Drink liters of oil
Strict vegetarianism, when they abstain not only from meat and fish, but also from milk, honey, eggs, is becoming a popular way of life.
However, doctors-nutritionists are confident that to follow such strict norms in nutrition in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia is at the least unhealthy.
A total rejection of animal products is harmful.
In animal proteins there are essential amino acids that are very difficult to compensate with vegetables.
It is absolutely necessary to include at least milk or eggs into a diet," assures nutritionist Marina Bogai.
She cites as an example fish containing the essential fatty acid Omega-3.
The vegetable oil most rich in it is made of flax.
"In order to consume it in the amounts required for a human, it is necessary to drink liters of it!" says the nutritionist.
Medical professionals are confident that residents of Siberia need to give special attention to diet in the winter.
During this season, vegetarianism is especially dubious.
In our actual living conditions, high demands are placed on food.
Increased caloric content is needed not to freeze.
"If a person restricts his animal products, he will fall short of that caloric content accordingly," says the specialist.
Doctor-nutritionist Olga Poznyak agrees with this.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits is not a solution.
It is better for a person to eat predominately products that were raised in the region of residence or there where he was born.
The genetic code is configured for better assimilation and digestion of these products.
And in winter people do not want to gnaw on a cucumber, but hot soup or something else more nourishing," the doctor explains her view.
According to her, out of what vegans can eat, really healthy are various cereals, croups, legumes, local vegetables, apples remaining in winter, frozen berries.
But this is unequivocally insufficient for good nourishment.
According to doctor-gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, in the bodies of Siberians the level of vitamins is sufficient only from the middle of August through the middle of September.
A full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees in a day and snow lies in May, is not appropriate.
The body needs energy for life, and that is, above all, fat," states the medical professional.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children are growing, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
But by adhering to vegetarianism, we provide them inadequately.
Pregnant women also need high-protein food, vitamins and minerals on the menu.
"Vegans do not receive enough of them," assures Bogai.
Arifulina says that an adult person is free to choose whatever he likes, "to play with the toys that he wants".
He has an already formed body, skeleton, organs.
But children nonetheless must be nourished adequately.
If parents deprive him of some kinds of minerals or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, this is simply a violation of the child's rights.
"You will not be able to restore tomorrow deficiencies of some or other substances for development of the brain, vision, bones," she says.
All surveyed expert medical professionals agree on the low quality of winter-grown hothouse and imported vegetables and fruits.
What they import to us and what is grown in hothouses contains less minerals essential to us than (grown) on open ground.
"The quality of products is not right," says Bogai.
Arifulina also notes that imported and hothouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to gather a large harvest harms quality.
"Apples do not become brown when cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and grow moldy, tomatoes are tasteless and non-aromatic," the medical professional cites examples, adding that they are most likely crammed with an excessive amount of fertilizers.
And they become providers not of vitamins, but of cellulose.
The head of the laboratory of the Siberian physics and technological institute of agricultural issues, candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk does not agree with this.
She says that with the correct approach and adherence to all norms and requirements, it is possible to grow wholesome vegetables in hothouses.
If they try to force out more from a square meter, then, of course, they also begin to water more frequently, and overfeed plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too much nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and not sweet," she explains, adding that the issue of quality primarily depends on the conscience of the producer.
