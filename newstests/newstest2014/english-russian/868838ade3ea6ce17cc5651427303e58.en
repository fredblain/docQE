The scheduled meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen Region took place at the Yalutorovsk automobile factory.
As part of the event, there was a presentation of a new line of production of electric-welded steel tubes.
As the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov related, in 2011 with the emergence of a new owner, marketing research was conducted to study the market for selling steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It was found that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electric-welded tubes per month.
Then a decision was made to change the profile of the factory and install within it equipment for their production.
Already this year more than 7 thousand tons of manufactured products have been shipped.
Investments in the factory made up more than 120 million rubles, - recounted Denis Gribanov.
In October a new mill was launched, which helps augment the product mix.
The factory produces small tube sections that are used for greenhouse facilities, small-scale construction and the furniture industry, as well as large ones for the construction industry.
We plan to reach a production level of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will make up around 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to a different type of activity, the number of employees at the plant has not been reduced - now it amounts to 157 people, when new equipment is purchased there are plans to increase personnel by more than 50 employees.
Retraining of staff is underway at the plant, and necessary specialists are being selected from those already available.
Next year it is planned to commission a new unit for slitting steel with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will help reduce the cost of products, as well as another mill with a tube production speed of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014 at the plant they intend to master the production of tubes that are used in housing and utilities infrastructure.
Plant management is aiming to cover up to 70 percent of Tyumen region's demand for these products.
Deputy director of the department of investment policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing production managers, recommended putting greater emphasis on modernizing machine-building plants.
Also directed at this are forms of government support of industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans to purchase new equipment and expenses on its leasing.
This year 150 million rubles have been allocated for these objectives, two thirds of this amount have already been spent.
The last committee that will examine subsidy agreements are accepting documents from plants until November 15.
In addition, expenses on the participation of local producers in international fairs are reimbursed by the budget.
For next year, the budget provides funds in the amount of 150 million rubles that may be used to compensate leasing payments and loans to acquire new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million for energy saving programs.
Funds for reimbursing ordered and paid equipment that is produced in the south of Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex will be reduced to 72 million rubles.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, ultimately this form of support will end since the motive of its introduction was compensation of the extraction tax that oil companies paid into the regional budget.
Presently they are not doing this and subsidies are becoming direct expenditure obligations of the region.
Accordingly, the regional government considers direct support of industrial plants to be priority, and not financing of the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many plant managers expressed concern in connection with the developing situation in relations with oil companies.
A subsidy for equipment purchased by them is a competitive advantage of industry in the south of Tyumen region, and if it is canceled it will be difficult to compete in price with the temperate zone of Russia where the work force is cheaper.
In addition, the issue is unclear regarding the succession of the new owner of TNK-BP - the company "Rosneft", which so far is not placing its orders at Tyumen plants.
The agreement on implementing the Uvatskiy project expires in 2013, and requests for its extension have not been received.
At present, plants in the south of the region that specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector cannot form a portfolio of orders for next year.
The open-ended question remains, will taxes from oil produced in the Uvatskiy region proceed to the budget of the region or will they be paid based on the place of registration of the new owner of the fields?
