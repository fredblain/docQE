The goalkeeper of "Neftekhimik" Matt Dalton declined to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the job as coach of Nizhnekamtsi.
The goalkeeper believes that the acting head trainer Dmitry Balmin holds a lot of authority with the players and will handle his responsibilities.
Let us recall that today Neftekhimik dismissed Krikunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the firing of Vladimir Krikunov, RIA Novosti cites Dalton.
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will handle the responsibilities placed upon him - I have no doubt about that.
He holds a lot of authority on the team, a big future certainly awaits this young specialist.
