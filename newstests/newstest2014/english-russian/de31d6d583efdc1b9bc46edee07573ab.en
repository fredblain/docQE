"Bavaria" defender David Alaba became the best athlete of Austria in 2013, reports the official website of the bundesliga.
In this contest he overtook representatives of winter sports, who traditionally become the best in the country.
Downhill skier Marcel Hirscher took second place, and the third was ski jumper Gregor Schlierenzauer.
Last season the 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian origin helped his team win in the Champions League, the championships and Cup of Germany, as well as in the UEFA Super Cup.
