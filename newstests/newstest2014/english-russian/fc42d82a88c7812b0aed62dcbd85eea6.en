Experienced Italian workers make way for the young
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
Data published Wednesday showed that now 12.5% of country residents are unemployed.
Situation has not been this bad since the Second World War.
This indicator is several times higher among the youth.
40.4% of residents between the ages of 15 and 24 years have no employment.
According to Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement of elderly workers.
Such an experiment is already being conducted by the largest energy company in the country, and the adopted laws allow regional authorities to provide for a portion of early retirement for experienced workers.
However, on the other hand, the common European problem of an aging population awaits Italy.
And economists are not sure that the plan with premature rotation of staff is paying off.
