Due to mischief of evil spirits several schools and a hospital had to be closed
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province Southern Matabeleland had to be closed because students were attacked by... goblins.
As the local elder recounted, children fell into panic, and it proved impossible to continue studies.
The story of goblins may sound like the fabrication of a child for a European, however in Africa it is quite a serious argument for closing a school.
Adults also fear evil spirits.
In summer, for example, in Zimbabwe a hospital was closed because goblins also attacked medical personnel.
