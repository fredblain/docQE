Dmitry Medvedev: RF GDP growth rates are insufficient for growth of the nation
Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev regards as insufficient for the RF the growth rates of its GDP and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms for crediting business and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovations, reports Reuters.
We planned this year a growth of GDP near 3%, perhaps even a little more.
In reality it will be a little less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of the recession in a wide range of countries of Europe seemingly not too bad, but for us this is little because the economic basis is also not so powerful as in a wide range of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian business receive good loans at a good price - this is the first thing that definitely needs to be done," emphasized the head of the government.
