The EU is preparing measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a backup plan to supply Ukraine with gas and to reach an agreement with the IMF for an emergency loan if Russia undertakes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
Negotiations are being conducted with the IMF for a standby loan, and another EU official who is directly involved in the negotiations has stated that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine could also receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters have doubts about whether Ukraine and the IMF can overcome their longstanding disagreements regarding the terms of financing.
Another organization that doubts the possibility of enacting the reforms required for such assistance is the international rating agency S&P, which on Friday lowered Ukraine's sovereign credit rating by one level, from B to B-.
However, representatives of the EU are saying that the IMF may show some flexibility in their loan terms after taking into account Ukraine's circumstances.
In addition to its plan to support the country financially, the EU has a backup option to supply Ukraine with gas, most deliveries of which are currently coming from Russia.
This could possibly include gas from Nord Stream or reverse deliveries from Slovakia.
According to officials, the latter option above would be the most feasible and acceptable method in case Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that such a method involving reverse deliveries to Ukraine could only be used for a few weeks and would likely lead to reduced deliveries to other regions.
"EU countries and the Ukrainians are conducting negotiations on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine could import gas from other sources instead of Russia, or from the same source but via other delivery routes," noted a source from Reuters.
