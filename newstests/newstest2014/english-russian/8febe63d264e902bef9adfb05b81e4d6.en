The head of Dagestan hears notes of extremism in the hymn of Kuban
The football match between "Anzhi" and "Kuban" resulted in a political conflict between authorities of Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the hymn of Kuban began to sound different.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday motioned Republic parliament members to take legal action because the hymn of Krasnodar Territory supposedly resounds with appeals for interethnic discord, in particular calls for war with "infidels".
Take the hymn of Krasnodar Territory, they approved this hymn in our generation in 1995.
This is a shame, and no one is taking this up.
"About you here remembering, like about native mother, to the enemy, to the infidel we go for mortal combat" - why write such words in a hymn, bait some believers against other believers," chairman of parliament Khizri Shikhsaidov expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov.
