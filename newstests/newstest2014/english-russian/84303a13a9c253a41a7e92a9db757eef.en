Syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons
Syria destroyed all declared capacities for production of chemical weapons, acknowledged the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament Damascus completed the day before the established deadline.
Before November 1 Syria had to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities intended for preparing chemical warfare agents for use, reports the BBC.
Destruction of the stocks of poisonous substances themselves or their chemical components must be completed by the middle of 2014.
According to a representative of OPCW, currently the poisonous agents are located in sealed depots.
International inspectors headed to Syria after, according to the U.S., more than 1,400 people died during a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21.
The main objective of the inspectors was to not lose time - in order to not allow Syrian authorities to produce more chemical weapons - and destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and loading ammunition.
Now they will attentively observe these production capacities in order to not allow their repair.
The next milestone - mid-November: by that time the OPCW and Syrians must agree to a detailed plan for destroying the already existing stocks of poisonous substances.
There are many questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide equipment for this?
All Syrian declarations will be thoroughly checked by western intelligence agencies.
They will readily recommend to the inspectors new facilities for inspection if there will be reasons to suspect that Damascus is not fully forthcoming.
The U.S. believes that this bombardment was conducted by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that it is the work of Syrian rebels.
The world community required from Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement achieved through the mediation of Russia, - to destroy or disable all capacities for the production of rounds, poisonous gases and liquids and for loading rounds with those substances.
Now, when this phase is over, the next step must be to destroy the chemical weapons already existing in the Syrian army.
It is assumed that in this arsenal may be more than 1,000 tons of neuroparalytic poisonous substances, skin blistering mustard gas and other banned chemical substances stored in several dozen different places.
For its destruction it is essential that the OPCW and Syrian authorities for a start agree on a schedule of actions - two weeks are allocated for this.
The supervisor of field operations of the OPCW Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors "personally observed the destruction of equipment".
"They now have no capability to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapons," he said.
The statement of the OPCW says that inspectors visited 21 of 23 facilities in Syria and made sure that factories producing rounds and poisonous substances either were destroyed or disabled.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to conduct an inspection there, it says in the document, but the equipment from there was transported and inspected by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was "especially difficult" since it was necessary to work under conditions of an ongoing conflict.
In the beginning of October the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, so far inspectors found no time to celebrate this - they were too busy with work.
