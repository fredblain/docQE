A politician in Turkey went on a hunger strike in opposition to walls on the border with Syria
In mid October, authorities began construction of a dividing wall near the city of Nusaybin in southeast Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurd party BDP came out harshly against the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin near the Syrian border, Aishe Gokkan went on a hunger strike, protesting against the construction of a dividing wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported RIA Novosti at the press office of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) on Friday.
Police repeatedly dispersed protest demonstrations.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs Muammer Guler initially denied the construction, then announced that the wall is being constructed to provide border security.
"The mayor of Nusaybin, Aishe Gokhan, a member of the BDP, went on a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against construction of the wall into a deadly fight," they announced in the party's press office.
The mayor of the city believes that construction of the wall was designed to isolate the Kurdish people of the two countries from one another, Kurds have been crossing the border freely for half a century.
Representatives of the party quote Aishe Gokhan: "This is an inhumane situation with which the Kurds will never consent".
According to the press office, a protest against construction of the dividing wall is planned for November 7 in Nusaybin.
