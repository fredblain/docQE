Presently Roman Senchin is in Paris at a presentation of his novel "Yeltishevi", translated into French.
Let us recall that precisely this novel of his became a finalist for four awards: "Clear glade", "Russian Booker", "National bestseller" and "Big book".
And last year for this book the author was conferred awards from the government of the Russian Federation relating to culture.
Roman Senchin is an undoubted leader in the generation of present-day thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prose writers.
Virtually every publication of his harsh stories and tales based on modern life material incites heated debates among critics from the most diverse areas.
It is fair to say that, combined together, the articles on prose and political essays of Senchin, reviews of his books and journal publications create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990's to the beginning of the 2010's.
In discussions on the works "of one of the most controversial modern writers", according to the critic Sergei Chuprinin, the dialog for the most part is guided by how participants understand the word "literature", how they view the present and future not only of our literature, but also of our life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow its inclusion of the majority of articles and reviews from the regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are provided generally abridged in the sections "Paragraphs..."
