The head trainer of "Colorado" Patrick Roy, explaining the decision to unleash goalkeeper Semyon Varlamov in the first minutes in the final match with "Dallas", expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars has not shaken his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas staff reporter from "Sport Express" Natalia Shmeleva.
But what should we expect, said Roy after the morning skate of the "Avalanches".
Of course, what happened worries us all, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be good for him to get out on the ice today.
We want him to get out on the ice and demonstrate his usual level.
In other words, you are completely confident that the situation in no way has affected the performance of the goalkeeper?
Well today we will see.
Without a doubt our players will support Varly in that they will help him protect the goal, as was the case in the previous matches of this season.
Above all, no one on the team intends to draw any kind of conclusions until the court investigates the situation.
