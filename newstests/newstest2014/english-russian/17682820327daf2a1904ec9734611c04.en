In the U.S. a school principal shot at teenagers.
Teenagers literally drove a principal of one American high school to desperation.
The man, according to him, was compelled to take up a weapon and begin to shoot.
The incident occurred in the state of Tennessee.
As the New York Post writes, the juvenile hooligans rolled the man's house with toilet paper.
Because of this, the school principal opened fire on the teenagers, as a result of which a 15-year-old boy received several wounds in the leg and arm.
Since the hooligans were not on the territory of the principal's property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released on bail of $125 thousand.
Let us note that the shooting of civilians in the U.S. is becoming a frightening regularity.
Literally the day before a man opened fire directly at passersby on the street in the center of the city of Ridgecrest in the American state of California.
Afterwards, the criminal took two random passersby hostage, hid them in the trunk of a car and attempted to escape.
Previously in an elementary school of the city of Newtown, state of Connecticut, a shooting occurred.
The mother of Adam worked in the school, she was a teacher.
