Germany as the first in Europe will establish "undetermined sex" when registering children
Germany will become the first country in Europe where it will be allowed to indicate "undetermined" instead of male or female sex when registering children born as hermaphrodites.
The child's parents will have the right to temporarily leave the "sex" box unfilled on the birth certificate.
Instead of "F" (female sex) or "M" (male sex) parents can temporarily write in "X" (undetermined).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents toward haste with an operation to "clarify" the sex.
According to statistics, one out of 2 thousand newborns in the world is born a hermaphrodite.
