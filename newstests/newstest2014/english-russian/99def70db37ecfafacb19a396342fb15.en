Vitaliy Mutko: Water cannons?
It seems to me that we are back about 15 years in the past.
Minister of sports Vitaliy Mutko voiced his opinion on the disturbances in the stands during the Russian Cup match "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I advocate that clubs, leagues, RFU as organizers of sporting events be responsible for all that.
But as we can see, they have taken a different position.
They expect that someone from the outside will come and establish order.
This is a very nice position, but not entirely correct.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs must invite their stewards and not let things slide.
We just developed a special government order concerning the rules for behavior at stadiums.
After it is adopted, we will closely examine this problem.
But I will also certainly invite all organizers of the football process.
I've read the interview with Leonid Fedun.
Government, he says, give us a law pronto.
It feels as if fans of "Bavaria" came to Yaroslavl and caused all this.
And we are outside observers.
But it really is terrible to see how they shower the stands from a water cannon.
And this happens in a country that is preparing for the world championships.
"I have the feeling that we have went back 10-15 years," said Mutko.
