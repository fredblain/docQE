Power engineers of Dnepropetrovschina have begun a unique program to save... stork nests
In old times, in order to attract storks to the yard, villagers installed a cart wheel on a high post and a heavy nest held up well on it.
Such special supports have long since not been set up, therefore storks have taken fancy to the poles of electric power transmission lines - interwoven branches are supported by wires, thanks to which a stork home sits securely.
Grandma Anya, near the home of which a stork family has been living for already about twenty years in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrikovsky district, began to notice that the nest sags despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds place new branches on top, but the lower layer has already sunk between the wires, will collapse any minute.
Of course, it's a pity for the family of storks that each year have nested near the inn, they hatched and nursed three-four chicks over the summer, but I'd also rather not be without light.
As soon as the birds flew away to warm territories, Grandma Anya called the Tsarichansky regional power network to which the pole belongs.
And did not even expect that there they would respond so fast.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest still hangs on at all, - recounted the technical director of DFPC "Dneprooblenergo" Sergei Berezovsky.
Corrosion had begun on the wires that ended up essentially inside the nest weighing 150-200 kilograms.
At any moment the birds could have died from electric discharge.
And indeed the local residents risked being left without light due to the damage of the wires.
For that reason the linemen began an operation to save the nest, and this is already not the first time in our practical experience.
We were helped by scientist-ornithologists from Dnepropetrovsk National University who developed a scheme for moving the nest.
They even conducted training for employees of regional networks.
The well-known Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised the power specialists at all stages of nest reconstruction.
For a start, they figured that in the region more than 50 stork "apartments" are in an unsafe condition.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded.
They braided the frame with willow branches, and then moved the old nest to it.
According to experts, it is sufficient to lay the old branches as a base so that the birds recognize the nest and return to it.
Later the storks will finish constructing their home themselves.
A month ago in the village of Peschanka in the Novomoskovsky district the first nest was reconstructed.
Next to the power support they placed a new reinforced concrete post and arranged on it a platform with the old, already lived-in nest.
The entire operation cost the power engineers nine thousand hryvnia.
And the other day the same kind of housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrikovsky district at the inn of Grandma Anya.
Here they secured the platform in its previous place, only they slightly raised it above the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that the cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" underwent capital repairs.
Before the end of the year the same reconstruction awaits another four nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of Dnepropetrovschina.
By the way, while some are saving rare birds, others are mercilessly killing them.
The other day sad news spread over the region - in the village of Ust-Kamenka in the Apostolovsky district, on the opening day of pheasant hunting, poachers just for the fun of it gunned down a family of swans dwelling at a local pond.
The noble birds did not fear people at all - local residents fed them and did not offend.
When the villagers, hearing gunshots, ran up to the pond, four beautiful swans already laid dead on the water.
Presently employees of the Apostolovsky district police department are ascertaining who shot the birds listed in the Red Data Book.
