Blizzard released a 19-year-old platformer free of charge
The studio Blizzard released its 1994 platformer Blackthorne for PC free of charge.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to its data, the game became available on Battle.net in the classic games section of Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that presently only those users whose accounts are linked to the American portion of the service can download it.
The game is also still inaccessible for Russian users.
As the media reports, the version that Blizzard just released for PC by appearance does not differ from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The platformer Blackthorne, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, initially came out for SNES consoles.
Its events were set on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day the dark ruler Sarlac decided to kill the light king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle who was saved from death by being sent to Earth.
Twenty years later he returned to Tuul in order to battle against the henchmen of Sarlac and protect the planet's inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game that the studio released after its renaming to Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that it was called Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher of Blackthorne was the company Interplay.
