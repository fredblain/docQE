There is no "Brotherly Circle" group In Ministry of Internal Affairs databases to which the U.S. linked Leps
The "Brotherly Circle" group, to which Washington has linked the singer Grigory Leps, does not appear in the databases of Russian security agencies.
As pointed out to Interfax in law enforcement agencies of the RF, after reports of Grigory Leps being entered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury into blacklists on suspicion of involvement with the Eurasian crime syndicate "Brotherly Circle" emerged in the media, all databases were checked, but such a group was not found.
Security Agencies believe that distribution of such information helps maintain the myth about the so-called "Russian mafia", which supposedly operates abroad.
"Even in the name itself - 'Brotherly Circle', there is a certain element of mystery, containing a hint of a secret lodge.
"All this is very similar to a PR stunt," said an agency source.
On October 31, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the entry of Artur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Ribalskiy and Igor Shlikov into its blacklists on suspicion of involvement with the Eurasian crime syndicate "Brotherly Circle".
The persons entered into this list are suspected of links to a certain Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and are on U.S. sanctions lists since February of 2012.
According to American authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier for delivering money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev".
At Grigory Leps' production center, they declined to comment on the U.S. accusations leveled at the singer, calling it "nonsense".
In 2011, president of the United States Barack Obama added the syndicate "Brotherly Circle" to the list of "significant transnational organized criminal groups" and ordered the Department of the Treasury to "disrupt and inhibit their global criminal operations".
A person's entry into blacklists of the American Department of the Treasury entails blocking his assets in the U.S. and banning business contacts with him by persons living in the United States.
