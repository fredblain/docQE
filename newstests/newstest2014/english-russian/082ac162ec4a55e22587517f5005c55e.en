Runner on the field during the "Shinnik" match
Certain details have become known about the identity of the fan who ran onto the field during the Russian Cup 1/16 final match between Yaroslavl's "Shinnik" and Moscow's "Spartak".
As the head of CDC RFU Artur Grigoryants stated  referring to data from the Interior Ministry, the fan is a Muscovite.
He is currently detained.
"In addition, Grigoryants told of how the fan managed to burst onto the field: "It emerged that this, let's call him spectator, got through to an ambulance in the accompaniment of two spectators citing heart problems.
He approached the ambulance - the ambulance doctor confirmed this to us.
And then he pushed away the two companions and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the Eastern and Southern stands to the corner of the Eastern and Northern stands.
He ran across the entire field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Before the law on sports goes into effect, this is the zone of operations of stewards - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the stands, climbed over the Eastern stands.
And at that time disruptions began in the Eastern stands and on the running lanes," stated the head of the CDC.
Let us recall that by decision of the CDC Moscow's "Spartak" will play the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championships against "Lokomotiv" and "Zenit" without spectators, and will pay a fine in the amount of 600 thousand rubles.
