Snowden is expressing willingness to touch base with German authorities with regard to wiretaps
The former CIA employee Edward Snowden expresses willingness to go to Germany as soon as a legal possibility arises for him to do that, and to meet with representatives of German authorities, reports RIA Novosti.
A letter from the former CIA employee to German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Stroebele, through whom Snowden forwarded a message to German authorities.
Stroebele met with Snowden in Moscow the day before.
