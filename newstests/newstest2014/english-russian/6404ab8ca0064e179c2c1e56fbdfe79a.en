The influence of prison wardens will rise in the new structures of public supervisory committees
Today, the council of the Public Chamber (PC) could confirm the new structures of public supervisory committees (PSC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the version put to vote will be adopted, lobbyists of security agencies will increase their influence.
PSC are public structures that monitor the incarceration conditions in places of detention.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhaev, riots at the Kopeisk penal colony - the majority of resonant events behind bars receive publicity particularly through the PSC.
There is a battle between human rights activists and lobbyists of security agencies for control over PSC.
At the meeting of the PC workgroup on forming PSC, I proposed that experience with human rights activity be set as a criterion.
"They did not accept it, and they generated lists without elaborating criteria," tells Valeriy Borschev.
Borschev is the current chairman of the Moscow Supervisory Committee and Association of Independent Observers - the All-Russian organization of human rights activists engaged in prison issues.
While deputy of the State Duma from "Apple", he developed a law regulating the activity of PSC.
The PC council must vote for the structures of PSC in 43 regions of the country.
Less than a thousand hopefuls seek the 1800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria they could not organize competitions due to lack of candidates.
The PC promises to organize additional recruitment for the vacant seats.
The Moscow PC is one of a few committees with a competition, despite the fact that instead of 20 there will be 40 participants in the new structure.
According to Borschev, in the current structure of the capital's committee are 11 human rights activists and 9 security officials, and in the version that is up for vote in the PC, the ratio is changing to 17 to 23.
Moreover, 30 human rights activists wanted to get on the capital's committee.
On the other hand, representative of "Brothers in Arms" Vyacheslav Kalinin can once again enter the new structure.
He was a member of the PSC for three years, but did not once visit prisoners.
Borschev believes that security agencies, by appointing their PSC representative, will be able to make the work of human rights activists unbearable, therefore human rights activists do not rule out a collective withdrawal from the committee.
In their opinion, the advancement of security agencies is coordinated by PSC member Anton Tsvetkov who heads "Officers of Russia" - an organization advocating the interests of security agencies.
"I don't eat babies for breakfast," declared Anton Tsvetkov to RBC daily.
He denies that he lobbies for the advancement of any kind of lists and says that he does not intend to hinder human rights activists from visiting arrested opposition members.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in which list they are voting on now in the PC.
He considers the information publicized by Borschev as a form of pressure.
A possible success of human rights activists is the planned replacement of the leadership of the Chelyabinsk PSC.
Its former leaders will be dismissed due to last year's Kopeisk riots.
In the Public Chamber they came to the conclusion that the leadership of the local committee ignored the problems of inmates.
However, the Rostov-on-Don PSC could shift from human rights activists to security agencies.
The human rights activist-chairman of the local committee "vanished" from the new lists, yet one of his opponents turned up despite the fact that in May of 2013 the federal Public Chamber expelled him for unethical behavior.
Borschev considers the lists of the Moscow and Rostov committees "revenge for Kopeisk".
The denunciation of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not influence the Mordovia PSC, which they consider to be "security": only one human rights activist wanted to make it into the new structure, and they did not even accept her documents for the competition.
PC council member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC Daily that he voted against the proposed list because the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don troubles him.
He circulated his opinion to other members of the council.
His PC colleague Pavel Gusev says that he voted in favor because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
Deputy secretary of the PC Vladislav Grib, who is also a member of the Scientific Research Institute for the Federal Corrections Service, coordinated the compilation of the lists of the PSC.
Grib told RBC Daily that he does not consider it right to divide candidates into human rights activists and security agencies and does not agree that chairmen of the committees have sufficient authorities to hinder the work of its members.
Grib declines to forecast the voting results of the PC council.
If the proposed list today will be rejected, in coming days an amended version will be brought up for a vote.
