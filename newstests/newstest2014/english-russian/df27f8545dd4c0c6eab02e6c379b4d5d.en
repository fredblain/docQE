The head trainer of "Milan" Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret regarding the draw in the 10th round match of the Italy Championships against "Lazio".
The expert also noted that failures at the start were caused by a series of injuries of leading players.
I am really sorry that we were not able to win, Tmw quotes Allegri.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half we did not allow "Lazio" anything.
In the second the Romans gained, but on the whole I cannot say that we lost concentration.
We needed to win.
Last season we met the objective to make it to the Champions League.
Now we are behind schedule, but this was caused by an entire series of injures of key footballers.
Rami and Honda?
Those are very good players, with character.
However, our roster is also good now.
Look at Kaka, who played the meet at a high level.
