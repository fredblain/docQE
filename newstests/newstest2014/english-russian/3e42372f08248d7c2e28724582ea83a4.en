U.S. intelligence agencies wiretap the personal telephone of the Pope of Rome
The activity of the Vatican is under the vigilant surveillance of American intelligence agencies.
New documents from the collection of Edward Snowden show evidence that U.S. intelligence conducted wiretapping of all conversations of the former Pope Benedict, and now closely watches Pope Francis.
His telephone began to be wiretapped even before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of electing the new Pope was also under surveillance.
To which they assigned special emphasis in the U.S.
An intelligence agency tapped into the cell phones of cardinals who gathered in Rome to select the next Pope.
Telephones of the residence where participants of the conclave lived were also wiretapped.
American spies wiretapped all main contenders for the papacy in order to prevent a figure undesirable to Washington from emerging on it.
The journal "Panorama" writes that the "big ear of the U.S." continued to intercept conversations of prelates until the very completion of the conclave on March 12.
It is asserted that in 2005 Argentine archbishop Bergolio was singled out as the future Pope of Rome.
American intelligence also tracked negotiations associated with the elections of the new president of Vatican Bank.
An Italian journal writes that in the U.S. embassy in Rome a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to work, obtaining information on politicians and financial streams.
In its turn, the Vatican conciliatively announced that American "wiretapping" does not worry it even if it does occur.
The holy fathers hold no secrets from U.S. leadership.
