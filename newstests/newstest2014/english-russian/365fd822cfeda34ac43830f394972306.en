The goalkeeper of "Chicago" Nikolai Khabibulin emphasized: he understands that he must play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard at practices.
At the last two meetings of the "Hawks" Khabibulin initially let through six pucks from "Tampa Bay", and then four from "Ottawa", though in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play good, and in the last two games I was not able to do that, - CSN Chicago quotes Khabibulin.
- I need to find confidence at practices, probably it's worth approaching them like games, and try to achieve the best result.
You have to study your past games and work on those flaws that were present.
There are several small components that I need to improve, but at practices I feel pretty good.
But for some reason after several goals everything turns into a kind of snowball.
Possibly I need to relax a little.
Goalkeepers - I don't think that I am the only one - always strive to play a perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I am not delighted.
It does not matter what happens in front of my goalposts.
I still work on myself in order to not miss so many pucks.
It is great that my teammates are supporting, but essentially everything is simple: I have to play better.
Two games - it is not the entire season, but I wanted to play them much better.
But what happened did happen.
I have to put that aside.
I will simply try to play the next match better.
