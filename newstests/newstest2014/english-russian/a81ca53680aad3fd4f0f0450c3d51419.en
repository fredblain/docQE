The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to host 22 thousand spectators, remarked members of police who attended the meeting of the Control and Disciplinary Committee of the Russian Football Union.
The ticket program was overrated, in their opinion, approximately twofold.
During the Russian Cup 1/16 final match against "Spartak", only a thousand stewards were deployed while the regulatory norm is nine thousand.
Spartak fans were allocated 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of stadium capacity, however, based on an agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets.
The head of the Control and Disciplinary Committee Artur Grigoryants publicized this data.
