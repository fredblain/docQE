The trainer of "Avantgarde" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the regular KHL championship match against "Salavat", noted that Omsk members conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat against Magnitogorsk "Metallurg".
The expert emphasized that "Avantgarde" needs to put more focus on the defensive game.
We watched video of the match against Magnitogorsk "Metallurg", the official site of "Avantgarde" quotes Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of pucks, not a very pleasant time.
We missed due to our mistakes, due to non-execution of the game plan.
We knew that the competitor has performers.
According to statistics they had five attacks straight-off - they drove in three pucks on us.
Very good implementation.
Those mistakes were taken into account when preparing for today's game?
Me and the guys thoroughly analyze each match, talk after the game, prepare for the next competitor.
Above all - so that the plan is executed.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against "Metallurg".
The game plan was being executed, and the score was 2:0.
They missed the goal "into the locker room" - and in the third period began to make mistakes.
Considering how difficult the game took shape, I did not see any sense in activating defenders.
The entire team needs to defend itself.
Now "Avantgarde" has a long home series, matches take place every other day - has the team accumulated fatigue?
All teams are under identical conditions.
The main thing now is actualizing your moments and executing the game plan.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you execute the plan - everything is solved not so difficult.
