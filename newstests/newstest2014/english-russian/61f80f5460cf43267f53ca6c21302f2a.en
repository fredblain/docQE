Thorium - the new hope of nuclear power?
Governments in countries of the entire world continue to think about how to supply energy needs.
Combustion of hydrocarbons (there where they are) negatively affects climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear power manages without both of them, but leaves behind itself a mass of wastes expensive to recycle.
Recently scientists directed attention to thorium - one more radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found throughout the world, and, as specialists confirm, its fission does not leave wastes that need to be stored for centuries.
