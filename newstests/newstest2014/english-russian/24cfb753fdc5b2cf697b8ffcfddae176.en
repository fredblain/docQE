After being accused of bad taste Evgenia Vasilyeva began to talk
Evgenia Vasilyeva, whose persona has riveted the close attention of the media for almost a year, until now has not once commented on the multiple publications in the press about embezzlement in the Ministry of Defense as well as about her personally - relations with former defense minister Anatoliy Serdyukov, her poetry and passion for valuable things.
However, on November 1 the figurante in the "Defense service" affair broke her silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasilyeva stated: "From the beginning, of course, there was exactly one objective: pry from me any negative information in relation to the former defense minister."
There was blackmail in respect to the fact that I have to give testimony, otherwise they will send me to prison.
Presently those threats have ceased.
Next we are going to court, we will prove our innocence.
We are 100 percent sure of victory.
Moreover, from the interview one can conclude that, perhaps, Vasilyeva was most offended by words to the effect that she has poor taste.
This is probably in reference to the statement of the official representative of the RF Investigative Committee Vladimir Markin that fakes were detected in the collection of paintings collected by the figurante in the "Defense service" affair.
Among the arrested property are a number of paintings that the proprietress, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, a fine art appraisal appointed by investigators after the arrest of the paintings established that they have no artistic value and, to put it plainly, are cheap fakes," noted Markin in the beginning of October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
Then they nevertheless admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, and also said that I have poor taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss certain personal aspects?
In my opinion, this is simply an outrage," Vasilyeva says.
Moreover, in response to the question, does she admit her guilt in even one of the 12 criminal counts imputed to her, Vasilyeva stated: "Of course not.
There is really nothing to admit.
Furthermore, the damage to the Russian Federation at issue does not exist.
They are simply deceiving the people, end of story.
In addition, in response to today's announcement by the RF Investigative Committee that Vasilyeva is evading familiarization with materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the figurante declared that the "investigator is not letting him and his client familiarize themselves with the materials of the case."
What was the reason for the revelations by Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest and until now had not communicated with the press?
Is it possible that as a woman she couldn't not answer the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the "Komsomolka" journalists right, asserting a couple of days ago that she "fell into an even deeper trance under house arrest" due to the news of the reconciliation between Anatoliy Serdyukov and his wife and his return to the family bosom?
The well-known military columnist of "KP" Victor Baranets in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "Investigators do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more talkative during questioning."
Previously Vasilyeva assumed responsibility for several accusations of unlawful sale of real estate property of the Ministry of Defense.
