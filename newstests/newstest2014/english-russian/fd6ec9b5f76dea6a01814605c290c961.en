They may interrogate Snowden in Russia
Former employee of American intelligence agencies Edward Snowden most likely will not leave Russia to provide testimony on the matters regarding the wiretapping of telephone conversations of the chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel.
As a source familiar with the situation stated to Interfax, the American can respond to the questions of representatives of the German Prosecutor's Office in writing or face-to-face in Russia.
The departure of Edward Snowden beyond Russia is virtually excluded.
"In such a case he would lose the status of a refugee and may be turned over to Washington by allied countries of the U.S.," said an agency source.
"Instead, basically the Prosecutor's Office of Germany could send its representatives to the RF or submit written questions to Snowden," added the source, adding that this issue must be handled at an international level.
Previously, deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Stroebele reported that Edward Snowden is ready to provide testimony on the matter regarding the wiretapping of conversations of the chancellor of Germany by American intelligence agencies.
Snowden is ready to provide testimony to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or on the territory of Germany.
The former employee of the CIA indicated that he knows quite a lot.
Despite the fact that the U.S. NSA has obstructed all of his movements, Snowden is willing to come to Germany.
However, for that it is necessary to clearly define all conditions of his arrival," reported Stroebele to the television channel Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoliy Kucherena, commenting on the statement by the Interfax source, announced that his client may collaborate with German investigators, but when and how - he will decide himself.
The U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who had worked in the National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May of 2013, after which he disclosed information on secret operations of U.S. intelligence agencies regarding internet surveillance.
Snowden was flying transit through Moscow, but could not leave the airport because U.S. authorities revoked his passport, in absentia claiming serious accusations against him, and until the beginning of August he has remained in the transit area of Sheremetyevo airport.
On the first of August Snowden received a document conferring him temporary refuge on the territory of Russia for a period of one year and on that same day he left Sheremetyevo.
Yesterday the American's lawyer Anatoliy Kucherena announced that his client got a job at a "major Russian company".
German media reported on the NSA wiretapping of Angela Merkel last week.
According to journalists, the Americans began to wiretap the chancellor's telephone conversations in 2002.
The surveillance station allegedly was located in the U.S. embassy in Berlin.
After publication of these data German authorities announced that surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
