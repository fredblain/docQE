Nagold: Hugo Wermter - a choir member for 60 years
Having been a singer for 60 years, Hubert Wermter's story with the Cäcilia Male Choral Society is almost twice as long as that of the Autumn Festival, during which he was ceremonially honoured.
As per usual, Hubert Wermter stood on the stage in the colours of his male voice choir.
Even after 60 years he still finds great pleasure from singing with the choir, which has achieved much more than popularity during this period.
Wermter has also been active within the association, serving as a member of the committee for 28 years, among other roles.
For his commitment and loyalty to the organisation, he has also received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Lay Pastor acting on behalf of the Cäcilian Association of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him with an Association Certificate and a letter of commendation signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst - the choir also serves as a church choir.
His choir colleagues presented him with a German Choral Association certificate and an engraved pewter plate.
Aside from honouring Hugo, the 31st Autumn Festival progressed as usual: Alongside the Betra Male Voice Choir, the Salzstetten Choral Club, the Baisingen Choral Division and the Local Music Society, the Vollmaringen singers delivered a colourful blend of different choral and song styles, which entertained the 400 or so visitors.
The Vollmaringen Male Voice Choir got things running with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
They had also prepared a short serenade as a tribute to their honorary singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The Betra Male Voice Choir also sang classic choral pieces such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann du durchgehst durchs Tal".
With its mixed choir and its ladies' ensemble - the "Impulschor" (Impulse Choir), the Salzstetten Choral Club ensured that the female quota was fulfilled at the festival.
The mixed choir carried listeners away to foreign lands with the Neapolitan folksongs "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, while the "Impulschor" also drew on foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were included on their programme.
The Choral Division of the Baisingen Sports Club returned to its home ground with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", while the Vollmaringen Music Society provided the crowning musical conclusion.
For children, there was a small auxiliary programme - "Oma Hanne" (Grandma Hanne), a.k.a Hannelore Stollsteimer, performed a 'Kasperl' theater (similar to Punch and Judy) and read some stories, which kept the children entertained throughout the afternoon.
