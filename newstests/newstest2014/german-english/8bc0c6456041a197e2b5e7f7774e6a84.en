Germany's largest national church has launched a campaign advertising the minister's position.
This comes at the same time as a possible shortage of ministers: The Protestant Lutheran Regional Church of Hanover calculates that, as things stand, the current number of around 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030.
For the young people of today, the career is very attractive and offers good future prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in a conversation with the Protestant Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine your own daily working routine.
With Burfien, the regional church has for first time commissioned a minister to work full time, endeavouring to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people are deciding to study theology after their Abitur examinations (equivalent to A levels).
Burfien puts this down to the process of secularisation: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The job is characterised by great freedom and variety.
I am the master of my own schedule and can therefore turn my focus to what is important to me.
As pastoral workers, ministers can be close to people.
They earn as much as teachers and can make a good living.
Of course wages are higher within the private sector, but on the other hand, theologians have a secure employer.
This would suit the young people of today, as it is not just about your career, but about having a meaningful job as well.
According to information from the Regional Church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors retire every year.
At the same time, around 40 theology graduates begin as vicars.
In future it may be difficult to fill positions in sparsely populated outlying areas such as Harz, Emsland or Wendland.
Among other initiatives, Burfien wants to organise study days for young people, inviting famous faces who have studied theology.
Theology courses offer broad training.
You can even become Federal President with a theology degree.
