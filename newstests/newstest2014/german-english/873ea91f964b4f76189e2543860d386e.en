What happens with my e-mail when in transit?
E-mail is short for electronic mail.
Are there technical measures to maintain privacy of correspondence, similar to that of the traditional postal service, implemented into the design of this Internet-based service?
When designing the early Internet services, the focus lay on making communication possible.
Thus, when developing the underlying technical protocols, no attention was given to creating a stable foundation for the interception-proof exchange of mail.
For this reason, a traditional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
When user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the pair's computers then directly connected?
Anna's email program or browser first sends the mail to her service provider's mail server.
If she has a Gmail account, for example, this would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
En route, the mail can pass through any number of other servers on the Internet.
Benni can then call up the content from his provider.
Are traditional e-mails read by third parties on their journey through the net?
The majority of e-mails are read several times by software robots en route to the recipient.
Checks are generally carried out by the sender's provider as to whether the mail contains malware as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is nuisance or unwanted spam mail, which are deleted immediately or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have other tasks?
In the case of systems such as Gmail, the robots also identify the information that Google requires for displaying context-based advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate about their upcoming holiday travels via Gmail, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown individuals also read the e-mails?
The probability of unauthorised persons reading a mail is extremely low.
However, theoretically, it is possible.
Within companies, administrators are often able to read electronic mail that is sent.
Law enforcement authorities and Secret Services also have legal authorisation to intercept or take note of e-mails.
This may include potential illegal spying activities.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against being read?
With an encryption using the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively protected against being read.
With great technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of email communication so that it is not even possible to tell who is communicating with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google within the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a study conducted by Convios Consulting in August 2013, among the main mail services in private use, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role.
While the number of Yahoo Mail accounts has fallen recently, Google's Gmail managed to grow considerably.
