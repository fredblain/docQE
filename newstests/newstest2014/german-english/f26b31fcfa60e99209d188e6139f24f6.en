The USA still want to prosecute Snowden
The USA have not changed their position regarding the former US Secret Service employee Edward Snowden.
He is still accused of passing on secret information without authorisation.
He must therefore face criminal proceedings in the USA, said the spokesperson for the US Foreign Office, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Even the most recent statements from Snowden will not change this fact.
Following a recent meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the USA not to continue to threaten him with prosecution.
Psaki emphasised that Ströbele's comments were the views of a parliamentarian, and not those of a German government member.
