NSA siphons data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Secret Service whistleblower, Edward Snowden, has a fundamental interest in helping Germany clarify the increasingly explosive NSA espionage scandal.
According to Green Party MP. Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia addressed the conditions under which the former Secret Service employee would make a statement to a German District Attorney or before an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complex legal situation, Ströbele said on ARD's "Panorama" programme.
