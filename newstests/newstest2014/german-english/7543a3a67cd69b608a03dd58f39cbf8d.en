Thus far, the Kempten Police Department can look back on a calm Halloween night.
The authorities were only called out twice to deal with children throwing eggs against houses.
Because the home owners realised this immediately, the egg remnants could be cleaned off at once, meaning that no material damage occurred.
Furthermore, in the town centre area, while a few fireworks were set off, no material damage was caused here either.
The residents of the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that a car was wrapped in toilet paper and its wheel trims stolen.
However, the man found all his wheel trims nearby prior to the police arriving, on account of which no further police involvement was required.
