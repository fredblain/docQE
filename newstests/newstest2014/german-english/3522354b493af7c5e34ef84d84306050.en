A kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," said Winterlingen's Mayor Michael Maier.
The local authorities have sold the former Kindergarten on Gartenstra√üe to a private buyer.
The Town Council consented to the sale in its most recent meeting, during the part of the meeting that was not open to the public.
The building changed hands for an "appropriate" price.
"The local authorities are satisfied," emphasised Maier.
EUR 100,000 have been added to the local budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former Kindergarten.
The Mayor considers it the right decision that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter, and thus will no longer have to pay for the upkeep of the building, such as heating it, tending to the garden and clearing the pavement.
"This expense has now been offloaded," Maier was glad to say.
