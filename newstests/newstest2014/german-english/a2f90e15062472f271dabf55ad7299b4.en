Bavaria's basketball players optimistic in spite of first defeat.
Even their first defeat in the Euroleague could not curtail the huge optimism of the FC Bayern M체nchen Basketballers.
"No-one can stop us believing that we can win, even against the best team in Europe over the last two years," assessed Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic following the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) defeat to title defenders Olympiakos Pir채us on Thursday evening.
We have delivered a message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their first three appearances in the European top flight, the Munich team put in a good performance for long periods, but in the crucial phases were not sufficiently focussed.
Initially the guests managed to turn a 15-point deficit into a lead, with 13 minutes to go, before Pir채us was able to turn the game around once again.
"We fought back incredibly well against the two-time Euroleague champions, but then once again made careless mistakes.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful strikers for the Munich team, who had celebrated clear wins against the Italian Series champions Montepaschi Siena, and the Polish title-holders, Zielona G처ra, in their first two games.
