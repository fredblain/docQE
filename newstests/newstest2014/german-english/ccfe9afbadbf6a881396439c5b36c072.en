The throwaway society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the atmosphere good, but at some point everyone has to go home.
Except: In the stomachs of those in the passenger and back seats, hunger strikes.
Of course, this may be down to the odd cocktail or glass of bubbly!
So what could be more natural than to casually pull into the next drive-through to pick yourself up a little treat?
I admit, I am right with you with it comes to picking up some fast food late at night, or early in the morning as the case may be.
A few chips, a coke, a burger - and then straight home and into bed!
However, on the way home the clear differences between me and other hungry clubbers become evident.
What is wrong with people who continually throw their fast food bags out of the car window?!
At the weekend in particular, discarded paper bags can be found at the side of the road and in car parks.
"Why is this?" I ask myself.
Are the people too stupid to take their bags home or throw them into the nearest rubbish bin?
After all, waste paper does more than spoil the landscape.
Bags have also been seen covering transport facilities such as crash barriers, thus causing accidents.
However, the so-called "throwaway society" does not think about such things. They probably do not even know what the term even means.
If you are often out and about in the evening, more often than not with several people in the car, you will know what a back seat can look like after having partied through the night: clothes, bottles and other rubbish begin to pile up.
A few bags won't make much of a difference there - in contrast to on the street where no-one wants to trample through other peoples' leftover food.
I can see the day coming when towns and municipalities will get fed up clearing up - and the fast food chains will have to operate a deposit scheme for their bags.
