Rangnick scolding for refs: Mane is no diver
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the present winning form of the Austrian Bundesliga table-toppers, Red Bull Salzburg, the Sporting Director of the "Bulls" expressed equal disappointment with the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous trend, with Mane and Alan being dubbed as 'divers'," he said at a press conference in Salburg on Thursday, in defence of the two tricky offensive players.
The most recent cause for Rangnick's criticism was the yellow card for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, whereby the Senegalese striker was penalised for supposed play acting - admittedly this was not justified, as shown by TV footage.
"A blatant wrong decision," commented Rangnick, who referred to Harkam as being "completely out of his depth".
Harkam also played "his part" in the escalation between Salzburg Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
He firmly defended his German compatriot: "In each individual situation I would have behaved in the same way as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself did not wish to have any contact with his colleagues after the skirmish with Hütter.
I do not know why.
"After all, I was the one who was insulted," emphasised the 46-year-old.
However, with regard to the winning run, Rangnick sang his team's praises.
"There are only two words for it: Really good," he stated.
There is not a lot you can criticise.
Most of all, the manner in which the team is playing is impressive.
We must stay composed and keep it up.
There will hardly be any squad changes in the winter transfer window.
There is no major reason to change anything.
"Unless a player comes forward and expresses the desire to leave the club," explained Rangnick.
