Mastering the struggle to perfection.
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is perfectly suited to Horst Janson.
Janson is an old hand himself when it comes to his profession, the art of acting.
The old man, Santiago, is the best there is when it comes to fishing.
As such, the pair complement one another superbly.
You almost think that you can see the folds in the old man's neck, of which young fisherman Manolo speaks.
When Santiago sits arched over on the chair, tired of life, this is a genuine emotion for Janson.
Furthermore, the role of the old fisherman is a character role, through and through, which Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who doesn't give up and who ultimately wins the battle against the fish as a result of his knowledge and his strong will.
For long periods, Janson is the only performer on the stage.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, with the result that his monologues never become boring, not even for just a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that members of the audience forget that the sea in question consists merely of water bottles, illuminated in blue.
Director Jens Hasselmann has the old man in the boat perform in front of Fischerdorf.
During the course of the performance he has the respective active scene illuminated. Santiago's cabin and the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings of the Cuban lifestyle, with your songs and beautiful voice.
The four musicians accompany with Cuban rhythms and guests at the bar at the same time.
