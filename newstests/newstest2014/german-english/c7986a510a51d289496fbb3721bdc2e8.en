Hechingen: Trade fair provides the answers to wedding questions
"Marriage is and remains the most important journey of discovery a person can undertake," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, at least as to how the wedding celebration can be a success, have now been given at a special trade fair in the Domäne in Hechingen.
Important suppliers of all wedding-related products and services were represented.
A trend: The retro look is back once again.
This begins with the wedding clothing.
White is a must, best muted or in cream.
At the front, dresses with numerous ruffles and embroidery are in, often with a veil, while to the rear they run down the back and often end in a train.
However, opinions differ, as Stefanie Koch from the Modehaus Kleidermüller emphasised.
For men, suits with a waistcoat and neckerchief are most popular, although some people do choose cream or brown combinations.
Selecting the venue is important, it was explained.
Plain adjoining rooms are not ideal, the ambience should be special.
In this regard, the Domäne drew attention to their own facilities in the carriage house.
Uwe Link has an offer for anyone who wants to set off in a carriage.
"However, carriages are also popular for hen parties," he commented.
People were also on the lookout for romantic ideas for invitations, flower arrangements and wedding photographs.
The "After-Wedding Photo" is becoming increasingly fashionable - that is, series of pictures taken a few days after the celebration, at special locations, preferably in front of waterfalls or the like, but in full wedding clothing, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many other details for a successful wedding were presented in the Domäne on Sunday.
Flower arrangements, rings, wedding tables, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests with style.
The correct cosmetics and nail care mustn't be forgotten.
Everything you need for an unforgettable celebration.
