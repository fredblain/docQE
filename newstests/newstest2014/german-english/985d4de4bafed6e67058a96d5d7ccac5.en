The newly designed Opschlag stands out with a new café.
One that invites you to linger a while and to come again.
One that wants to get its name out there.
According to dictionaries, déjà vu is defined as a psychological phenomenon, which expresses itself in the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the Opschlag in Kleve County, with a view of the Rhein-Waal University, it doesn't always have to remain a pure déjà vu feeling.
Ultimately, this is precisely the aim of the café with the wonderful name: to make an actual visit and something that can be repeated on a recurring basis, not just theoretically, but tangibly.
Because it is fun and simply beautiful.
A glance into the internal workings at Opschlag 8 gives the onlooker a positive feeling right from the outset.
With its ultra-modern yet cosy café ambience, it looks like a place designed to make you feel good.
The team here, with business founders, Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the helm, spoils guests with a wide range of coffees and cocktails.
In addition to this, there are delicious cakes or freshly baked baguettes, filled to order.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs prior to opening the chic café on the Opschlag: They previously managed the "Art Lounge" in Kranenburg.
By moving to Kleve on the Opschlag, the friendly café lovers hope to reach a wider audience.
Not least through university customers.
"We don't have a specific target group," emphasises Daniel Büttner.
In actual fact, here the pair hope to appeal as much to young students as they do to senior citizens and all age brackets.
Speaking of café lovers...
The two friendly owners are motivated by their love of coffee.
They themselves enjoy the fragrant, hot brew in a variet of formats.
Espresso fan
Daniel Büttner is more of an espresso fan, while Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.
"And a baguette with it - that's my thing," she revealed to the NRZ.
There have already been two events held in the brightly lit café.
Or perhaps more accurately, one.
This is because the Hafenfest took place more outside than in - Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
However, there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
The two 33-year-olds found it "beautiful, successful and funny".
But it was not for everyone.
Perhaps this is why Daniel Büttner is not a vocal fan of evening events: "You just cannot please everyone".
And with an event, I am always only appealing to those who have expressed an interest in the special event.
For this reason, events will always be an exception to the rule for us.
"We want to cause as little disruption as possible to normal business".
That is to say: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
This is with regard to the quality of the products that are offered here, as well as the team and the fantastic setting on the Opschlag in Kleve.
The street that is fast becoming a 'restaurant mile'.
This is to the delight of many Kleve residents, guests from near and far and the students who are discovering the 'restaurant mile', and with it the Café Déjà Vu, for themselves.
