Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleiner Heuberg stand together in the confirmation of their profession of faith
In two services, 101 15 and 16-year-olds from the Am Kleinen Heuberg pastoral care unit were confirmed.
In the morning, the service was accompanied by the Laudato-Si Group, while the afternoon service featured 'The Spirit' youth choir.
Upon receiving the confirmation sacrament, the young people accepted their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
Over recent months those being confirmed, under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and the assistance of several church members, have been preparing for the special day.
In various projects, they learned of the different tasks involved in Christian church life and attended the Youth Day in Untermachtal together.
