You could call him the Dostoevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a metaphysician, and to a certain extent his novels and stories also feature recurring themes.
The external likeness is astounding: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And so, as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky - with his massive oeuvre - is considered the revealer and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is considered an American prophet, who is certainly highly esteemed within his own native country.
Some titles have been released by the Heyne Verlag publishing house,the 'Haffman's cassette' featuring 118 stories was distributed by Zweitaudenseins.
Dick illustrates America - the kingdom of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, a fixation on security and the belief of having been chosen.
Dick had 'God experiences', and his later books read like a mixture of the Book of Revelation and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was crazy, or perhaps drugs had affected his brain.
He realised, early on, that computers are divinities.
He wrote a 'Theology of the Computer' and questioned what separates humans from the machine, the creator from the creation.
That is the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film producers such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
The latter story is now particularly significant.
"Minority Report" originates from the year 1956, and exudes the scent of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here the principle of the "Pre-Crime" is developed, i.e. something that is now more or less official doctrine within the White House.
In Dick's world, which is alarmingly similar to our own, mutants look into the future - and the police have access to this insight.
"We arrest individuals who've broken no law," says the government official.
"We get to them first, before they can commit an act of violence".
And: "In our society we have no major crimes, but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals". They read time streams.
They assume that bad things are going to happen and prevent the criminal thought turning into action.
Dick's tale acts as a blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the phone tapping madness of the NSA.
Anticipation of attack: This is also how Obama's drone philosophy and practices work.
However, Dick's story is not yet finished.
The Police Chief argues that there is no more division of power, the military controls daily life - and what is left of the State.
Then the watcher is himself being watched and is convicted of a future crime.
The system slips up.
It is perfect, but it lies.
It devises its own conditions.
It not only accepts errors and victims, but builds itself on them.
The system creates the threat that it is fighting against.
To read Philip K. Dick means to get closer to the truth, time and time again.
