Leg almost hacked off: Rocker retrial
A bloody attack within the 'Rocker' scene is to be re-investigated after more than four years.
Proceedings for attempted murder, grievous bodily harm and material damage, brought against two 30-year-olds have begun before the Frankfurt District Court.
They are being accompanied by strict security precautions.
The accused initially remained silent.
They are said to have been active within the Rocker scene and to have at the time belonged to the Bandidos.
The Public Prosecutor accused them of having stabbed and beaten three men in a car in Finowfurt, together with unknown accomplices.
All the victims were seriously injured, with one man almost losing a leg.
The victims were said to have belonged to the competing gang, the Hell's Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It seems that the attack was preceded by a car chase involving several cars.
According to accusations, this was part of a turf war and represented a demonstration of power.
The two accused were acquitted in an initial trial at the beginning of 2012.
At the time, a speaker for the court said that it could not be proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The assailants had worn masks and had not been recognised.
The Federal Supreme Court repealed the verdict following an appeal by the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred the case back to the District Court for a re-trial.
One of the accused is currently serving time in an open prison on account of another offence.
Proceedings initially mainly involved the reconstruction of the series of events on the night of the crime.
The police inspector responsible at the time was invited as a witness.
The central point of focus was on mobile phone conversations between the accused and third parties, which the police had intercepted.
What makes things difficult is that Rockers almost always observe what they consider to be complete silence appearing before the court - they say absolutely nothing.
This also applies in the case of the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims spoke out.
When asked, Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) Public Prosecutor's Office said that new evidence had come to light since the previous trial.
A further eleven days of proceedings have been scheduled for the trial.
