Hoarding on the Bechtle plot painted
A group belonging to the "Schweizer Wiese" citizen's initiative has given the hoarding on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb a face-lift.
In addition, they have cleaned and widened the footpath, a press release announced.
The planned covering of the dilapidated house to the rear of the plot was not permitted for safety reasons, as the premises were at risk of collapsing.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the site, arranged the 'face-lift' in cooperation with his colleague, Reinhard Domke, from the citizen's initiative.
Before the citizen's initiative project, a banner with the message "We are in favour" was put up.
However, this did little to distract the 20 or so members of the citizen's initiative from their project.
Their motto, on the large billboard stated "We are against unfinished buildings".
In so doing they wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Schweizer Wiese - should the huge project one day fail.
Chatting with many people passing by the "construction site", it became clear that many citizens believe the execution of the project would make things much better for the town, although many have the same questions as the citizen's initiative regarding the scale of the planned project.
However, they are beginning to resign themselves as the town continues to stall in providing answers, said a statement from the citizen's initiative.
We have now been told that the public statements made by the Mayor are also having an impact.
In May, in the meeting of the Town Council, he said that he feared for the outcome of the spa should the population vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Schweizer Wiese in the local referendum.
Some appear utterly frightened by it, others perceive it as a "blatant attempt to blackmail" the population, continued the press release from the citizen's initiative.
The citizen's initiative thanked those who donated paint and all those who lent a hand.
