In protest against the planned tax on the rich, the French Football Association is set to actually go through with the first strike since 1972.
A mediation meeting comes to an end without resolution.
In the conflict regarding the tax on the wealthy, the government and the professional football association in France have manoeuvred into a cul-de-sac following a failed mediation meeting.
President François Hollande welcomed club and association representatives to Paris' Élysée Palace on Thursday, where he listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare the football association from the planned 75% income tax to be imposed on those earning in excess of one million €per year, which every company in the country will have to pay for two years, from 2014.
The opposition also remained adamant.
The strike announced for the end of November will now go ahead, informed the head of the Union of Professional Football Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 match days scheduled between 29 November and 2 December will thus be cancelled.
