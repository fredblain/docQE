Hansjakob back in Freihof once again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his final years in the "Freihof" were brought to life.
The large audience was inspired by the extremely amusing role play.
From his arrival, to his being conferred with honorary citizenship and his death, Alois Kraftzcyk, the scriptwriter and actor portraying Hansjakob, has written an entertaining play, which received great acclaim under the directorship of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann, serving as narrator, guided the audience through the ten different scenes, explained circumstances and provided links explaining leaps from his youth to the time when he was approaching retirement.
On 22 October 1913, Hansjakob returned home to his childhood paradise, to his Freihof.
It was there that the role-play began, with Alois Krafczyk shining once again in his famous role as the town's great son.
True to style, he travelled with a two-horse carriage drawn by "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" (Black Forest Chestnut Horses) owned by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he received with great applause from the audience, but was also welcomed by his sister Philippine.
Billy Sum-Hermann managed unbelievably well to place herself in the role of the sister and brought the character to life amazingly well, in terms of both her expressions and gestures.
Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected musical pieces, thus rounding off the performance.
The honour of presenting the title of honorary citizen went to Haslach's Mayor, Heinz Winkler, who, together with a section of the Town Council, made an appearance representing the Mayor of Hüttich from back in Hansjakob's day.
The "Dreikönig" singers then made their own appearance, leading Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh how beautiful, this brings childhood memories of my own time in a Dreikönig group back to life".
With their song, "O Jesulein", they delighted the audience in the Freihof, as did the "Storchentagskinder" with their loud cries of "Heraus, Heraus" .
In his day, Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the institutional church, as well as his concerns regarding the excesses in the rural economy, the consequences of industrialisation and the effects of the war.
He found his place of rest on his native soil, behind his mausoleum on the Brand  near Hofstetten.
The role-play ended with the words "A restless spirit finally found rest and returned home forever".
The performance received great applause and many words of praise from the audience.
