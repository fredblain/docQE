According to dictionaries, veganism is a sub-category of vegetarianism, yet the two do differ considerably.
For while vegetarians allow themselves to consume cream tarts, ice cream or a strong Edam, these indulgences are off the menu for vegans.
Milk, cheese, egg - alongside avoiding meat and fish, vegans refrain from eating all products of animal origin - even honey is not permitted.
You might ask what is left, however, upon closer inspection the world of vegan nutrition is characterised by great resourcefulness.
"Spreads are very popular," explained Ute Henkelmann the owner of the local health food store, which provides a host of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store on "Domgasse".
The New Zealander has been vegan for 13 years, and in Lampertheim he can find (almost) everything that he needs to get by. "In 1997 I adjusted my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the millennium I took the next step and became vegan.
"However, it wasn't just the diet that convinced me, but also my choice of shoes," said Proctor, who prefers artificial leather over normal leather.
He realised that you can also overcome all other daily concerns without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is a matter of ethics.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me," said Proctor, expressing the maxim of vegans, which applies to all their consumer behaviour.
Rather than missing burgers, scrambled eggs or gummi bears, the vegan has quickly discovered entirely new products that really inspire him.
"It is a double bonus," says Proctor now, "in actual fact being vegan is not about doing without, it's not about asceticism, but rather it is an enhancement". Regarding the assumption that when you convert your diet you are reducing your choice of meal options, Proctor puts this down to force of habit.
And it is precisely this conditioning that results in many a well-intentioned attempt failing.
"The temptation factor is a decisive factor in causing many to quickly give up, similar to with smoking," says Proctor, providing a comparison.
And he argues: "Certain flavours are not linked to animal produce".
Often it is the herbs or the type of preparation that provide the flavour.
"You can, however, create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
For example, when attending a barbecue party, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages.
He ensures a balanced, varied diet, whereby everything should also have a good hearty flavour.
Of course you want to have something with a bit of bite, that is fair enough.
"It should be tasty, but this doesn't necessarily mean animal-based food," said Proctor.
He has not suffered any damage to his health or eating disorders - another wide-spread assumption.
Converting has had a positive effect for me.
I do not consume any foreign cholesterol and have increased my vitamin intake.
There are top athletes who also have an exclusively vegan diet.
"My blood values are excellent - I have myself checked on a regular basis," revealed Proctor.
Many critics of veganism warn in particular of the lack of vitamin B12.
"Because animals are fed on fodder instead of grazing, it is dubious whether the vitamin B12 content in meat sold in freezers is actually high," commented Proctor.
For vegans there is also the option of taking the co-enzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explained.
Proctor does not have to travel far to buy food.
There are basic foodstuffs available everywhere, and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
I can find everything I need locally.
I only purchase special items now and again.
"Many people overlook the fact that even though ready-made vegan products are expensive, it is well-known that this is also the case for "normal" ready-made products.
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than commonly assumed.
"In home cooking, there is much to be discovered - with a few minor tweaks you can achieve good, if not sometimes better results," said Proctor.
Margarine in place of butter, a little more baking powder and bicarbonate of soda in place of egg - Proctor has even managed to astonish his in-laws with his vegan cheese cakes.
The vegan adds new spice to family parties.
When you cook together there is a certain dynamic - cooking takes on new value.
"The situations that may arise are as varied as the people themselves," said Proctor.
Of course he has already met with scepticism.
Do you not like my food any more?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - as a vegan you have to be tactful in such matters.
"I do not disapprove of people, I am part of this society," said Proctor, explaining that he was not choosing a life of isolation.
And on closer observation, the everyday world does not appear quite so 'un-vegan' - and vegans are not quite as limited in their everyday lives as is commonly assumed.
Fast food is also permitted.
Chips are available everywhere!
"Many doner kebab houses offer falafel, or even vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he avoids pasta dishes or just orders a pizza without cheese, all just a question of habit.
Restaurants are slowly adapting to things.
"When I began eating a vegan diet 13 years ago, things were even more difficult," says the New Zealander, and he points out: "You have to talk with people, make them aware".
"If enough requests are made, they will perhaps be inclined to expand their menus," he hopes.
There are vegan restaurants opening up, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor hopes that other restaurants will also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Essentially, vegan dishes are for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, they are the exact opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, as they rule others out," assessed Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to rule out the majority of scandals from the outset," says Proctor.
However, purchasing vegan products can be difficult to start with.
OInce you come to understand that peanuts, in particular, may also contain animal additives as a colourant, people seem to quickly lose courage when following a code of ethics with so many hurdles and pitfalls.
Therefore, for this reason and others, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book. "Veganissimo - Tierische Inhaltsstoffe und ihre Alternativen" (Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives) explains the many ingredients hidden in both foodstuffs and cleaning agents.
"You gradually develop an internal scanner and you know which symbols and logos you have to look out for". Proctor has learned that "it is sometimes better too take small steps rather than to stand still or stumble".
Veganism is an important moral compass, which has an effect on your consciousness.
Perhaps he won't manage to help you break old habits altogether, but at least he manages to teach consumers to critically question their habits.
