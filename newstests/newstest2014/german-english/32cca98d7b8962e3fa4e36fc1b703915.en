Piercing beep disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested highly in land
They stockpile the coal that arrives on ships.
At the same time, the company also has other irons in the fire at the location.
Besides coal imports, Rhenus Midgard is also active in the field of wind park logistics, among other ventures.
The coals shimmer black in the storage yard in front of the embankment.
Here two huge blue stacker and reclaimer machines distribute or load the coals as required.
With each movement of the handling machines, a shrill warning noise rings out over the site.
"The signals are for the purpose of security and are legally prescribed," said Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the event of unfavourable wind, they can be heard from far away - and as a result there have already been a number of complaints from people from the north of the town.
The 40-year-old said that he is taking the complaints very seriously and has therefore been in touch with those affected.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in a position to make the warning signals quieter by means of the implementation of technical measures.
In future he will also seek open dialogue with neighbours.
For Matthias Schrell has some further plans at the location.
With the construction of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard is continuing to focus on coal exports for power stations and is one of the major powers in this sector in Europe.
Thanks to the mooring basin to the front of the terminal, sunken to a depth of 18.5 metres, it has for some time now been possible to unload Capesize bulk carriers here.
"In terms of handling, this year we hope to break the 3 million tonne mark," said Schrell.
Alongside the local Eon power plant, the imported coals also go to power plants inland.
When the GDF-Suez plant is added to the network, around 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year will be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second transport belt could see this rise to 10 million.
