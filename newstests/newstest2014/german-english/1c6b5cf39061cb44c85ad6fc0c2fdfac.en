Mother buried in shallow forest grave and pension stolen
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg devised a plan.
He buried the deceased in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allowance.
According to police investigations, a 67-year-old Wolfsburg resident buried his dead mother in the woods in order that he might continue to collect her pension and care allowance.
He first covered up the death of the 89-year-old and then pocketed the money for more than a year and a half.
The 67-year-old must now face charges of fraud, said a spokesperson on Friday.
According to the statement, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already under suspicion back in May: At that time the fact that medications for his care-reliant mother were no longer required drew suspicion.
The pensioner told investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
The officials found this strange and so continued to investigate.
It was discovered that the mother and son had lived in the same residence for more than 15 years and that he had cared for her in her final days.
The 67-year-old finally acknowledged the death of his mother.
According to police, an autopsy showed no evidence of any capital offence.
