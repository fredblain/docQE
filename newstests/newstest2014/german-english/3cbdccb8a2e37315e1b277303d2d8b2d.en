Maintenance day at the small 'Engl채nderh체tte'
For what was then the fifth maintenance day in the follow-up to the Natura 2000 project in Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small Engl채nderh체tte (Englishman's Cottage) in Ibach
Following suggestions from the population, the of the valley in the area of the cottage was to be cleared, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
According to Kaiser, many hikers refer to this area as the showpiece of the Schluchtensteig, where the landscape provides the ideal framework for fantastic views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasised that the maintenance day is a suitable instrument through which to strengthen the connection between people and nature,
He is offering every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental aspects should also be taken into consideration.
This environmental aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Regional Council, following the greeting by Regional Councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had taken on the role of patron and wished the campaign every success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist objective of the vision coincided with the goal of preserving the now extremely overgrown old Allmend grazing pasture, with its specific protected habitats, through its opening and connection to the still existing grazing land.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies or grasshoppers, cannot get past barriers in the form of forest areas.
They require these clear pathways in order to preserve their species.
Tribukait said that she did not want to fail to use this opportunity to say a word in defence of the planned biosphere area.
The current measures do not integrate seamlessly into these plans.
A biosphere area offers the chance for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status, and thus offers an extension to what has been achieved thus far with the Life Project and the previous care days.
After the various statements, forest ranger Christoph Wehle and Life Project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had been cut down in advance, although forest tractors were on-call if required.
One group of helpers were to take care of the clearance of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone wall.
The objective was to create a clear view at the viewpoint.
