Dog-lovers victorious
Once again the athletes from the Bitz dog-lovers association were victorious at a Rally Obedience Tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started things off in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he achieved 94 points in the Beginners class and thus took fifth place, while with 15-month-old Marley he took twelfth place with 87 points.
With her dog Woody competing in the Class 1 competition, Susi HÃ¶pp was subject to the critical scrutiny of the judge.
