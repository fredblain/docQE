Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill playmate with machetes
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two boys, aged 14 and 12, had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
On Tuesday, armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old to death and threw the body into a well, reported the "El Pa√≠s" newspaper on Thursday.
They then went and played football in front of their homes in a working class district.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres to the north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
A five year-old half-sister of the younger offender, who they took with them, was to make a statement as an alibi, stating that she was sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the progression of events to the police without mentioning an attack against herself, the two boys confessed to the pre-meditated murder of the 11-year-old.
The older of the pair cited a rivalry on the football field as the motive.
He was provisionally taken to a psychiatric young offenders institute.
