Norway: Norwegian village lights itself up with huge mirrors
Using huge mirrors, the residents of a Norwegian village have brought light to their dreary valley.
Due to the low level of sunshine, from autumn until spring the village of Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley normally languishes in the shadows of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic mirrors, each 45 metres tall, a centuries-old dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!', raved Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the inaugural ceremony, televised by broadcaster TV2.
Some valley residents lay back on sun loungers, while others safely put on their sunglasses.
Up until now, those hungry for sunshine in the winter had to travel to a nearby peak by cable car.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal of directing the sun into the valley using mirrors.
However, this basic idea had been talked of in the location since 1913.
After several years of debate, the Town Council finally approved the project, which cost 5 million krone (around EUR 615,000).
A similar construction has provided sunshine to the Italian alpine resort of Viganella for a number of years.
