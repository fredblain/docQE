Freudenstadt: Quick moves take hosts by surprise
With a slender squad, the TSV Freudenstadt Herren I team (Men's First Team) stepped into the Schiller School Gymnasium in Reutlingen to face TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb region.
The Alb men stood on the other side of the net with what was undoubtedly a more experienced team.
However, it soon became evident that, due in part to their age, they could not really keep up with the fast pace of the Freudenstadt team.
Gönningen found it extremely difficult to cope with the hard and well-positioned offensive moves.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks coming cleanly over the net from Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz and their blocking game was not up to scratch.
Clear victories in the first two sets clearly demonstrated the superiority of the Freudenstadt team in all areas.
Faced with this overwhelming and match-determining performance, the third set was won following a somewhat tame and spiritless performance, for a final score of 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, when they play TV Baiersbronn, who managed a clear victory in Nagold, they will step onto the court to face a much stronger opponent.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B Class, two teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced off in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They produced a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nerves on both sides, particularly when receiving the ball, resulted in errors and lost points; there was even a lack of passing at times and at some critical moments overeagerness saw potential points wasted.
However, in this evenly matched game, the great physical effort of Marcus Blasutto's TSV team proved decisive in spite of tremendous commitment by both teams.
