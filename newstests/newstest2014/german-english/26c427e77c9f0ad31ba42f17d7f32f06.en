On the happiness of dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels manage to reach
It was with this piece of Bedouin wisdom that the first ever chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination behind the "Helping Hands" society.
Saturday evening saw the celebration of the tenth birthday of the organisation, which can already look back on impressive results.
Founding Chairman Henne reported in depth on the work of the organisation.
In 2004, he visited the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott in Mauritania for the first time.
As a result, an important collaboration was developed and the gynaecologist, Hanne, has performed countless operations on several journeys to the location.
During the speech, images from the trips were shown on a large screen, in order to give the guests at the anniversary event an insight into the initiatives mentioned.
The organisation's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former Lord Mayor of Nagold, made the suggestion of equipping this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and, according to Henne, he is now planning to assume an advisory role within the organisation.
In 2008, the Schleeh carpentry company from Baiersbronn built the hospital station in Socogim, a poor district on the edge of the Capital, in the record time of less than one week - free of charge.
Henne also mentioned a new mother and child hospital in Nouakchott
This is particularly interesting at a time when Nagold is set to do away with its maternity clinic.
You learn a great deal working as a doctor in Africa, said Henne, for example that you should slow down to avoid burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it has not been possible to make as many journeys as planned, but for this reason, many local doctors have come to Germany, to sit in on lectures on a variety of topics.
In addition, containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa, for example in March of this year when medical devices, medicines, bandaging material, hospital beds and spectacles were sent.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour, telling of Mercedes vehicles in Mauritania converted into mobile goat stalls and sharing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the organisation on their trips to Mauritania.
He identified his personal motivation as being his work in the area of auditing as a young member of parliament.
When it became clear to him how much money is wasted, he decided to help the Africans with controlling of their budget by the people.
Fuchtel also emphasised that a global economy requires global human kindness.
The fact that Africa lies closer than many think should by no means be forgotten.
Africa is not at all that far from Gran Canaria.
