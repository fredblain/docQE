Jumbo visits the home of Black Forest ham
Jumbo on the search for the "world's best ham": For the TV programme "Galileo", the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The presenter established one thing right from the outset: The most important thing when it comes to ham are the legs of pork - turbo fattening does not provide a good basis for this.
Can ham bought in a supermarket be as good as a quality product?
Uli, boss of the large ham factory in Schwarzwald, explained to Jumbo how the Bonndorf company, "Adler", operates.
"Germany's most-loved ham," said Jumbo, presenting the Black Forest ham.
He could only enter the factory when wearing hair protection and a white coat.
Jumbo also had to first disinfect his hands before he could reach for the microphone.

"Here they work with huge quantities," commented the television producers, astonished by the mass production of Black Forest ham.
16,000 joints of meat per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content and colour: Uli explained what was required for the best quality.
The majority of the pigs are slaughtered at six months old.
Television with standards?
Even specific details such as the pH value of the meat play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.
"I would be curious what would happen if you were to measure Roberto Blanco," said Jumbo cynically.
Here the standard of private television production is presented in its purest form.
Nonetheless, it is worth watching.
The viewer sees that joints are still carved by hand.
After all: Black Forest ham traditionally arrives on the shelf boneless.
The secret of the ham is the mix of herbs combined with salt.
The appearance of the smoking tower and furnace remind Jumbo of a submarine.
The trick: Here fir branches in the smoker provide the special flavour of Black Forest ham.
After 20 days in the smoke, the ham is finally almost black.
"And now the slice will disappear inside Jumbo," he said, announcing his sampling of the product.
"That is really delicious," said the TV star in conclusion.
All those involved will be happy with that evaluation.
